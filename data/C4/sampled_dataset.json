But equally important for investors is the conference call, where management&apos;s commentary provides the full picture of the company&apos;s recent performance.Let&apos;s look at some highlights from Johnson Controls&apos; (NYSE: JCI)most recent conference call to help discern the full picture for Q3 2016.\nExcluding foreign exchange, the building efficiency segment reported a 48% year-over-year improvement in segment margin -- an improvement which management attributed \"primarily to the volumes in North America and Asia and the contribution of the Hitachi joint venture.\"\nThat&apos;s putting it mildly. According to the company&apos;s 10-Q, the joint venture with Hitachi yielded $826 million in sales for the quarter and $111 million in segment income.\nJust the start of start-stop?\nManagement&apos;s enthusiasm for seizing the start-stop vehicle market opportunity is no surprise. Earlier in the summer, it announced its intent to invest $780 million from 2015 through 2020 to expandits absorbent glass mat (AGM) battery manufacturing capacity.\nJohnson Controls&apos; heavy-duty truck AGM batteries offer twice the performance and life of flooded batteries. Image source: Johnson Controls.\nFound in start-stop vehicles, whose engines shut off when the engine is idle, AGM batteries are designed to handle the additional stresses placed on them as the vehicles maintain power to other systems until the driver releases the brake or clutch.\nWhat does come as a surprise, though, is the success the company is already recognizing from its AGM offerings. According to management, \"start-stop growth, which is the future of our business over the next five years\" increased 22% year over year during the quarter, driven primarily by the Americas and China, which increased 78% and 79%, respectively.\nBesides adhering well to the expected timeline of events, management is also crediting itself with how well it has been able to execute the transition in terms of staying on budget. Previous estimates had targeted separation costs between $400 million and $600 million, and according to McDonald, management is \"tracking well within those estimates.\"\nAlthough it was glad to report its success in beating Q3 estimates by $0.04 and reporting EPS of $1.07, management was especially keen on identifying the factors that will contribute to its future success. In doing so, investors have a clear list of items they can track to also gauge the company&apos;s operations.\nFor one, Hitachi significantly contributed to growth in the building efficiency segment, but management expects the growth to continue. Likewise, AGM revenue growth in both the Americas and Chinese markets drove gains in the power solutions segment, but management believes there&apos;s plenty of market opportunity left to seize. Look in the coming quarters for continued increases in sales for start-stop batteries, for slowing growth could suggest management&apos;s enthusiasm for expanding production capacity may have been misguided. And lastly, investors should keep an eye on how well the Adient separation is progressing. If November rolls around and the company is not operating on its own, Johnson Controls may be looking at separation costs exceeding the planned $600 million.\nScott Levine has no position in any stocks mentioned.

That\u2019s an extreme distillation of what is really a very rich and complicated memoir from the journalist, academic and critic. However, it isn\u2019t too far off the mark in terms of what consumed him in those early years \u2014 his family and school life, friendships, his curiosity about and interest in the arts, but also, the abuse he still struggles to survive.\nCaveney\u2019s parents were modest people. His mother was a millworker, his father a groundskeeper. Referring to his parents by their first names, Kathleen and Jack, Caveney details his formative years with the simple, earnest, chain-smoking parents who never managed to move past the confines of their small burgh.\nBut Caveney did. He managed to win a spot at a Catholic school away from home. Here he fed his insatiable curiosity for learning, his penchant for literature, and his obsession with popular music, plays, movies and books, concerns that move him further from an easy communication with his parents and extended family.\nThese are also matters, however, that move him closer to \u201cRev Kev,\u201d the headmaster at his new school. The charismatic priest takes Graham under his wing. He recognizes in his young charge undeniable intellectual gifts, but perhaps zeroes in on his vulnerabilities. After a trip to the theater and meaningful discussions about the stage production of \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d the priest molests the boy.\nThis is a difficult book, and there are scenes where Caveney spares no disturbing detail about the abuse and the ways in which trauma begins to consume his life. He suffers panic attacks, alcoholism and drug addiction. But it is also funny in unexpected ways, particularly for those who came of age in the \u201960s and \u201970s. Caveney craves acceptance from the family he doesn\u2019t have much in common with, close friends he admires (but doesn\u2019t confide in) and his repeated returning to the refuge and redemption of music.\nIn the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp, we should not be desensitized to what Caveney describes as having occurred decades ago. The effects are insidious and long-lasting. He was a minor. He and his parents had an implicit trust in Rev Kev \u2014 as both priest and teacher. But Caveney does underscore the ways in which lopsided power dynamics undermine logic, morality, love and trust.\n\u201cMisery memoirs\u201d about trauma and addiction are, lamentably, all too common, but the \u201cBoy\u201d of the title, Caveney, also offers us a story of survival and even of celebrating all the other things we carry that far outweigh the wreckage.\nYvette Benavides is a professor of English and creative writing at Our Lady of the Lake University.", "The California Energy Commission has approved a new regulation requiring all new home construction to include solar panels. This, in spite of California having the highest housing costs in the country and a widespread housing shortage.\nMuch of the underlying rationale for the requirement stems from California\u2019s concerns about climate change and the state\u2019s ambitious low-carbon objectives. Coincidentally, on the same day of the commission\u2019s solar mandate announcement, California\u2019s EPA released a report on the impacts of climate change on the state.\nAs the battle of ideas over America\u2019s power sector continues, a few points are worth raising about California\u2019s solar requirement and how California\u2019s renewables-centric approach compares with other states where the approach is more diversity-centric. Once case being the state of Georgia, home to the only nuclear construction project in the U.S.\nFirst, California is, in essence, requiring each new home construction to serve double-duty as a decentralized independent power producer for generating electricity using a preferred energy resource \u2014 solar. Given the context of California\u2019s 50 percent-by-2030 renewables goal for electricity and its recent decision to shut down the state's last remaining nuclear plant, this new regulation is a clear case of using policy to choose winners.\nSecond, California has a very progressive net-metering policy that provides credit to customers with solar PV systems for the full retail value of the electricity their system generates.\nMoreover, solar PV system owners who generate a net surplus over the course of the year can receive payment for that surplus under special utility tariffs. This creates financial conditions that may very well result in the average saving of $80 per month on a customer's utility bill as projected in the new regulation.\nHowever, it comes at the expense of customers who don\u2019t have, or can\u2019t afford, solar PV systems, thus creating cross-subsidies. Moreover, a California resident can save the projected $80 per month fairly quickly since the average residential rate is about 19.15 cents/kWhr compared with a state such as Georgia where the rate is around 10.83 cents/kWhr.\nLastly, California\u2019s energy policy approach whereby nuclear is abandoned, renewables are emphasized and solar is required for new home construction, is just one example of an individual state\u2019s preference in deciding the best way forward for its electric power sector and citizens.\nBy comparison, the state of Georgia is taking a much different approach with its own transition from coal to natural gas, a steady integration of utility-scale solar, and the construction of two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.\nWhile the Vogtle project has faced challenges with meeting timelines and staying within budget following a 30-year dormancy in U.S. nuclear power projects, the construction of these reactors represents a vital contribution to national security as it sustains activity in the U.S. nuclear power sector and signals to the world that the U.S. has not altogether abandoned its legacy role of responsibility and stewardship in the global nuclear cycle \u2014 a role that has provided the world with unparalleled leadership and standards in safety.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in 2009 the Georgia state legislature passed a bill allowing a Nuclear Construction Cost Recovery (NCCR) tariff for recovering the cost of financing associated with the Vogtle reactors, which is saving ratepayers millions of dollars in interest charges. This is in contrast with California\u2019s solar PV mandate, which is projected to increase monthly mortgages by $40.\nWhile Vogtle will generate electricity with a capacity factor of 93 percent over 60-plus years, California\u2019s mandated solar PV systems will operate at a capacity factor of about 18 percent over 20 to 25 years.\nThese are two fundamentally different ideologies for investing in zero-carbon energy resources. Moreover, if California is applauded for battling climate change by way of its solar mandate and other renewable energy efforts, then Georgia certainly deserves applause for fighting that same battle, yet also making critical contributions to national security with new nuclear power construction at Vogtle.\nNonetheless, this reflects the right of individual states to govern their energy policy under the auspices of their respective state leadership. It also reflects the reality that the U.S. remains locked in a battle of ideas among various states as to how the nation\u2019s electric power sector should be organized in order to meet the multiple objectives of reliability, affordability, safety, carbon reduction and national security.\nWhile this battle may be inevitable due to divergent ideologies across state lines, it is imprudent and altogether unnecessary for U.S. nuclear power to become a casualty in that battle because the prospect of an America without nuclear power not only calls into question whether the U.S. can meet low-carbon objectives reliably and affordably, it also represents national security risks with which America should never experiment.\nDavid Gattie is an associate professor of engineering in the College of Engineering at the University of Georgia. His research focus is energy policy and the electric power sector, and he teaches courses in energy systems and security for the Master of International Policy program in UGA\u2019s Center for International Trade and Security.

I subsequently used my column space to support that legislation. This represents an obvious conflict of interests. People have used this conflict of interests to portray my column as being paid for by the Bush Administration. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nAt the same time, I understand that I exercised bad judgment in running paid advertising for an issue that I frequently write about in my column. People need to know that my column is uncorrupted by any outside influences. I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for my bad judgment, and to better explain the circumstances.\nIn 2003 Ketchum Communications contacted a small PR firm that I own, Graham Williams Group, to buy ad space on a television show that I own and host. The ad was to promote The Department of Education?s ?No Child Left Behind? plan. I have long felt that school vouchers hold the greatest promise of ending the racial education gap in this country. We need to hold schools accountable for their failures and create incentives to change. That is why I have vigorously supported school vouchers for the past decade?in print, on TV, during media appearances and in lectures. I believe that school vouchers represent the greatest chance of stimulating hope for young, inner city school children?often of color. In fact, I am a board member of Black Americans for Educational Options (BAEO), because I feel that school choice plans hold the promise of a new civil rights movement.\nIn the past I have used my column space to convey the promise of school options. I continued to do so, even after receiving money to run a series of ads on my television show promoting the ?No Child Left Behind? act. I now realize that I exercised poor judgment in continuing to write about a topic which my PR firm was being paid to promote.\nThe fact is, I run a small business. I am CEO and manage the syndication and advertising for my television show. In between juggling my commentaries and media appearances, I stepped over the line. This has never happened before. In fact, my company has never worked on a government contract. Nor have we ever received compensation for an issue that I subsequently reported on. This will never happen again. I now realize that I have to create inseparable boundaries between my role as a small businessman and my role as an independent commentator.\nI also understand that people must be able to trust that my commentary is unbiased. Please know that I supported school vouchers long before the Department of Education ran a single ad on my TV Show. I did not change my views just because my PR firm was receiving paid advertising promoting the No Child Left Behind Act. I did however exercise bad judgment by accepting advertising for an issue that I frequently write about in my column. I apologize for this bad judgment, for creating questions in people?s minds as to whether my commentary was sincere, and for bringing shame and embarrassment to the newspapers that run my commentary.\nI accept full responsibility for my lack of good judgment. I am paying the price. Tribune Media has cancelled my column. And I have learned a valuable lesson. I just want to assure you that this will never happen again, and to ask for your forgiveness.\nI hope that we can put this mistake behind us, and that I can continue to bring the same unique and impassioned perspective that I brought to this space in the past.", "Australia will abolish a popular work visa used by over 95,000 foreign workers, majority of them Indians, to tackle the growing unemployment in the country and replace it with a new programme requiring higher English-language profiency and job skills.\nThe programme known as 457 visa allows business to employ foreign workers for a period up to four years in skilled jobs where there is a shortage of Australian workers.\n\"We are an immigration nation, but the fact remains: Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs, so we are abolishing the 457 visa, the visa that brings temporary foreign workers into our country,\" said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\nThe majority of the visa holders under this category were from India, accounting almost a quarter of the intake, followed by the UK and China at 19.5 per cent and 5. 8 per cent respectively, ABC reported.\n\"We will no longer allow 457 visa to be passports to jobs that could and should go to Australians,\" he said.\nHe said Australia will adopt a new 'Australians first' approach to skilled migration.\nAs at September 30 last year there were 95,757 workers in Australia on primary 457 visas and 76,430 secondary visa holders (members of their family), the report said.\nThe programme will be replaced by another visa programme, with new restrictions.\n\"It is important businesses still get access to the skills they need to grow and invest, so the 457 visa will be replaced by a new temporary visa, specifically designed to recruit the best and brightest in the national interest,\" Turnbull said.\nTurnbull said the new programme will ensure that foreign workers are brought into Australia in order to fill critical skill gaps and not brought in because an employer finds it easier to recruit a foreign worker than go to the trouble of hiring an Australian.\nThe new visa will include mandatory criminal checks and tighter English language requirements.\nThe new 'Temporary Skill Shortage Visa' programme will comprise two streams \u2013 Short Term and Medium Term \u2013 and will be underpinned by more focused occupation lists that are responsive to genuine skill needs and regional variations across Australia.\nShort term visas will be issued for two years, while medium term visas will be issued only for more critical skills shortages and for up to four years.\nBoth streams will include mandatory labour market testing with limited exemptions, a new non-discriminatory workforce test; mandatory criminal history checks, a market salary rate assessment and a new two-year work experience requirement.\nAdditionally there will be tightened English language requirements for the Medium Term Stream.\nThe new visa will also include a strengthened training obligation for employers sponsoring foreign skilled workers to provide enhanced training outcomes for Australians in high- need industries and occupations.\nThese changes will give Australian job seekers more opportunity to find work while finding the right balance so businesses can prosper by acquiring the expertise they need.\nTurnbull stressed that migration was an integral part of the Australian story and its success had helped the nation to become the world's most successful multicultural nation.\n\"There is no doubt foreign workers have played a significant role in the remarkable economic growth of the nation,\" he said.\n\"More than 100,000 workers from 30 countries helped build the Snowy Hydro Scheme while John Howard's (former Australian prime minister) decision to focus our permanent migration programme on bringing in skills has helped the nation enjoy more than two decades of continued economic growth,\" Turnbull added.\nImplementation of the new visa will begin immediately, with full implementation to be completed by March 2018.\nAustralia India Business Council (AIBC) national chair Sheba Nandkeolyar said the news about 457 visa scrapping has come as a surprise.\n\"This may perhaps impact not merely Indian companies in Australia but also Australian companies - many of who tap into international skills in digital, analytical and engineering areas,\" Nandkeolyar said.\n\"However, the Prime Minister did advise that there will be a new visa category introduced for the critical skills shortage areas, and I hope this will impact positively on the Indian IT/ICT industry, among others,\" she said.\nThe 457 visa was introduced in the 1990s to quicken the entry of business professionals and highly skilled migrants but over time it was opened up for a broad category of workers.\nThe programme was hit by controversy with allegations that the visa was being misused by employers to import cheap workers who lack necessary skills.\nTurnbull's announcement comes days after he visited India where a range of issues, including national security, counter terrorism, education and energy, were discussed and six agreements were signed.", "Nowhere does the battle over outsourcing rage more fiercely than in the halls of the Pentagon.\nThe Defense Department finds itself in the throes of a debate that might, over time, make it yield its control to commercial forces and lose forever the tools it will need to fight on distant battlefields.\nSince the mid-1960s, DOD has engaged in a robust contracting-out program. According to a Business Executives for National Security special report, nearly every support function in Defense has been outsourced to some degree, including 47 percent of data processing.\nThere are exceptions. Outsourcing at the Army's White Sands Missile Range is a case in point. According to former commander Brig. Gen. Harry D. Gatanas, the range, set in a remote part of the New Mexico desert, survived 22 studies conducted under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76. Arbitrators concluded that a streamlined, adequately equipped government work force could perform the White Sands duties more effectively than contractors.\nIn fact, the A-76 study might have done the range work force a favor by forcing the organization to modernize its operation.\nJohn Thorpe, deputy chief of information management for the Army-Pacific, pointed out that in Hawaii, the Army outsourced its end-to-end telephone services several years ago. Yet, Thorpe said, the cost of this system continually rises by as much as 30 percent a year.\nZeroing in on the 516th Signal Brigade, across-the-board outsourcing was supposed to cut costs, improve service and help organizations adopt new technology quickly. But those benefits haven't materialized. Problems with security clearances and high employee turnover have plagued government management. Still, you could postulate that on the U.S. mainland, with so many vendors available, the military could outsource a lot more than it currently does. But, under provisions of the Federal Activities Reform Act of 1998, for a federal function to be outsourced, it must be nongovernmental. Shouldn't this proviso exempt DOD?\nA Defense agency's systems communications may not be inherently governmental, but using these tools to conduct command and control activities in combat certainly is. An information-based Army must retain the core competencies necessary to operate and maintain its information technology.\nIn Huntsville, Ala., the Army's Directorate of Information Management is working to reverse an outsourcing process established several years ago. Why? Officials there cite rising costs and loss of control. Information management is a core military function'now more than ever.\nReversibility is another concern. GSA said, 'Once IT functions have been turned over to a contractor, it will be too costly to reverse the situation'' The advent of hostilities is no time to attempt to revert to in-house management of C2 systems.\nUnfortunately, these purely strategic and tactical concerns have not slowed the pace of A-76 studies. The Pentagon brass feel the pressure of their ambitious, short-term cost-cutting promises. These amount to some $11 billion by 2005, according to published reports, and could affect 229,000 positions.\nIT is supposed to provide the strategic and tactical backbone of the Army in the years to come. Technology cannot be separated out because of a shortsighted need to show cost savings.\nThe Outsourcing Institute, referenced in the same GSA report, offers this observation: 'Overemphasis on short-term benefits is a clear sign of an outsourcing project that will prove unsuccessful.' Only an in-house Army work force can define the evolving information infrastructure the service will need to support the promise of Joint Vision 2020 and DOD's knowledge-centric Global Information Grid.\nThe Army must not base its modernization decisions solely on savings, because to do so could undermine its ability to provide end-to-end command and control connectivity.\nArmy Col.

Investigators determined she was strangled and struck at least 36 times with a \"tire thumper,\" a club used by truckers to check tire pressure. Her husband, a truck driver, had given her the tire thumper for protection while he was on the road. Lee says he is innocent of the crime.\n5:30 p.m.: Lee's last meal was communion at 4 p.m., according to Solomon Graves, Arkansas Department of Correction spokesman.\n6 p.m.: John Moritz of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Sean Murphy of the Associated Press and Marine Glisovic of KATV, Channel 7 will be the media witnesses. The state has relented on its inane policy to not allow reporters who view the execution to bring in notepads and pens. It will now provide the three reporters with pen and paper.\nMurphy, who works for the AP in Oklahoma, witnessed the botched execution of Clayton Lockett in that state in 2014.\n6:16 p.m.: JR Davis, spokesman for Governor Hutchinson, says the governor is at the Capitol. \"Lines of communication are absolutely open,\" Davis said. The governor is \"prepared from all sides.\"\nMedia witnesses have left for the execution viewing room.\nLate this afternoon, the Innocence Project and the ACLU joined in filing an emergency civil rights lawsuit in federal court. The attorney general then filed a response.\nAn emergency request for a stay is still before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe governor could grant executive clemency.\n6:25 p.m.: Graves takes his place next to a phone that goes to the execution chamber.\n6:42 p.m.: If Lee's execution goes through it will be the first time the state has ever used the controversial midazolam sedative in its three-drug protocol. The next drug is vecuronium bromide, a paralytic. The third is potassium chloride, which causes a heart attack. This procedure, critics have worried, could leave a prisoner conscious during the procedure. An Arkansas Department of Correction official confirmed that it will perform consciousness checks five minutes after the midazolam is administered to ensure the inmate is insensate as protocol dictates. (ADC has failed to reveal what constitutes a consciousness check). AP Reporter Sean Murphy said that he will be counting minutes to ensure that five minutes have passed and that consciousness checks occur.\n6:59 p.m.: The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a stay of the execution of Lee until 8:15 p.m., according to ADC's Graves. Not the U.S. Supreme Court as we originally reported.\n7:25 p.m.: The U.S. Supreme Court has denied inmates motions for a stay and refused to grant certiorari in another case.\nIn the main case, the appeal of the 8th Circuit's reversal of U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker's preliminary injunction, the court split 5-4. The court's four liberal justices would have granted a stay. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent. As did Justice Stephen Breyer.\nI believe this is Justice Neil Gorsuch's first vote. Had Senate Republicans not blocked the confirmation of Merrick Garland or had Clinton beat Trump, would the decision have been different?\nArkansas set out to execute eight people over the course of 11 days. Why these eight? Why now? The apparent reason has nothing to do with the heinousness of their crimes or with the presence (or absence) of mitigating behavior. It has nothing to do with their mental state. It has nothing to do with the need for speedy punishment. Four have been on death row for over 20 years. All have been housed in solitary confinement for at least 10 years. Apparently the reason the State decided to proceed with these eight executions is that the \u2018use by\u2019 date of the State\u2019s execution drug is about to expire.\nAfter a four-day evidentiary hearing at which seventeen witnesses testified and volumes of evidence were introduced, the District Court issued an exhaustive 101-page opinion enjoining petitioners\u2019 executions. The court found that Arkansas\u2019 current lethal-injection protocol posed a substantial risk of severe pain and that petitioners had identified available alternative methods of execution. The Eighth Circuit reversed these findings in a six-page opinion.\nAs Judge Kelly noted persuasively in dissent, the Eighth Circuit erred at both steps of the analysis required by Glossip v. Gross ... First, it failed to defer to the District Court\u2019s extensive factual findings andinstead substituted its own. ... The Court of Appeals thus erroneously swept aside the District Court\u2019s well-supported finding that midazolam creates a substantial risk of severe pain. Second, it imposed a restrictive view of what qualifies as an \u201cavailable\u201dalternative under Glossip. I continue to harbor significant doubts about the wisdom of imposing the perverse requirement that inmates offer alternative methods for their own executions. ... But given the life or death consequences, the Court, having imposed this requirement, should provide clarification and guidance when the Circuits are divided as to its meaning.\nHere is the denial of the stay pending consideration of a rehearing of the Johnson v Kelley case. Three of the Supreme Court's liberal justices, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented, but not Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nHere is the denial of cert in the Johnson v. Kelley case. Breyer dissented.\n7:42 p.m.: Graves says that Lee \"was never moved into the [execution] chamber prior to the issuance of the stay.\" Earlier Graves said he is \"most likely with his attorney and, if he selected one, a spiritual advisor.\"\nFrom earlier, Buzzfeed's Supreme Court correspondent Chris Geidner says there are three new stay requests at the U.S. Supreme Court for Ledell Lee.\nTwo of the motions are from the Innocence Project and the ACLU and concern DNA testing. Another one is from all of the prisoners scheduled to be executed and makes a due process claim related to the compressed clemency schedule.\n8:15 p.m. In an order from Justice Samuel Alito, the execution is now stayed until 8:30 p.m. or further word from Alito. Here it is.\n8:25 p.m.: The 8th Circuit has extended its stay until 9:15 p.m.\n8:35 p.m.: JR Davis, spokesman for Governor Hutchinson, says there is no concern of guilt in these cases.\nOutside the prison, Judy Robinson-Johnson, wife of inmate Stacy Johnson, who was scheduled to be executed tonight before the Arkansas Supreme Court granted a stay to allow for new DNA testing. She tells David Koon she believes Johnson is innocent. She said if she could talk to Governor Hutchinson, she would try to appeal to his heart.\n8:40 p.m.: A reminder that Arkansas planned, originally, to do four double executions. On Monday night with just one and tonight with just one, legal challenges have pushed them back and complicated the process. When correction officer' and lawyers discuss the \"stress\" of an execution, they are not just referring to the unbelievable burden of killing someone. They also are talking about what we're seeing now: a complex legal process that means Lee and the people set to kill him are waiting, wondering what will happen next. Still to come are the parts that so many have been worried about, the administration of IV in a stressful situation and the use of the controversial sedative midazolam.\nJacob Rosenberg wrote about the stress of executions and the concerns about midazolam in a cover story for the Arkansas Times.\nKelley said that Arkansas\u2019s planned use of an ultrasound machine in placing the IV would ensure the state does not make the same mistake.... \u201cWhat happened to Clayton Lockett can\u2019t happen here,\u201d she said.\nLockett was the death row inmate in Oklahoma whose execution was botched horribly.\n8:51 p.m.: The 8th Circuit denies an appeal for stay. Judge Kelly, the lone Democratic appointee on the court, \"reluctantly\" concurs.\nThere are still appeals before the 8th Circuit in addition to the three noted above before the U.S. Supreme Court. Follow Chris Geidner of Buzzfeed on Twitter to stay on top of legal filings.\nThe 8th Circuit has denied one of the cases involving DNA testing. And another one.\nLynn Jones, sister of Jack Jones, who is scheduled to be executed on Monday, shows her tattoo. It's a copy of how Jack Jones signs his letters to her. She tells David Koon there's no doubt her brother is guilty, but says execution is \"barbaric.\" She has asked ADC to witness the execution, but officials won't allow it.\n9:15 p.m.: Key clarification from Buzzfeed's Geidner: Alito's stay was 8:30 p.m. or word from the court, whichever was LATER. In other words, now that 8:30 p.m. has passed, the state is waiting for the court to tell it to move forward.\nAgain, no matter how you feel about the death penalty, there is a significant split among U.S. Court of Appeals on how to interpret the U.S. Supreme Court on execution procedures that involve midazolam, a drug that many experts say has lead to several botched executions. So in Ohio, a similarly situated death row inmate's execution was put off, while Arkansas prepares to execute Lee.

Even after DNA testing was completed in my case, which excluded me from the crime scene, I sat on death row for two more years as the state wrestled endlessly to cover it up and kill me.\n10:25 p.m.: David Koon shares a shot of anti-death penalty advocates holding vigil outside the Governor's Mansion.\n10:56 p.m.: The stay continues.

But while posture correction is proving to be big business, what exactly is ideal posture?\nThe other day, I caught a glimpse of myself in an office window and noticed that I wore my body awkwardly, like an ill-fitting suit. My back was stiff. My head poked forward. My shoulders rounded inward slightly, which might have looked natural if I were moving in to hug someone, but I wasn't.\nMy rumpled reflection was a wake-up call. After years of slumping over a keyboard, I had developed the posture of a wilted parsley stalk. It was time to do something about it. But as I discovered, straightening up is not as straightforward as it might seem.\nImproving one's posture is not merely about looking better, although it's hard to deny the allure of appearing more poised, confident and self-possessed. Some studies have linked poor posture with a greater risk of sports and overuse injuries. There's debate over the extent to which it leads to neck and back pain, but even experts who are skeptical that posture is a primary cause of pain agree it can be, at least, a contributing factor.\nSo it's no wonder that posture correction is big business. Wearable activity trackers and apps, such as Lumo Lift and Upright, serve as virtual posture coaches, giving users instant feedback whenever they sense them slouching. Posture-correction garments, such as the Up Shirt, are designed to pull the wearers' shoulders back when they start to hunch forward, while Alignmed workout gear claims to stimulate specific muscle groups to keep wearers in proper form. Ergonomic seats such as the BackJoy SitSmart promise to position one's body in correct posture.\nBut what exactly is ideal posture? Are you supposed to tuck your tail bone in, as a yoga teacher once told me? Or is it better to release your pelvis? Do you roll your shoulders back? Or let them drop away from your ears?\n\"You ask medical doctors, they don't know what good posture means. You ask fitness club people, they probably each have a different idea about good posture. Ballet people, they think good posture is ballet [posture],\" says Toshie Okabe, a Toronto posture teacher and former professional ballet dancer. \"We don't really have a good standard for good posture.\"\nIn fact, the closest I could find to a commonly agreed upon definition of good posture was described by Prof. Leon Straker of the school of physiotherapy and exercise science at Curtin University in Perth, Australia.\n\"Traditionally we have thought of 'good' spinal posture as being upright and avoiding the increased mechanical loading that comes with bent and twisted postures,\" he wrote in an e-mail. That is, good posture is whatever way we hold our bodies that creates the least amount of strain.\nSince everybody's different, it's difficult to be more precise. The ideal, most strain-free posture for one person isn't necessarily ideal for someone else.\n\"Although posture is basic in nature and more or less innately learned from childhood, the literature still often contradicts itself and, in reality, the same principles of posture do not always apply to general populations in all situations, so blanket advice can be a challenge,\" explained Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Rowe, the physiotherapy national practice leader at the Canadian Forces Health Services Group Headquarters.\nBut there's another reason why it's so hard to get straight answers about how to achieve good posture. Posture is not just a health issue, it's also a cultural one. Historically, guidance on posture was based on social expectations, not medical research. Early codified standards for posture can be traced back to the etiquette manuals of the late 18th century, when posture was considered a demonstration of one's character, co-authors David Yosifon and Peter N. Stearns wrote in a 1998 paper, The Rise and Fall of American Posture, published in the American Historical Review.\nThus, some of our long-held beliefs about attaining good posture \u2013 pointers such as chest out, chin up \u2013 have been based on how to avoid looking like a slob, rather than any biomechanical reasons.\nStill, some experts suggest we can learn to improve our posture by looking to the past \u2013 specifically our own past.\n\"Good posture is when you were like maybe [age] three or four. You stood up, you did not have any back pain, neck pain. You were able to move freely,\" Okabe said. Rather than building six-pack abs and cement-strength core muscles, she told me, the aim is to return to \"your best possible comfortable, best functioning posture, which goes back to when you were much younger.\"\nIn her modest downtown studio, Okabe watched me move toward a chair and sit down. My hips and lower back were stiff \u2013 that much was obvious. And the way I carried myself put excessive strain on my shoulders and upper arms, she told me, as she gently squeezed my triceps. I hadn't even noticed.\nOkabe, who teaches a movement-training method called the Mitzvah Technique, explained that poor posture occurs in a chain reaction: When you habitually strain one part of your body, you begin to contort other parts to compensate.\nIn my case, Okabe observed I was the classic case of someone who has a desk job. All that sitting, with my spine curved forward to peer at my computer screen, caused me to tense in the upper arms and shoulders. In response, I had become lopsided, kind of like the way a tube of toothpaste buckles when you squeeze too hard. In the mirrored wall, she pointed out that my left shoulder was slightly higher than my right. To realign myself, I was straining my lower back and hips.\nThe bad news was that my posture could get worse over time, as I adopted new bad habits to try to make up for earlier ones, she said. But the good news was, in my case and for many people, that posture problems aren't inborn. They're learned. And if they're learned, that means it's possible to unlearn them.\nThe Globe\u2019s Wency Leung demonstrates sitting dos (below) and don\u2019ts (above). Some experts suggest we can learn to improve our posture by looking to our own past. Toronto posture teacher Toshie Okabe says your best posture goes back to when you were three or four years old.\nSince no one specifically tracks statistics on slouchers, it's hard to say how many people have poor posture. But many of the experts I spoke with believe it has become a growing problem, thanks in large part to our sedentary, screen-focused lifestyles.\nWe spend so much time hunched at our desks or bending our necks down to read our smartphones that these positions become ingrained in our regular movement patterns.\nIf you're like me, one of the biggest hurdles to improving your stance is that after years of slouching and straining, you lose sight of what it feels like to stand and sit at ease. Here are some of the tips I learned from the experts.\nLooking to fix her own back issues, Esther Gokhale, a Palo Alto, Calif., acupuncturist whom The New York Times dubbed the \"posture guru of Silicon Valley,\" travelled the world, observing groups that have yet to adopt a modern, digital lifestyle, such as in remote villages in Burkina Faso, India, Brazil and Portugal, where back pain is not common.\nOne of the features she noticed about these groups was what she calls their \"J-shaped spine.\" In other words, unlike our conventionally recognized \"S-shaped spines,\" with opposing curves in the upper (thoracic) and lower (lumbar) back, people with what she refers to as a \"primal posture\" have a straight upper back and a more pronounced curve in the lower spine.\nWith this posture, she noticed, potters, basket-makers and weavers could sit for long periods without strain.\n\"I think if you sit with good form in well-designed furniture for moderate durations, \u2026 then I think sitting is a healthy position,\" she said by phone.\nOne of the techniques for sitting, which Gokhale demonstrates in a TEDx talk and describes in her book 8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back, is called \"stretchsitting.\" You sit down into a firm chair with a low backrest, planting your buttocks at the back of the seat. Then, you place your feet about hip-distance apart and relax your legs.\nLengthen your spine, using your arms to push the top part of your trunk away from the lower part and then hitch your mid-back to the backrest of your chair. Finally, relax, letting the backrest prop you up.\nWhy make your back do the work of holding you upright when your chair can do it for you?\nTo demonstrate how I could lessen the load on my spine, Stuart McGill, a professor of spine biomechanics at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, asked me to stand up, keeping one hand at my side. He then instructed me to place the other hand on the two ribbons of muscle, the erector spinae muscles, at my lower back. When I stood tall, the muscles felt relaxed. But when I bent forward just a little, they stiffened. The same happened when he instructed me to stand tall and slouch my shoulders or jut my chin forward.\n\"Now pull your chin back and align your head over your hips, and you'll notice that the muscles relaxed again,\" he said. They did. This exercise gave me a handy gauge for correcting my posture.\nMcGill sent me a copy of his book, Back Mechanic: The Secrets to a Healthy Spine Your Doctor Isn't Telling You, promising I'd find answers to my specific back problems. In the book, I discovered that simply lying on my stomach helped eliminate spinal flexion from my many hours of sitting. It felt amazing just to relax into the floor.\nI was surprised to learn from McGill's book that some stretches and exercises that are commonly prescribed to improve posture actually put more load on the joints and unnecessarily compress the spine. These no-nos include touching your toes, lying on your back and bringing one or both knees to the chest, and the \"superman,\" an exercise where you lie on your stomach and lift your head and chest and feet off the floor.\nPerhaps an obvious but important lesson: If it doesn't feel good, don't do it.\nToshie Okabe, the Toronto posture teacher, warned me I shouldn't expect to fix my posture overnight. It takes time to unlearn bad habits, just as it took years to develop them.\nBut one simple thing she advised, which I could start doing immediately, was to get up every half-hour when working at my desk.\n\"We're not designed to sit still,\" Okabe said, explaining that even standing up briefly before sitting down again gives your muscles a break so they don't stay tensed in one position.\nLeon Straker, the physiotherapy professor in Australia, echoed this advice.\nInstead of trying to pursue the notion of an ideal posture, he said: \"Perhaps most importantly I would recommend 'the next' posture \u2013 that is to not hold any one posture for a prolonged period and ensure people have variety in their postures and move regularly.\"", "The Perfect Date soundtrack: Where can you find songs from the Netflix movie?\nEvery experience deserves its own soundtrack.

Bad air. Even the word is Italian, and this horrible disease marked the life of those in the peninsula for thousands of years. Giuseppe Garibaldi's wife died of the disease, as did the country's first prime minister, Cavour, in 1861. Yet by 1962, Italy was officially declared malaria-free, and it has remained so ever since. Frank Snowden's study of this success story is a remarkable piece of historical work. Original, crystal-clear, analytical and passionate, Snowden (who has previously written about cholera) takes us to areas historians have rarely visited before.\nEverybody now knows that malaria is carried by mosquitoes. But in the 19th century, most experts believed that the disease was produced by \"miasma\" or \"poisoning of the air\". Others made a link between swamps, water and malaria, but did not make the further leap towards insects. The consequences of these theories were that little was done to combat the disease before the end of the century. Things became so bad that 11m Italians (from a total population of 25m) were \"permanently at risk\". In malarial zones the life expectancy of land workers was a terrifying 22.5 years. Those who escaped death were weakened or suffered from splenomegaly - a \"painful enlargment of the spleen'\" and \"a lifeless stare\". The economic impact of the disease was immense. Epidemics were blamed on southern Italians, given the widespread belief that malaria was hereditary. In the 1880s, such theories began to collapse as the dreaded mosquito was identified as the real culprit.\nItalian scientists, drawing on the pioneering work of French doctor Alphonse Laveran, were able to predict the cycles of fever but it was in Rome that further key discoveries were made. Giovanni Battista Grassi, a naturalist, found that a particular type of mosquito was the carrier of malaria. By experimenting on healthy volunteers (mosquitoes were released into rooms where they drank the blood of the human guinea pigs), Grassi was able to make the direct link between the insects (all females of a certain kind) and the disease. Soon, doctors and scientists made another startling discovery: the mosquitoes themselves were also infected and not mere carriers. Every year, during the mosquito season, malarial blood was moved around the population by the insects. Definitive proof of these new theories was obtained after an extraordinary series of experiments in Italy, where healthy people were introduced into malarial zones but kept free of mosquito bites - and remained well. The new Italian state had the necessary information to tackle the disease.\nA complicated approach was adopted, which made use of quinine - a drug obtained from tree bark which had long been used to combat fever, but was now seen as a crucial part of the war on malaria. Italy introduced a quinine law and a quinine tax in 1904, and the drug was administered to large numbers of rural workers. Despite its often terrible side-effects (the headaches produced were known as the \"quinine-buzz\") the drug was successful in limiting the spread of the disease, and in breaking cycles of infection. In addition, Italy set up rural health centres and invested heavily in education programmes. Malaria, as Snowden shows, was not just a medical problem, but a social and regional issue, and could only be defeated through multi-layered strategies. Politics was itself transformed by the anti- malarial campaigns.\nIt was originally decided to give quinine to all those in certain regions - even healthy people; peasants were often suspicious of medicine being forced upon them. Doctors were sometimes met with hostility and refusal, and many were dubbed \"poisoners\".\nDespite these problems, the strategy was hugely successful. Deaths from malaria fell by some 80% in the first decade of the 20th century and some areas escaped altogether from the scourge of the disease. War, from 1915-18, delayed the campaign. Funds were diverted to the battlefields and the fight against malaria became a military issue, laying the way for the fascist approach to the problem. Mussolini's policies in the 20s and 30s are subjected to a serious cross-examination by Snowden. He shows how much of the regime's claims to have \"eradicated\" malaria through massive land reclamation, forced population removals and authoritarian clean-ups were pure propaganda. Mass draining was instituted - often at a great cost as Mussolini waged war not on the disease itself, but on the mosquitoes that carried it. The cleansing of Italy was also ethnic, as \"carefully selected\" Italians were chosen to inhabit the gleaming new towns of the former marshlands around Rome. The \"successes\" under fascism were extremely vulnerable, based as they were on a top-down concept of eradication. As war swept through the drained lands in the 40s, the disease returned with a vengeance.\nIn the most shocking part of the book, Snowden describes - passionately, but with the skill of a great historian - how the retreating Nazi armies in Italy in 1943-44 deliberately caused a massive malaria epidemic in Lazio. It was \"the only known example of biological warfare in 20th-century Europe\". The Germans flooded the plains at a certain point of the year, causing the maximum damage to the local population. This was yet another example of the \"total war\" waged by the Nazis upon the civilian population in Italy, a war which included massacres, theft and destruction. Ironically, it was the jewel in Mussolini's crown - the new city of Littoria (now Latina) which suffered the worst damage at the hands of his own allies.\nShamefully, the Italian malaria expert Alberto Missiroli had a role to play in the disaster: he did not distribute quinine, despite being well aware of the epidemic to come. Snowden claims that Missiroli was already preparing a new strategy - with the support of the US Rockefeller Foundation - using a new pesticide, DDT. Missiroli allowed the epidemic to spread, in order to create the ideal conditions for a massive, and lucrative, human experiment. Fifty-five thousand cases of malaria were recorded in the province of Littoria alone in 1944. It is estimated that more than a third of those in the affected area contracted the disease. Thousands, nobody knows how many, died.\nWith the war over, the US government and the Rockefeller Foundation were free to experiment. DDT was sprayed from the air and 3m Italians had their bodies covered with the chemical. The effects were dramatic, and nobody really cared about the toxic effects of the chemical. By 1962, malaria was more or less gone from the whole peninsula. The last cases were noted in a poor region of Sicily. One of the final victims to die of the disease in Italy was the popular cyclist, Fausto Coppi. He had contracted malaria in Africa in 1960, and the failure of doctors in the north of Italy to spot the disease was a sign of the times. A few decades earlier, they would have immediately noticed the tell-tale signs; it was later claimed that a small dose of quinine would have saved his life.\nAs there are still more than 1m deaths every year from malaria worldwide, Snowden's book also has contemporary relevance. This is a disease that affects every level of the societies where it is rampant. As Snowden writes: \"In Italy malaria undermined agricultural productivity, decimated the army, destroyed communities and left families impoverished.\" The economic miracle of the 50s and 60s which made Italy into a modern industrial nation would not have been possible without the eradication of malaria. Moreover, this book convincingly argues that the disease was \"an integral part of the big picture of modern Italian history\". This magnificent study, beautifully written and impeccably documented, deserves an audience beyond specialists in history, or in Italy. It also provides us with \"a message of hope for a world struggling with the great present-day medical emergency\".", "MURFREESBORO \u2013 MTSU English professor and folklorist Patricia Gaitely will lay hands on a controversial yet fascinating religious practice when she speaks Thursday, Nov. 20, in a free public lecture on campus.\n\"There's a Whole Lot of Snaking Going On: Folklore, Serpent-Handling and Appalachian Life\" is the topic of Gaitely's talk, set from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. Nov. 20 in the Tennessee Room inside MTSU's James Union Building.\nGaitely, an associate professor in the English department and a native of Great Britain, came to the United States to attend graduate school. She joined the MTSU faculty in 2006 and began a closer study of the predominantly Appalachian churches that use venomous snakes in their services to demonstrate the depth of members\u2019 faith.\n\u201cAs a Christian, I am very interested in how others of the same faith express that faith,\u201d Gaitely said in an interview published in the fall 2014 edition of MTSU\u2019s College of Liberal Arts magazine.\nSnake handling was first documented in East Tennessee in 1909, and the state banned the practice in 1947. The Tennessee Supreme Court ruled in 1975 that the practice was too dangerous to the public to be permitted in the name of freedom of religion. Recent cases involving ministers arrested for possessing venomous snakes, however, have been dismissed after grand juries refused to indict them.\nIn addition to her research on snake handling, Gaitely\u2019s folklore studies expertise has also led to publications, presentations and research on topics such as folklore in the fiction of James Lee Burke and the appearance of birds as harbingers of hope for grieving people.\nGaitely\u2019s lecture is presented by MTSU\u2019s College of Liberal Arts and the Department of English.

Families travelling from Tripoli to Bani Walid by car were also told to turn back.\n\u201cMovement to and from Bani Walid should not be arbitrarily constrained, and in particular all medical and other essential supplies should be allowed to reach the city without any impediments,\u201d Sahraoui added. Misratan thuwwar (\u201crevolutionaries,\u201d as anti-Gaddafi fighters are commonly known) and members of the Libya Shield 2 forces, Omran Shaaban and Mohamed Abdallah Ali were abducted around July 9 near Bani Walid.\nOmran Shaaban was freed on September 11 along with two other Misratans detained by armed militias in Bani Walid. When Amnesty International visited him in hospital in Misratah on September 12, he was paralyzed and in a coma. He was transferred to France for treatment, but succumbed to his gunshot wound on 24 September.\nTwo other Misratan detainees released along with Omran Shaaban were tortured, and at least four other Misratans are believed to be held by armed militias in Bani Walid. When Amnesty International visited Bani Walid on September 20, it was not able to locate their whereabouts and visit them, despite requests to the city\u2019s local leadership.\nOmaran Shaaban\u2019s death further exacerbated long-standing tensions between Misratah and Bani Walid.\n\u201cWhile securing the release of individuals detained unlawfully in Bani Walid is a positive step, the Libyan authorities also need to address the situation of the thousands of people held across Libya without charge or trial. The ongoing abductions of individuals without warrant by armed militias must end, and all unofficial detention facilities spread across the country must be closed,\u201d said Sahraoui.\nBani Walid was among the last cities to fall under the control of anti-Gaddafi forces during Libya\u2019s internal conflict last year.\nHundreds of residents from Bani Walid have been arrested by armed militias. Many have been tortured or otherwise ill-treated, and many continue to be detained without charge or trial across Libyan prisons and detention centers, including in Misratah.\nThe entrance of anti-Gaddafi forces into Bani Walid in October 2011 was accompanied by widespread looting and other abuses.\nEarlier this week, clashes in the eastern outskirts of Bani Walid led to the death of one man from Bani Walid and several injuries.", "Focus on Harvard sensation Jeremy Lin once again brought faith-talk and basketball analysis simultaneously together, this time via NBA legend Earvin Magic Johnson during ESPN/ABC's TV coverage of the New York Knicks' victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday.\nJohnson, who is rated the greatest NBA point guard of all time (ESPN 2007), now serves as a pro basketball commentator and analyst for the network. Although already a big fan of Lin, the Los Angeles Lakers' Hall of Famer said after the game there should be no question as to the legitimacy of the Knicks' point guard.\nDuring a game summary wrap-up between fellow analysts, including Jon Barry, Johnson said before commercial break, \"Like Jeremy Lin says, 'God is good.'\"\nJohnson tweeted after the game: \"There shouldn't be anymore questions as to whether @Jlin7 is legit so are the Knicks.\"\nEarlier in the week, a game-winning shot by Lin over the Toronto Raptors inspired Johnson to tweet: \"Everyone should be a believer in @Jlin7 after his shot to win the game tonight.\"\nAlthough Johnson does not talk about his faith often on television, his reference to God on Sunday is not a surprise to many in the Los Angeles area who have followed his career and life.\nIn 1991, at a press conference in Los Angeles, he announced that he had contracted HIV. His career with the Lakers came to a halt while he focused on treatment for the disease in which the medical field was still doing early research.\nJohnson says today that he has a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, according to the Christian publication Connection Magazine.\n\"I thank Him every chance I get \u2013 on my knees praying,\" said Johnson, as reported by Connection.\nJohnson, who leads the Magic Johnson Foundation, is a member of West Angeles Church of God in Christ. He was drawn to the church by his wife, Cookie, according to Connection.\nWhile displaying his patented Magic smile, he lavished praises on Lin during Sunday's broadcast in which Lin scored 28 points with 14 assists in the 104-97 win over the defending champion Mavs.\n\"What makes him for real is that he loves to compete,\" Johnson said. He explained to viewers that Lin plays unselfish ball and that other Knicks players, like Carmelo Anthony, who will be joining the starting rotation soon, need to adjust to the guard's game, not vice versa.\nLin's first eight starts in the NBA is remarkably comparable to the same number of first starting lineup assignments for some Hall of Fame point guards. Lin has 200 points and 76 assists in his starts, while Isiah Thomas had 184 points and 51 assists. Johnson scored 147 with 57 assists, and John Stockton had 80 points and 82 assists.\nAnalyst and former NBA player Jon Barry admitted that he was skeptical about Lin early on. However, things changed after the game on Sunday.\n\"I'm totally bought in now. The way he competes \u2026 the way he plays. The Knicks can't take him off the floor. He is big time. I'm all in on this guy, Jeremy Lin,\" Barry said.\nWho Is Jeremy Lin's Pastor?", "Gordon Seirup turned artistry into his own website development enterprise.\nQuestion: Explain what you do.\nAnswer: I own and manage a website development company, Copper Leaf Creative, creating custom websites for small- and medium-size businesses.\nA: I'm artistic. I never learned to paint, sculpt, or even draw very well. I first started dabbling in Adobe Photoshop in 2000 and applied those skills to working with websites the same year.\nI launched my first website as a freelancer for a paid client in 2001. I then fell out of the business, got a B.S. in psychology from Colorado State University, and found my way back to the industry in 2008 as an employee. I started Front Range Creative in 2008, which then grew into Copper Leaf Creative in 2011.\nQ: What are the biggest challenges you or your industry face?\nA: My biggest challenge is achieving the American Dream the hard way \u2014 actually bootstrapping a company by delivering a quality product and leveraging those proceeds to grow. We carry virtually no debt, and have no investors. We are growing organically, though the pace of that growth can be frustrating and very difficult.\nQ: What are the biggest rewards of your job?\nA: What I find most rewarding is the creative outlet. Not having learned any other artistic skill, building websites allows me to create, putting things out in the world. Secondarily, I love the social value of growing a team of creative individuals striving toward a common goal and having fun doing it. Finally, being recognized as an expert and valued asset is quite rewarding.\nQ: What advice do you have for someone else thinking about a career in your field?\nA: Web development is a big field all by itself \u2014 let alone the larger \"working with computers\" field. Find the aspect of development you love; become a ninja at that; do that; love what you do.\nA: I truly never had that much foresight. I never saw past 25 until I was 27.\nQ: Where do you see yourself career wise in 10 years?\nA: Owning three or four companies staffed by talented, passionate professionals, managed independently from each other and from me, and always looking for what I'd like to do next.\nQ: Outside of work, what's your favorite thing to do and your favorite place to do it?\nA: Socialize. Wherever the right people are is the right place to be.\nQ: What role does volunteerism/giving back play in your work or personal life?\nA: I grew up participating in myriad volunteer opportunities from Boy Scouts, to church-related missions. Over the last year, I have gotten more involved with the Mountain View Rotary Club. Also, Copper Leaf Creative donates web development and related services to a number of nonprofits.\nQ: What role does social media play in your business and how do you utilize it?\nA: Very little. I hop on Facebook a couple times per month, and usually with a specific purpose. Social media is ever-present professionally.\nA: My backyard. My wife and I bought a terribly neglected house with about 32 square feet of grass in the backyard. Now the backyard features a 600 square-foot patio and expansive grass. With the generous help of many friends, we built it all ourselves.\nSitting back there watching the world go by is very relaxing and rewarding.\nQ: What do you do in your leisure time?\nA: Sail, hike, camp, 4-wheel.\nQ: If you could interview one person in the world who would that be?", "At this stage, what would your message be to investors?\nWe believe that in India, growth as a strategy will tend to do exceptionally well over a longer period of time. So a high beta/alpha strategy portfolio will always deliver. We believe that our investment style will offer substantial alpha as and when confidence starts to come back and money starts chasing growth countries and growth stocks. If you look at the recovery period between 5 March and 4 June, and even the period following, JM schemes have done much better than the indices and even their peers. JM Basic Fund delivered 154% during that period and JM Emerging Fund delivered 135%. Our other equity schemes gave returns in the 70-150% range. During this same period, the Nifty returned 77% and the Sensex, 83%.\nWhat can your investors expect in future?\nWe feel that after a bit of consolidation, the market will move up and we may see 17,000 levels within the next six months. In the next two years, we expect the Sensex to rise above 25,000. Our schemes are well positioned to capture this kind of an up move.\nWhat disappointed the investors in your opinion?\n(The) majority of the money that we manage is in funds where the mandate is growth and the portfolio is more mid-cap oriented. So far, 2009 has been good for us and if our call on the market goes right, then our funds will deliver a very strong performance in the coming months and coming years. When the equity market was in a bullish phase in 2006-07, most of our mid-cap and large-cap schemes performed extremely well. They surpassed the indices by a huge margin. In 2007, the Sensex delivered 47% and the BSE Midcap index delivered 68%. Our flagship funds delivered returns in the 90-111% range. In fact, most of our schemes figured in the Top 50 Lipper world rankings.\nIn 2008, we witnessed the most severe fall in the history of the Indian stock market. The Sensex fell by 52% and the BSE Midcap index fell by 67%. Against that, our flagship funds fell by 65-75%.\nWhat were the reasons for your dismal performance?\nHad we taken a cash call, we would have performed better. But having said that, a 2008 kind of year comes only once in 50 years or so and, therefore, cannot become the basis for any change in our fund management style. We do not believe in taking aggressive cash calls and only in extreme conditions will we use cash as a strategy.\nAre you taking steps to ensure there is no undue exposure to illiquid stocks?\nAll the liquid names in 2007 became illiquid in 2008. And what happened took the entire market by surprise. But several measures have been put in place. We have strengthened our parameters on stock and sector concentration, and stop-loss limits. Our risk parameters now have multiple \u201cflag off\" levels that are more stringent than the regulatory requirements. We also have a more pragmatic approach towards risk management, with multiple checks and balances.", "The first Asian Games were held in 1951, the Pan American Games, also in 1951. From 1978, we have the Commonwealth Games, whose predecessors go all the way back to 1911. Europe has fallen drastically behind. Of course, if we look back, we should bear in mind the post-war destruction and the Iron Curtain division and political tensions Europe was facing for almost half of a century. At the same time, there is also a long period marked by the lack of resolve and cooperation between national and international governing bodies.\nBaku is a wonderful city, beautiful, possessing excellent facilities and infrastructure; its residents are passionate and interested in sports. Significant sports events experience and a superb organising team [also make it the perfect host city].\nMoldova will have around 85 athletes - it is the biggest team that our country has ever had. Representing athletics, canoe sprint, road cycling, judo, shooting, swimming, boxing, archery, taekwondo, fencing, sambo, and wrestling. Twelve sports in total.\nIt\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to develop spectator and athletes\u2019 interest and participation in the European Games. At the same time, it is an important element to consider when it comes to the programmes of the future editions.\nIf we think about the Pan American Games or Asian Games, Europe has almost 60 years of catching up to do. Continental events are landmark fixtures of the international sporting calendar and European Games would certainly occupy their rightful place. Europe is home to some of the most brilliant athletes and most ardent sport supporters in the world. Moreover, sport is an integral part of European culture. The European Games are a welcome opportunity to rekindle interest in sports on the continent, to promote the values it stands for, and to encourage and support sport development in European countries. It\u2019s an event with tremendous potential and Baku 2015 is an exciting new step into the future.\nWorld-class facilities and stellar professionalism of the LOC (Local Organising Committee) team leave us more than confident of Baku Games' potential to become one of the landmark sports events on many levels. Speaking of our impressions, of course, we should highlight the state-of-the-art venues and brilliantly planned infrastructure. The airport is really close to the city, while the Athletes' Village is walking distance away from the sports cluster. The organisation of the very first European Games is a tremendous responsibility; the LOC has done a wonderful job thus far. Sports director Pierce O\u2019Callaghan is a remarkable professional, who has worked as European Athletics' communications director for several years and who has been with Baku 2015 from the start. He served as one of the EOC\u2019s (European Olympic Committees) leading advisors on the inception of the European Games and was part of the Coordination Commission. Baku\u2019s director of press operations Jayne Pearce has served as head of press operations at the London  Olympic Games and many other major international sports events.\nWe would definitely like to see all Olympic sports.\nSuccessful European Games will elevate the image of Azerbaijan abroad; raising awareness about Baku as one of the most progressive, beautiful, culturally-rich cities of Europe. The European Games will play an important role in national sports, economic and social development of the country. Furthermore, it would be an important opportunity to test Baku\u2019s readiness to host the Olympic Games and prepare a future bid.\nMoldova has 10 medal hopefuls and quite a big delegation. Thus, we do have reason to expect the interest to be quite high. The European Games are a unique event, a first one, an important opportunity for our athletes. For some, Baku 2015 could serve as a chance to prove their potential and hopefully qualify for the Olympics, while for others it would be an occasion to experience a major sports event.\nParticipation in such a historic sports event is a once in a lifetime opportunity for many. It\u2019s a moment to make memories; a celebration of sport, of Olympic values and spirit. We are looking forward to being a part of this event to see outstanding sporting performances by Moldovan athletes and their European counterparts.", "For Jim Cramer, Thursday's big bank earnings reports could not be more important to this ailing market.\nFor over 36 years, the stock market has edged up, resulting in overall higher prices and an eight-year streak of bullish sentiment.\n\"But every big move, every move that had really any impact, always had the banks as one of the major leadership groups,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nBank stocks exploded after the election, but since March, weak employment numbers and the GOP's health care defeat dragged the big banks' shares down.\n\"Once people got their head[s] around the idea that the president's economic agenda was coming slower than we'd like ... I think that directly contributed to a decrease in lending,\" Cramer said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it hurts the banks tomorrow when they report.\"\nInterest rates also tanked, a signal that the economy was indeed slowing and that the Federal Reserve could hold off on raising rates again, a major headwind for bank earnings.\nSo reason No. 1 for a slumping market is the loss of bank stocks' leadership, an effect stemming from stasis in Washington and contingent on Thursday's earnings reports.\n\"What business can really make a plan for the future if it doesn't even know what health care is going to cost them, let alone repatriation and corporate taxes?\" Cramer asked.\nReason No. 2 is turmoil on the foreign policy front, a surefire path to putting the brakes on economic growth. Cramer said that while straining relations with Russia over Syria and with China over North Korea are significant issues, they are obstacles to President Donald Trump's pro-growth mission.\n\"Don't get me wrong. These are really important issues,\" Cramer said. \"[But] foreign policy seems to be trumping 'America First.'\"\nReason No. 3 is that stocks are pricey, which could obstruct future earnings reports, Cramer said.\n\"We may be on incredibly uncertain footing. Why? Because stocks are historically quite expensive, meaning if you compare where they stand versus how the companies are supposed to do, their price-to-earnings multiples, which is what we use to compare apples to apples, might be too high,\" he said.\nReason No. 4 reflects a rapidly changing domestic economy, even though overall global expansion can help U.S. multinationals even in a stateside slowdown.\n\"Brick-and-mortar retailers are being crushed by Amazon and the prospect of Paul Ryan's fascination with a regressive national sales tax on goods from overseas, which means pretty much everything that we buy at retail,\" Cramer said.\nReason No. 5? Autos. Cramer referenced a USA Today piece that lists the car industry's biggest hindrances, including a pileup of unsold cars, discounts wreaking havoc on companies' bottom lines, and loans getting longer even as production continues.\n\"Automobiles are a gigantic part of the economy. Looks like they've peaked,\" Cramer said.\nFinally, reason No. 6 is a case of oversupply in stocks. A deluge of IPOs is clogging this holiday-shortened week, and the market now has more sellers than buyers, which leads to widespread markdowns, now a daily practice.\nSo whether strong earnings reports from JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup or progress coming from Washington lift the market's spirits, this inflection point needs resolution.\n\"For the moment, we're at a level where things need to go very right for stocks to move higher, and those long odds make for a, yes, suboptimal start to earnings season,\" Cramer said.", "06-15-13 Mid-Summer Knights and Medieval Festival at Christ Episcopal Church in Warren, OH.\nDuring the Medieval foot combat battle, The Viking Traveler (left), Steven Baytos (persona name is Argh) from Cleveland, OH, strikes a lethal blow to the head of the Knight (right), Wade Casto (persona name is Beornmann) from Petersburg, OH.\nJenny Blazek (persona name is Lady Jendriska) , demostrating spinning wool into yarn.\nLaurel Gascoyne from Tonawanda, NY (persona name is Rhiannon Elandris) watches the parade around the grounds.\nDancers performing a Medieval dance for the crowd.\nPrior to the Medieval foot combat battle, The Viking Traveler (left), Steven Baytos (persona name is Argh) from Cleveland, OH, demostrates his weapons.\nPuss in Boots performed at the Queen's main tent.

And his keynote address at the 2012 ASCD Conference on Sunday was no exception.\nGawande began by explaining why he'd been chosen for the address. \"We have something really fundamental in common. As doctors and teachers, we are both privy to the secrets of people' lives,\" he said.\nWhen he began writing about his work as a doctor, he said, he became more and more intrigued by the question of \"how we all get good at what we do, and the difference between those who are merely competent and those who are great.\" One of the greatest challenges for those working in helping professions is recognize that their efficacy varies widely. \"There is a bell curve, a wide gap between the best [and worst] results,\" he said. \"Most of us are grouped in the mediocre middle.\"\nTo explore this gap, Gawande said he decided to research the bell curve within the treatment of cystic fibrosis\u0097a genetic disease with an average survival of 34 years. At the top of the curve\u0097in the best treatment facilities\u0097the average survival is 47 years or longer. \"I don't want to tell you what it's like at the other end of the curve,\" Gawande said.\nHe visited a hospital that receives some of the most severely stricken cystic fibrosis patients and yet is at the top of the curve\u0097the University of Minnesota Medical Center at Fairview. Gawande shadowed the director of the cystic fibrosis program there, Dr. Warren Warwick, and watched as he checked in with a 17-year-old patient whose health had diminished over the last three months. With curiosity, not judgment, the doctor asked the girl a series of detailed questions about what was going on in her life. The girl finally admitted she had a new job, a new boyfriend, and had completely gone off her treatment. Warwick turned to Gawande and said, \"You see, cystic fibrosis patients are interesting patients because they are good scientists.\"\nDr. Warkwick then put on his teaching hat and worked out some numbers for the girl. He explained that if she didn't take her medicine on any given day, she had a .5 percent chance of getting a lung infection. If she did take her medication the risk was .05 percent. While she was almost 100 percent sure to be well on any given day even if she didn't take her medicine, her chance of making it through an entire year without a bad infection was 17 percent. If she took the medicine, the chance went up to 83 percent.\nThe doctor then helped the teenager unpack the reasons she was not taking her medicine, and the two came up with a plan to overcome each of those obstacles. He even went so far as to call the patient's best friend to tell her the plan and enlist her help.\nAccording to Gawande, three traits in particular make that doctor\u0097and the others at his hospital\u0097great at what he does: diligence, recognition of failure, and attention to detail.\n\"Excellence is not the difference between bad and good,\" he said. \"It's the difference between good and great. It's the difference everyday between 99.5 percent success and 99.95 percent success.\"\nGawande went on to discuss the need for coaching and collaborative teamwork, both of which have even more overt applications to both teaching and medicine. But, as I see it, educators could find enough lessons in just in that one story alone for a school year's worth of PD.\nWhat are your thoughts? What can educators learn from how Warwick treats cystic fibrosis patients? How can teachers use similar methods as Warwick? And on the flip side, is there any danger in substituting value-added scores for cystic fibrosis survival rates? With the medical model in mind, how can we determine which teachers are at the top of the bell curve?", "\"Beto O\u2019Rourke leads Ted Cruz by 2 among likely voters in U.S. Senate race, new poll finds\" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans \u2014 and engages with them \u2014 about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.\nBeto O\u2019Rourke leads Ted Cruz by 2 among likely voters in U.S. Senate race, new poll finds By Kathryn Lundstrom September 19, 2018 Editor's note: This story has been updated to emphasize the Ipsos poll's findings among likely voters. *Correction appended. U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, D-El Paso, leads Republican incumbent Ted Cruz by 2 percentage points among likely voters, according to an Ipsos online poll released Wednesday in conjunction with Reuters and the University of Virginia. O\u2019Rourke has been closing the gap over the last several months, but this is the first poll that puts him ahead of Cruz. Forty-seven percent of likely voters told Reuters they would vote for O'Rourke, while 45 percent said they would cast their ballot for Cruz. Three percent said they would vote for \"Other,\" and 5 percent said \"None.\" Ipsos online polls do not have margins of error; instead, the poll's precision is measured using a \"credibility interval.\" This poll's credibility interval was +/-3.5 percentage points among likely voters. A Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday put Cruz 9 percentage points ahead of O\u2019Rourke among likely voters. That poll was based on phone interviews, while the Ipsos poll used an online survey. But it\u2019s trying to predict who will show up on Election Day that shifts the numbers, said Ipsos Vice President Chris Jackson. Ipsos is trying to gauge political enthusiasm on each side, said Jackson. The poll asked respondents to estimate the likelihood that they\u2019d vote in the midterm elections on a scale from one to 10. \u201cMore Democrats are registering at the highest part of the scale, at the 10, than the Republicans,\u201d Jackson said. And that\u2019s what\u2019s interesting, he said, because Republicans usually have the momentum advantage in Texas. \u201cIt demonstrates how Democrats are mobilized,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cThis election is going to be really competitive and its going be very hard fought.\u201d Healthcare and immigration were the issues that Texas voters valued most, according to the poll, but it\u2019s \u201cvery lopsided,\u201d Jackson said. Republican respondents cared most about immigration and Democrats cared most about healthcare with very little overlap. Respondents were also asked whether they perceived Cruz and O\u2019Rourke as \u201ctraditional\u201d politicians. Among likely voters, 76 percent saw Cruz as traditional, while only 32 percent perceived O\u2019Rourke that way \u2014 something that may be to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s advantage in a political climate that leans away from establishment politics, Jackson said. The poll also questioned voters about the Texas gubernatorial election and found that Gov. Greg Abbott leads his Democratic challenger, Lupe Valdez, by 9 percentage points among likely voters.

A woman in Tempe, Arizona, was struck and killed in an accident involving an Uber self-driving car.\nIn what is believed to be the first death of a pedestrian hit by a self-driving car on a public street, a woman in Tempe, Arizona, was killed in an accident involving an Uber autonomous vehicle Sunday night.\nUber confirmed the accident occurred, and that there was a person in a front passenger seat acting as operator of the vehicle. Uber said that as a result of the accident, it is putting a hold on all tests involving its self-driving cars. In addition to Arizona, the ride-sharing company has been running tests of self-driving cars in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Toronto.\nUber said it has more than 200 self-driving cars as part of its autonomous vehicle testing program.\n\u201cOur hearts go out to the victim\u2019s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\u201d said an Uber spokesperson, in a statement provided to this news organization.\nElaine Herzberg, 49, was struck as she walked from west to east outside of a crosswalk Sunday night, according to Tempe police. Herzberg was then transported to a local hospital, where she died. Police say the incident was still part of an active investigation, and that Uber is assisting with the matter.\nJohn Simpson, privacy and technology project director at the nonpartisan group Consumer Watchdog, which has been critical of rapid growth of the self-driving car technology industry, said the fatality \u201cunderscores the difficulty robot cars have in interacting with pedestrians and cyclists.\u201d He called for an immediate national moratorium on the testing of self-driving cars on public roads until an independent analysis of what caused the accident can be completed.\nThe incident comes at a particularly embarrassing time for Uber; California is set to allow self-driving cars without any human support behind the wheel for testing and transporting people on public roads beginning April. 2.\nWhen reached for comment on the Uber accident, the California Department of Motor Vehicles didn\u2019t say if it would postpone that April 2 date.\nTim Bajarin, president of tech consultancy Creative Strategies, said Sunday\u2019s fatality shows that the technology behind autonomous vehicles is \u201cby no means ready for prime time,\u201d despite all the attention and investment being given to it.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board said it is sending a team of four investigators to Tempe to look into the factors surrounding the accident.\nTempe police said the woman was crossing Mill Avenue outside of a crosswalk just south of Curry Road when she was struck by a northbound car.

They decided to announce this gift publicly, she said, to ''raise everyone's sights'' as the campaign begins.\nLulu Wang is the founder of Tupelo Capital Management, a name chosen tongue-in-cheek with reference to one of Wellesley's more girlish traditions. School legend has it that women must walk their ''young men'' around the school's large lake three times. If by the third loop he has not proposed marriage, she is allowed -- and encouraged -- to push him into the lake at the point on the shore where the tupelo tree stands.\nMrs. Wang has been a member of Wellesley's board of trustees since 1988, and is the first woman to head the board's investment committee, which is in charge of investing the college's endowment, valued at about $1 billion. She also heads the finance committee of the New York Community Trust and serves on a number of other boards in New York, including the Rockefeller Family Fund, WNYC and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nAnthony Wang, a Yale alumnus, retired in 1992 as president and chief operating officer of Computer Associates International, a software company.", "The measure, which now goes to President Trump for his signature, dismisses an Obama-era rule banning states from denying federal funds to such organizations.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Pence cast a tie-breaking Senate vote Thursday to pass legislation that will allow states to withhold federal funds from Planned Parenthood and other health care providers that perform abortions.\nPence's vote was needed to break a 50-50 tie. Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska broke with their party, voting against the measure.\nRepublicans have said the Obama rule should be overturned to allow states the right to steer funds away from abortion providers, if they choose.\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said the measure reverses a rule that \"attempted to empower federal bureaucrats in Washington and silence our states.\"\nDemocrats condemned the measure throughout the day, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York calling it \"another example of the Republican war on women.\"\n\"It would let states treat women as second-class citizens who don\u2019t deserve the same access to health care as men,\" he said.\nThe House in February had voted 230-188 largely along party lines to reject the rule under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn recently enacted regulations.\nThe rule prohibits states from withholding family-planning funding from providers for reasons other than their ability to offer family-planning services. It took effect Jan. 18, two days before President Obama left office.\nSince 2011, 13 states have restricted access to such grants, disrupting or reducing services in several instances.\nWomen\u2019s marches across the country have protested cuts to reproductive health care services.\nPence, an evangelical Christian, was a leader in efforts to defund Planned Parenthood while serving in Congress and he co-sponsored \u201cpersonhood\u201d legislation calling for constitutional rights at the moment of fertilization.

If you visit, it's not hard to see why: the Riverwalk is lined with exciting shops, bars and restaurants, and it provides tourists with easy access to attractions and historical sites in the heart of the state's second-largest city. There are also tons of fun festivals and celebrations that occur here throughout the year, so be sure to check the events calendar before your visit.\nOne of the most popular activities to do on the Riverwalk, especially for first-time visitors, is a boat tour. You can elect to do a dinner or cocktail cruise by contacting the Riverwalk restaurant of your choice; they'll help you charter the boat and cater the meal. This is a great way to see the Riverwalk if you have a group of 10 or more. Alternately, you could opt to do a narrated tour of the Riverwalk with Go Rio Cruises. These engaging, history-heavy tours are offered daily, from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. They leave every 15 minutes, and you can purchase tickets at one of the three main kiosks located along the Riverwalk. Other boat tours include the Museum Reach, which is an additional 1.3 miles of Riverwalk added in 2009. This section offers views of several public art installations, including the famed Grotto, a cave structure by the artist Carlos Cortes. Apart from boat tours, there are plenty of shopping and eating opportunities to keep you busy.\nThere's a little something for everyone when it comes to restaurants along the Riverwalk. If you're hankering for some Tex-Mex, head to Acenar, a contemporary Mexican restaurant and bar with a great view of the river. To satisfy a craving for Mediterranean-style food, Bella on the River is your best bet. And Las Ramblas, located inside the Hotel Contessa, serves the most delicious Spanish cuisine and cocktails. Just don't be surprised if you see a wedding on Marriage Island, a nearby inlet where couples go to get hitched. Finally, if you're feeling thirsty, pay a visit to Esquire Tavern, the oldest and most charming bar on the Riverwalk.\nThroughout the year, there are often special events and celebrations held along the Riverwalk. During the Christmas season, for example, the area becomes a wonderland aglow in twinkly lights. The atmosphere is pure magic. There are also frequent concerts and festivals happening during every major holiday of the year. Check out the Riverwalk events calendar for information on upcoming events, performances and celebrations.\nHarrington, Justine. \"San Antonio Riverwalk.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/san-antonio-riverwalk-12042.html. 15 March 2018.", "Connie Nguyen, co-owner of the Pho Thien Vietnamese Kitchen in Naperville, is following in the footsteps of her grandmother and mother, both of whom once owned restaurants.\nThis week, we speak with Connie Nguyen, 35, co-owner of Pho Thien Vietnamese Kitchen at 931 W 75th St. Nguyen operates the family restaurant with her sister and brother and continues a tradition forged by her grandmother in Vietnam, who ran a small restaurant in front of her home, and her mother, who once operated two restaurants in California.\nQuestion: It sounds like cooking has been a longtime tradition in your family?\nNguyen: My mom, my aunt, my sisters \u2013 there are five sisters \u2013 we all cooked growing up. We moved here from Vietnam in 1991, and moved then to Illinois three years ago. We came initially to open a nail salon, but the market was too competitive. I was thinking what other business can we do? So, I thought we'd open a Vietnamese restaurant since there aren't a lot around here.\nQuestion: You say there was a lot of competition in the nail salon, but there are a couple hundred restaurants here in Naperville, which makes it a competitive business as well. Why did you think it would succeed?\nNguyen: We know how to run a restaurant. Vietnamese food is very easy to eat. It's not strong in spices like other ethnic food. It would be different if we opened one of those types of restaurants, like a hamburger shop. We only do what we know well.\nQuestion: Tell us about your typical customers. I assume a lot of them are not Vietnamese.\nNguyen: We have a lot of diversity here. We don't have a lot of Vietnamese on the week days, just the weekend only. We have a lot of Mexican, Indian, Korean, Chinese and a lot of whites.\nQuestion: For people not familiar with Vietnamese food, what would you say are some of the key ingredients?\nNguyen: Fish sauce is the number one thing, plus onions, garlic, lemon grass, and the common sugar and salt.\nQuestion: How does Vietnamese food differ from Thai food, or are they sort of cousins?\nNguyen: The biggest difference, I think, is Thai has a lot of coconut milk.\nQuestion: What are some things you like to make at home?\nNguyen: We eat a lot of vegetable greens and herbs, so something that has those things in there. I would make a stir fry beef or any kind of meat or a chicken to go with them.\nQuestion: What's the most important protein used in Vietnamese cooking?\nNguyen: Pork. It's more affordable.\nQuestion: When you go out to eat, what's your favorite thing \u2013 appetizer, entr\u00e9e or dessert?\nQuestion: So you're not one of those women who says, 'Let's get to dessert first,' and go from there?\nNguyen: When I'm hungry, I just want to go straight to the main dish.\nQuestion: Other than Vietnamese food, what are your next top three cuisines?\nNguyen: Korean, Japanese and then Mexican.\nQuestion: Most people put Italian on the list, but it's not on yours. Why not?\nNguyen: I think because our ingredients are very different. We don't have cheese and cream and those ingredients. It's too foreign to my palate.\nQuestion: What's the best thing you've ever eaten in your life?\nNguyen: It would be when we have the whole family together and have something like bun bo hue. It's a soup made out of pork bone, and it has lemon grass in it with vermicelli noodles and topped with pork meat and pork shanks and pork knuckle. It sounds scary but it's good.\nQuestion: Every culture has a number of poverty-driven foods. What's yours?\nNguyen: Porridge. Rice just made with water and salt that's blown up more. Poor people wouldn't have fish sauce.\nQuestion: What's your favorite American junk food?\nNguyen: I like Portillo's hot dogs.\nQuestion: I'm sure all of your dishes are family-based recipes. What dish are you featuring for us?\nNguyen: Pho is the dish. It consists of beef bone; we cook the broth here for 17 hours. We use ginger, star anise, cilantro seed, onions and also fish sauce and sugar and salt. We serve it with sticky texture rice noodles and top it off with different beef cuts, such as beef shank, thinly sliced steak and meatballs. This is a beef soup.\nQuestion: How popular is this?\nQuestion: Have you changed the recipe at all?\nNguyen: It's been altered a little bit. We listen to our customers to try to modernize things if they want it a little different spice wise.", "DALTON \u2014 Lisa Followay, executive director of the Adaptive Sports Program of Ohio, Dalton, was awarded the KIDCHAMP distinction from Rite Aid on Monday for all that she has accomplished in providing youth competitive sports opportunities.\nFolloway is only \"the fourth person in the history of the company\" to be presented with the relatively new award, said Scott Bernard, senior vice president of stores, during the presentation at ASPO's headquarters on Kurzen Road in Dalton.\nASPO is a nonprofit organization promoting health and wellness for youth with physical disabilities through competitive and recreational adaptive sport opportunities across Ohio.\nThe ceremony was attended by several honored guests, including Rep Scott Wiggam and Wooster High School's athletic director Andy Kellar, along with \"our athletes and some of the athletes' families,\" said Danielle McCoy, chief development officer for ASPO.\nAccompanying Followay's award was a $10,000 donation to ASPO and $500 in Rite Aid gift cards.\n\"(Followay) literally has changed the game for people with disabilities,\" Bernard said, noting \"the prestigious honor\" is designated for people in Rite Aid's communities who are making a significant different in the lives of youth, while \"advocating for their health and well being, championing education and academic growth and creating a safe environment for children and teens to live and grow.\"\nHaving dedicated her life to ASPO's mission, Bernard said, Followay wanted to \"change the game\u201d not only for her own son, Casey, but for all youth with disabilities. For her, it is \"more than a career. It's a passion.\"\n\"What an inspiration,\" said Bernard of Casey, who was the wheelchair winner in the half marathon in the Columbus Marathon on Oct. 20.\nOver the last two biennium budgets, ASPO has received some state funding, Wiggam said, to expand efforts into additional school districts.\n\"We are looking for programs that change lives \u2026 that's what (ASPO) is doing,\" Wiggam said, citing benefits from student participation in sports, including doing better academically and developing \"more aspirations for the future.\"\n\"We see this as a great partnership,\" Wiggam said.\nCurrently, said Bernard, ASPO is the largest adaptive sport organization in Ohio, encompassing \"more than 300 individuals in six cities through 10 sports, including basketball, sled hockey and track.\"\n\"This whole vision is hers,\" said ASPO board member Jeff Tomassetti, referring to Followay.\nTomassetti clarified the programs sponsored by ASPO are more than recreational.\n\"(These youth) are athletes,\" he said, having been given the opportunity to compete.\nWarren Craig praised ASPO for what it has given him.\nAs a young child, he said, he was able to adapt, with the help of his parents, to play soccer and baseball; but as he grew, the level of competition increased and participation became unsafe for him.\n\"That left a void in my life,\" said Craig, now 31, which existed until he was 22 years old and became involved with ASPO.\nHad it not been for ASPO, \"I probably would never have picked up a basketball,\" said Wooster High School junior Evan Heller. \"It opened up so many pathways and doorways.\n\"I hope to play wheelchair basketball in college,\" said Heller, who is a 2018 All Ohioan Wheelchair Track State Runner for the Wooster Generals.\nThe Wooster Generals team also earned the distinction of winning the inaugural Ohio Interscholastic Wheelchair Basketball State Championship in 2018.\n\"It's a great feeling to watch these kids compete,\" said Kellar, adding he was \"proud to be part of the original solution\" in the Wooster City Schools District\u2019s partnership with ASPO.\nFollowing the ceremony, ASPO athletes and Rite Aid company representatives attending the event engaged in a game of wheelchair basketball.", "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 The father and the fiance of an Australian woman shot to death by a Minneapolis police officer responding to her 911 call grieved at a public memorial service Friday night, the same time the family had planned to be on a plane to her wedding.\nJustine Damond's father, John Ruszczyk, choked back tears as he vowed to find justice for his 40-year-old daughter, whom he described as being \"ripped from our arms.\"\n\"We should be walking down the street smiling and laughing,\" he said of his first visit to Minneapolis. \"But now every step on the foot path is very painful. I feel crushed by sorrow.\"\nHundreds of people, many wearing heart-shaped stickers, attended the memorial service. An Australian flag was displayed prominently on the stage next to Damond's picture.\nHer fiance, Don Damond, said it \"felt like a privilege to love Justine.\" They were getting married next week in Hawaii, and he pointed out the painful irony that the service \u2014 held at a lakefront stage near her home in southwest Minneapolis \u2014 coincided with the family's original travel plans.\nHe read some of the uplifting messages she would free-write every morning and called her a \"living example of self-mastery.\"\n\"I have immense gratitude for being the one she chose,\" Don Damond said. \"In Australia, they call it 'you're punching above your weight.' I really had to step up to be at her level.\"\nHer family has set up the Justine Damond Social Justice Fund, which will support causes important to her, including those promoting equal treatment for all.\nAs Damond's loved ones mourned their loss, the investigation into her death moved forward. A judge approved a search warrant for investigators to examine the smartphones of two Minneapolis police officers in the shooting.\nThe search warrant application was filed Thursday by an agent with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The agent requested permission to download data from the iPhones issued by the Minneapolis Police Department.\nThe application states that the information \"may more clearly define\" the officers' actions before and after she was killed on July 15. Investigators have said Officer Mohamed Noor shot the 40-year-old woman after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault near her home.\nNoor's partner, Officer Matthew Harrity, told investigators a noise startled him just before Damond approached their police SUV. Noor was in the passenger seat and shot Damond through the open driver-side window. Noor has declined to be interviewed by investigators and cannot be compelled to do so.\nThe two officers had not activated their body cameras. Minneapolis police officers are now required to have those cameras on when they respond to calls or make traffic stops.\nDamond's death led to a shake-up at the top of the Minneapolis Police Department. Police Chief Janee Harteau resigned at the request of Mayor Betsy Hodges, who said the department needed new leadership. Hodges nominated Medaria Arradondo, who had been assistant chief, to become chief.\nThis week a Minneapolis City Council committee unanimously endorsed Arradondo's nomination.", "Members of the Notre Dame community gathered Thursday evening at Browning Cinema in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center for a panel discussion about the upcoming pro-life film \u201cUnplanned\u201d hosted by the de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture.\nThe panel, whose discussion was partly based on clips from the film shown to the audience, was moderated by O. Carter Snead, the director of the Center for Ethics and Culture. The panel\u2019s four members included Abby Johnson, whose life is the subject of the film, Mary FioRito, a pro-life activist and fellow at the de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture, Chuck Konzelman, a Notre Dame alumnus from the class of 1982 who co-wrote and co-directed the film, and Cary Solomon, Konzelman\u2019s fellow co-writer and co-director.\n\u201cUnplanned,\u201d which comes out March 29, is based on Johnson\u2019s memoir of the same name. The story follows Johnson\u2019s journey from a clinic manager for Planned Parenthood to an outspoken advocate for the pro-life movement following a life-changing experience she had while assisting with an ultrasound abortion.\nIn an interview prior to the event, Konzelman said he and Solomon became aware of Johnson\u2019s story after being approached in a coffee shop by a stranger who recommended they read her memoir.\nKonzelman and Solomon said they made a conscious decision to make the film as factual as possible. For them, this meant not only including an accurate portrayal of the abortion process, but also of those who work at Planned Parenthood clinics. Solomon said it would have been counter-productive and dishonest to paint Planned Parenthood employees in an evil light. Instead, they emphasized the humanity and honest intentions of all involved.\nThese portrayals make the film an especially valuable contribution to the national conversation on abortion, Johnson said.\nKonzelman said he and Solomon felt called to share Johnson\u2019s story of conversion with audiences on the big screen.\nThe movie was produced with an eye towards performing the work of God, Solomon said.\nBecause abortion has become \u201cthe third rail of American politics,\u201d Konzelman said they have struggled to convince major outlets to advertise the film\u2019s release.\nRegardless of any difficulties with media attention, Johnson said the honesty of \u201cUnplanned\u201d will have a lasting influence on the very nature of the abortion debate in America.", "Encouragement for Jon McLaughlin after his penalty save, and for Tom Flanagan, whose tackle had definitively ended the danger.\nThat set the tone for the 20 minutes that followed.\nCattermole was the talismanic figure as Sunderland defended resolutely, the 30-year-old popping up everywhere and making countless vital interceptions.\nAt the end his name was roared in the away end.\nThere were salutes from the midfielder both for those fans and his team-mates.\nHe may not have the armband but his influence is clear. Cattermole was delighted with the resilience, but has warned his team to be more ruthless in the coming weeks and months.\n\"We're making things so hard for ourselves,\" he said.\n\"Any time there's a dull moment in the game, we give a team an opportunity to get a foothold. We were so comfortable in the first half, we need to be more ruthless, get more used to winning games.\n\"It was the same on Tuesday, we dominated but you've got to go 2, 3-0 up. But we're learning as a group, the staff are picking out things for us and we're improving the performances. We dug in there and I don't think we were ever going to get beat. Our response to the Burton defeat, as a group, has been excellent.\n\"Fair play to the manager, he made that little change, brought Alim on. They were playing a lot of long balls so it made sense to do that, he was ready, as were George and Dylan. it'll take the full squad for us to succeed this season. The resilience is there for everyone to see.\"\nCattermole's future was the subject of intense speculation and he admits that when relegation from the Championship was confirmed, he expected to move on.\nThere was rumoured interest from Hull City and Stoke City also offered a late escape route as Gary Rowett looked to plot a path back to the Premier League.\nIn pre-season there were difficult moments and Cattermole told Jack Ross not to pick him if he felt it could adversely affect younger players on the pitch.\nNow, however, he is loving life as part of what he sees as exactly the kind of squad Sunderland should always build.\nHe is determined to help them put the club back where it belongs.\n\"For me, I fought relegation from the Premier League for twelve years, going home devastated on a night because you're losing games. Digging in, it is a lot of effort.\n\"The difference in me because we're winning, it doesn't matter what league it is in. It's a good thing to be part of. It's nice to be part of it this but we've not done anything yet.\n\"We've got a lot of players in this squad who believe, they're players who want to prove themselves and we know we have to work hard to get there.\n\"I think the manager and his staff have created that environment for us. We've seen there's players who don't want to be part of it, I can't understand it. Why wouldn't you? The manager is putting on such good sessions, we're learning and improving every week.\n\"I've been through that much but as long as you go to work each day and give your all, I can look in the mirror and sleep at night. I'll try and do the talking on the pitch, and you see the response from the fans there.\n\"I could have left the club in different circumstances but I decided I wanted to stay, I didn't want to go out on such a bad note after nine years,\" he added.\n\"I was always determined to play well, we had a good pre-season, the staff and the players we have brought in have been different class. The lads we have brought in are what we've needed as a club. Some of the signings we made [in the past], never Sunderland players, never what the fans demand.\n\"Look at the end of there, three or four lads, 96th minute, ratting about people, that's what this club is about. We'll get better and keep going.\n\"I didn't think we'd drop out of the Premier League after all those survivals we had. It hurts you as a player when you're giving everything on the pitch and then you're seeing some of the recruitment over the years, you get some stick sometimes and you look at how many players have come here and not made any impact on the club.\n\"I'm proud of what I've done here, I'll keep doing what I do. The change of ownership, it feels like a new club and the fans seem happy.\"\nThere is no doubt who Cattermole sees as a key architect in Sunderland's revival this season.\nHis praise for Jack Ross is effusive, honest and passionate.\nThat the feeling is mutual is no secret.\n\"Last year as a club we were nowhere near where we should have been, and it was horrible. At first I felt I needed a change but the staff who came in had a very similar idea about football to me, and the longer it went on the more I wanted to stay.\n\"I just felt chatting to Jack that he really cared, understood my situation. I felt I could learn from him, how he wants to play, you see times in games, some of the football we play is great.\n\"That's even with so many new many players. I like his principles, what he wants from his team. We're all good players but you only get to see it when you put the hard yards in.\n\"The manager has been different class from day one, driving it, first out there to set the sessions up. He leaves no stone unturned, there's absolutely no excuses [for players] because he's so professional.\n\"For me, it's all about what's going forward now. If I think about the past it's just going to drag me down, I think about what I'm doing every day for the club, for Jack Ross and for the other lads.\"\nAt Valley Parade there was almost a fourth goal of the campaign for Cattermole.\nHe was, however, more than happy to see Josh Maja ultimately claim his ninth of the season.\n\"It was going wide to be fair,\" he admitted.\n\"I was going to wind him up and say that they'd given it to me! I'm buzzing for Maj though. I can't believe he's only 19, it seems like he's been around for a while now.\n\"He's a cracking player. Some of his mates moved on but he's hung around and he's doing great. We're going to need all the lads this season.\"\nFor Jack Ross, communication has been key and the pair are now reaping the rewards.\n\"He's been great for me from day one \u2013 how he's trained, how he's gone about things,\" Ross said.\n\"Always we've been very open in our communication and I understood the situation he was in and a lot about the wrong perception of him so he and I built a relationship based on how we found each other and he's been really good for me off the pitch and on the pitch and he's enjoying his football \u2013 you can see it from his performances, how he trains every day and how he speaks to me and the staff. I'm pleased for him.\"\n\u201cI'm pleased he's enjoying the adulation he's getting from supporters because he's had difficult times and he loves playing football, loves the club and wants to take the club back up the levels. I think that was epitomized in the last 20 minutes on Saturday. His desire to make sure he won that game was outstanding.\"", "So the name that was given to me in my spiritual seeking was Jarl Aslaung Thoreskelde, when translated means something like Chieftain Woman Betrothed to the God Beloved of Thor.

There is one thing that you can always expect from Loki, he is an a-hole and he will always be an a-hole. If you want to deal with him in any kind of manner where he doesn\u2019t completely screw up your life at every step that you take, well here\u2019s how.\nYou pay attention. You honestly don\u2019t have another choice. When Loki is in your life ignoring him will make you go spiraling into deep dark abyss quicker than you can think of because he is trying to help you so you need to accept his help or it\u2019s going to go the opposite direction. These are the terms and conditions that you need to accept when you work with Loki.\nThis I think is where Loki tends to get a bad rap with most people that follow the Northern Path, and most pagans in general. He has three aspects to him depending on his stages in life. You have the completely trickster Loki that is going to do everything to please himself, and for the sheer joy of doing things. This is a Loki you hear about less frequently because he\u2019s not around for very long. This is when he first becomes a blood brother to Odin and in order to get the others to like him he plays pranks.\n\u201cLoki and Sva\u00f0ilfari\u201d by Dorothy Hardy. From WIkiMedia.\nSpoiler Alert, no one on Asgard liked these pranks, and all he got for it was an eight legged horse that calls him Mom. Which is where you start getting into what I like to call the middle of the road Loki where he causes trouble only to fix it and try to be seen as the savior. Tom Hiddleston plays an excellent middle path Loki (though his hair should be red!) he angers everyone, tries to fix it, and in the end hilarity ensues. While a lot of the facts are inaccurate in the Marvel Universe and those Movies, the character behind that Loki makes him a perfect example of the Middle Path Loki Attitude.\nFlash forward a little while in his life. If you don\u2019t know by now, Frigga becomes troubled by dreams of her beloved son Balder dying. So she of course extracts promises from everyone to not kill him except for the mistletoe because it was too young. Loki convinces Balder\u2019s blind brother to throw a dart of mistletoe at him, killing him. Basically after that it is all downhill for Loki in the lore. The gods betray him, they bind him to rock with his son\u2019s intestines, and have a very venomous snake over his head dripping poison into his eyes. At this point who wouldn\u2019t be pissed?\nLoki switches teams, will eventually break free, and ride in on a ship of nails leading the army of giants. Then everyone dies. This last incarnation is destroyer of worlds, and he will destroy everything you know and love to set off your own personal Ragnarok.\nMy point being, know which Loki you are working with, pay attention to what he is trying to do, and plan for when things go wrong. You don\u2019t have to become the Chaos in order to embrace it and you don\u2019t have to fear Loki being in your life. You can just ride the wave and let things happen, Loki is a bad guy but he\u2019s not really the bad guy. Loki is the one that you will fear the least when you understand him.", "EAGLE \u2014 When local kids head back to their classrooms this fall, a new mental health support system is being mobilized on their behalf.\nOn Tuesday, Aug. 21, the Eagle County commissioners allocated $400,000 from the 1A marijuana tax proposals that passed last fall to fund four new school-based counselors \u2014 three for the buildings in the Eagle River Valley and one for the Roaring Fork Valley School District. The proposal marks the first recommendation from the county\u2019s Mental Health Advisory Committee.\nIn presenting the proposal, Eagle County Health Promotion Coordinator Mandy Ivanov noted it received the unanimous support of the mental health committee members. She noted during every meeting of the advisory committee and the Total Health Alliance \u2014 a local group that is open to anyone interested in improving the mental health system in Eagle County \u2014 school-based counselors were identified as a top priority. What\u2019s more, she noted that officials with MindSprings Health, Vail Health, Eagle County Health Services District and Mountain Family Health Centers also support the effort.\nIvanov pointed to the recently released Healthy Kids Colorado Survey, which showed that nearly one-third of local middle and high school students report feeling seriously depressed. Those results have trended upward over the past four years.\n\u201cWe wanted to address this as soon as possible,\u201d Ivanov said.\nShe added that officials from Eagle County Schools, St. Clare of Assisi, Stone Creek Charter School, Vail Christian Academy, Vail Christian High School, Vail Mountain School, Basalt High School and Roaring Fork School District recently gathered to discuss the mental health needs of local kids.\nIvanov noted that at that meeting, the school-based counselors proposal was formulated. The idea is to provide all kids with access to professional counseling, regardless of where they attend classes.\nIn February, 2018 the death by suicide by a local teen stunned the Eagle Valley community. Read how a Colorado survey reinforces need for youth mental health services in Eagle County.\n\u201cSometimes people think people in our valley and the Roaring Fork Valley have it made,\u201d said Michael Holton, vice president of marketing and communications for Vail Health.\nHolton said providing school-based mental health counselors is a wise investment for 1A money. Rob Stein, superintendent of Roaring Fork School District, echoed that assertion.\nStein noted that during the fall of the 2016-17 school year, Glenwood Springs High School reported nine cases of student mental health holds. The school then brought a mental health counselor on board and in the spring semester reported only one mental health hold case.\nAs local schools institute the counseling program, the mental health committee has proposed a sliding funding formula. This year, the county\u2019s mental health marijuana tax revenues would provide $320,000 \u2014 $400,000 for Eagle River Valley schools and $80,000 for Roaring Fork Valley schools. That number will decrease by $100,000 for the next two years, and then it will drop to an estimated $120,000 \u2014 $140,000 total for Eagle River Valley schools and $20,000 for Roaring Fork Valley schools \u2014 in year four.\nIn approving the $400,000 expenditure from the county\u2019s Mental Health Fund, commissioners heard from committee members and other partners who indicated the need school-based counselors.\nOn the topic of funding, this year the county has allocated an additional $500,000 for mental health needs with the money coming from the public health reserve fund. The 1A measure has collected approximately $197,000. That means there is roughly $700,000 currently available for mental health initiatives.\nEagle County Public Health Director Chris Lindley said because the funding mechanism is new, the county is being conservative with its program funding estimates.\n\u201cSchool-based mental health counselors was a huge gap in the system,\u201d Commissioner Jill Ryan said. She urged the mental health committee to strategically identify other needs that can be shored up with county funding.\n\u201cI look at 1A funding as anchor funding,\u201d Ryan said.\nCommissioner Jeanne McQueeney praised the various local agencies that are working to help address the county\u2019s mental health needs. She noted it is a fallacy to think that the mental health situation in Eagle County is a new crisis. Rather, McQueeney said it is an old problem that people are finally discussing.", "Over at Techland, I\u2019ve reviewed the iPhone 4S. Executive summary: It\u2019s not the one right phone for everybody, but I do think it\u2019s the single best smartphone on the market, in part because of the features it offers, but just as much because Apple\u2019s level of polish and efficiency beats Android so handily, and because the App Store is such a huge asset.\nAs the 4S\u2019s very name tells you, it\u2019s not a big advance on the 4. But the faster processor is noticeable and welcome, the camera is much better, and Siri is both useful and fascinating.\nOne question I touched on in the review but want to write about at greater length soon: Is the 4S\u2019s small screen compared to Android and Windows phone handsets a pro, a con, or something else? I\u2019m still figuring out my take on that, and am curious what you think.\nI'm pretty neutral about the screen size. I understand some of the arguments people have made for why Apple continues to stick with 3.5 inches, and I certainly don't think the screen is too small, but I wouldn't say no to a slightly larger screen (say 4 inches or so). But I wouldn't buy a different phone just for a bigger screen either.\nI think the smaller size screen is a plus. Some of the Android phones are becoming so large they are not practical to easily put in/remove from a pocket and hold comfortably for a phone. I'd rather not see Apple make a larger screen iPhone.\nPeople these days prefer to have big screens, though not at the cost of portability. A cell phone for most needs to be cell phone. If I have bigger things to obtain I would go for a tablet. So for most I would prefer a decent size for a screen.\nI think that between the great job that Apple does with it's user interface, the faster processor, the improved camera and Siri. I am sold. That is going to be my next phone.\nThis is what i am thinking, I'm pretty neutral about the screen size. I understand some of the arguments people have made for why Apple continues to stick with 3.5 inches, and I certainly don't think the screen is too small, but I wouldn't say no to a slightly larger screen (say 4 inches or so).

So far, many have cast that disruption in a negative light and projected a future in which robots take jobs from human workers.\nThat\u2019s one way to look at it. Another is that automation may create more jobs than it displaces. By offering new tools for entrepreneurs, it may also create new lines of business that we can\u2019t imagine now.\nA recent study from Redwood Software and Sapio Research underscores this view. Participants in the 2017 study said they believe that 60 percent of businesses can be automated in the next five years.\nOn the other hand, Gartner predicts that by 2020 AI will produce more jobs than it displaces. Dennis Mortensen, CEO and founder of x.ai, maker of AI-based virtual assistant Amy, agreed. \u201cI look at our firm and two-thirds of the jobs here didn\u2019t exist a few years ago,\u201d said Mortensen.\nFor many reasons, the optimistic view is likely the more realistic one. But AI\u2019s ability to transform work is far from preordained. In 2018, workers are not being adequately prepared for their futures. The algorithms and data that underlie AI are also flawed and don\u2019t reflect the diverse society it\u2019s meant to serve.\nWhile AI will certainly displace some jobs, such displacement has occurred long before AI was on the scene. In the past century, we\u2019ve seen the demise or diminishment of titles like travel agent, switchboard operator, milkman, elevator operator and bowling alley pinsetter. Meanwhile, new titles like app developer, social media director, and data scientist have emerged.\nDaugherty and Jim Wilson, managing director of Information Technology and Business Research at Accenture Research have co-authored a book titled Human+Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI. In their view, future (and current) jobs include trainers and explainers. Trainers will teach AI systems how to perform and mimic human behaviors. Explainers will liaise between machines and human supervisors.\nChatbots have recently emerged as a new communications conduit for brands and consumers. It\u2019s no secret though that they have often been stiff and offered inappropriate responses. For instance, we might say \u201cIt\u2019s raining again. Great,\u201d and humans would recognize the sarcasm. A machine wouldn\u2019t.\nUnderstanding language is one component of perfecting chatbots. Another is empathy. A new wave of startups is injecting the emotional intelligence into chatbot-based communication.\nIn addition, companies like Facebook and Google use humans to moderate content. Facebook currently employs around 7,500 people for this purpose. Google parent company Alphabet also recently said it planned to have 10,000 people moderating YouTube content.\nTrainers bring a human element to AI systems, but \u201cexplainers\u201d will bridge the gap between the new systems and their human managers.\nC-suite executives, for instance, will be uneasy about basing decisions on \u201cblack box\u201d algorithms. They will need explanations in plain English \u2014 delivered by a human \u2014 to ease their concerns.\nSuch explainers will perform \u201cautopsies\u201d when the machines make mistakes. They will also diagnose the error and help to take steps to avoid similar mistakes in the future.\nRather than replacing workers, AI can be a tool to help employees work better. A call center employee, for instance, can get instant intelligence about what the caller needs and do their work faster and better. That goes for businesses and industry too. In another example, in life sciences, Accenture is using deep learning and neural networks to help companies to bring treatments to market faster.\nIn addition to helping existing businesses, AI can create new ones. Such new business include digital-based elder care, AI-based agriculture and AI-based monitoring of sales calls.\nFinally, automation can be used to fill currently unfilled jobs. As Daugherty noted recently, there is a shortage of 150,000 truck drivers in the U.S. right now. \u201cWe need automation to improve the productivity of the drivers, the lifestyle of the drivers to attract more people to the industry,\u201d he said.\nIt will likely take a decade or so until some AI technologies become the norm. While that provides plenty of lead time for the transition, few companies are taking action now to train their workers. Another little-noticed problem is that the AI systems themselves are being created with data and algorithms that don\u2019t reflect the diverse American society.\nAnother issue to address in 2018 is the lack of diversity among the companies creating AI. As Li noted, this lack of diversity \u201cis a bias itself.\u201d Recent research from MIT has underscored this point. MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini said she found evidence that facial recognition systems recognizing white faces better than black faces. In particular, the study found that if the photo was of a white man, the systems guessed correctly more than 99 percent of the time. But for black women, the percentage as between 20 percent and 34 percent. Such biases have implications for the use of facial recognition for law enforcement, advertising and hiring.", "It's been six years since the last Cars movie (there were two Planes movies in that time), and the filmmakers have wisely decided to go back to basics for this one. After the sequel's foray into global spy mayhem, this movie keeps its focus on the race track. There's still that nagging lack of logic in the premise: a world of cars living like people, except that there are no people. But the oddest thing about this movie is that its themes are aimed at grown-ups, not children.\nIt opens as Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is at the top of his career, winning every race and celebrated as a rock star. Then young upstart Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer) beats him, using high-tech training methods. To boost his speed, McQueen's sponsor (Nathan Fillion) sets him up with hot new trainer Cruz (Cristela Alonzo). But the old-school McQueen doesn't like simulators; he wants to feel sand in is tyres. So he takes Cruz on a cross-country trip to tap into his roots and show her the purity of racing on a dirt track. This involves seeking out salty old trainer Smokey (Chris Cooper) as McQueen prepares for a make-or-break race. Meanwhile, a TV pundit (Kerry Washington) drastically cuts McQueen's odds of winning any more races at all.\nIt's unlikely that kids in the audience will be able to identify with the central idea that you need to recognise when it's time to step aside for the younger generation. But then, they're mainly watching these movies for the vroom-vroom action, then buying the merchandise and recreating the races at home. The plot is for the adults, really, and this film provides a very nice story arc for McQueen (and Cruz as well). There is also, of course, a non-stop barrage of automotive puns and sight gags, silly side characters and wacky action. The stand-out scene is a riotous demolition derby in the mud.\nPercy Jackson is the demi-god son of Poseidon and, what's more, all his friends are children of famous Greek gods too. When what he thought was a safe haven, Camp Half-Blood, is suddenly overrun by some deadly vengeful enemies who can only be defeated if her can locate the magical Golden Fleece. He and his friends Annabeth Chase and Tyson embark on a dangerous mission to bring down the reawakened spirit of Kronos, the father of Hades, and in doing so abandons his pride as he enlists the help of the arrogant and very feisty Clarisse La Rue, daughter of the God of War, who is his only hope at staying alive. Unfortunately, the journey ahead is not smooth and they are about to discover what lies beneath the Sea of Monsters.\n'Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters' follows on from events in the 2010 original movie 'Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief'. It is based on the adored adventure novel series 'Percy Jackson & the Olympians' written by Rick Riordan. 'Sea of Monsters' sees Thor Freudenthal ('Diary of a Wimpy Kid', 'Hotel for Dogs') step into the role of director alongside screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski ('Ed Wood', 'Agent Cody Banks') and Marc Guggenheim ('Green Lantern', 'Arrow'). It is set to appear in cinemas on August 7th 2013.\nThe TV show lives on in video game form, for you.\nWhile dedicated fans wait patiently (or not so patiently in some cases) for a new series of Firefly, then can satisfy their cravings with a new mobile game, set for release on both iOS and Android in 2014. The announcement was made at San Diego Comic-Con, VG247 report.\nAndy Gore, CEO of QMXi and Quantum Mechanix Inc. said of the announcement, \u201cAt QMx, we know firsthand how great and powerful a franchise Firefly is and how mighty the Browncoats are.\u201d The Browncoats is the affectionate name of Firefly fans, after the Independence fighters in Joss Whedon\u2019s popular TV show, which was controversially cancelled after just one season.\nPixar revisits the characters from 2001's Monsters, Inc. for a frat-house prequel. Which is kind of an odd setting for a kids' movie. The comedy is more focussed on action sequences than characters this time, so it's not nearly as satisfying. But it's still a lot of fun, thanks to a constant barrage of sharp verbal and visual gags.\nWhen he was just a child, Mike (Crystal) dreamed about becoming a scarer, capturing the screams of human children to provide power to Monstropolis. So he's thrilled when he enters Monsters University, and takes his studies very seriously. By contrast, his roommate Randy (Buscemi) is more interested in partying, while classmate Sulley (Goodman) is lazily coasting on the legacy of his famed scarer dad. Then Mike and Sulley end up on the wrong side of Dean Hardscrabble (Mirren), who gives them one chance to stay in school: they have to win the Scare Games. But the only frat-house that needs them is made up of unscary misfits: nice-guy Dan (Murray), two-headed dimwit Terry/Terri (Hayes/Foley), naive five-eyed Squishy (Sohn) and furry philosopher Art (Day).\nWe never really doubt where this is going, but the filmmakers have a lot of fun along the way, and the story does take some surprising twists. Essentially, it's the same premise as Glee, with nerdy outcasts banding together to draw on their personal talents and show the cool kids that they're not losers. The script never really develops any of the side characters beyond one key personality trait, but the relationship between Mike and Sulley has a real kick of emotional resonance, superbly well-voiced by Crystal and Goodman. And the bromance between these two is even more enjoyable than all the colourful mayhem and snappy joking around.\nJoss Whedon's Much Ado About Nothing appears to be a success with critics, but can it be a hit with audiences too?\nJoss Whedon proves he is more than just the guy behind The Avengers with Much Ado About Nothing, a 2012 independent romantic comedy film based on the William Shakespeare play of the same name. The movie stars Amy Acker, Alexis Denisof and Nathan Fillion and premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival. It has gained stunning reviews ahead of its North American theatrical release this week.\nGenerally considered to be Shakespeare's finest comedy, the story follows two pairs of lovers, Benedick and Beatrice and Claudio and Hero. The former couple are witty and often proclaim their disdain for love, while the latter are young, perhaps na\u00efve and infatuated with one another. Critics fell in love with the Whedon's reimagining of the play, \"Joss Whedon's Much Ado About Nothing is both a palate cleanser for the director and a small but savory treat for Shakespeare-starved audiences,\" said Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post agreed, writing, \"Joss Whedon's fresh and cheeky adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing is a minor miracle - the first filmed Shakespeare comedy in decades that's actually funny.\" The Hollywood Reporter called it \"one of the funniest Shakespeare films in ages,\" while Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com said, \"It definitely possesses that Whedon-esque nerdy energy, fizzing with humor, eroticism, booze and more than a hint of danger.\"\nShot in just 12 days, primarily at Joss Whedon's own residence in Santa Monica, California, the black-and-white movie hits selected theaters in the U.S. on Friday (June 7, 2013).\n'Percy Jackson & The Olympians: Sea Of Monsters' is due for release this summer with fantastic new cast additions along with welcome returns from 'The Lightning Thief' ensemble.\nThe trailer for the second instalment of the Percy Jackson series 'The Sea of Monsters' is finally here welcoming the return of four members of 'The Lightning Thief's all-star cast along with some exciting new additions.\nFollowing a pretty harrowing school year in discovering that his father is the Greek god Poseidon in 'Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief', Percy Jackson's ordeal is nowhere near over. In the words of Spider-Man, 'With great power comes great responsibility' and that certainly applies here as now the new Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters trailer shows that Percy is forced to defend his half-god friends and family from the destructive forces of Kronos; a force so evil his sons Zeus, Hades and Poseidon had him destroyed. With his dark spirit now a threat to the world, Percy must recover the Golden Fleece; the only object that can save the world and which is located in the unambiguously named Sea of Monsters. Returning to join him on his quest is his good friend Annabeth Chase played by Alexandra Daddario plus new additions in the shape Douglas Smith as his half-brother Tyson and Leven Rambin, who plays the feisty Clarisse, daughter of the God of War. Logan Lerman makes his return as Percy and Jake Abel is back as the double-crossing son of Hermes, Luke. We also see Brandon T. Jackson back as Percy's best friend Grover Underwood, who's less than happy about Percy's dangerous mission.\nIf Percy Jackson's life hadn't already become chaotic enough already what with discovering that he's the demi-god son of Poseidon and that his friends are all children of Olympus, it's about to get even more out of control as his safe haven Camp Half-Blood suddenly comes under attack from some deadly foes hell bent on revenge. To save his kind, he must find the Golden Fleece in order to defeat the reawakened spirit of Kronos; the father of Hades, Zeus and Poseidon all of whom destroyed him many years ago. The Fleece can be found in the tumultuous waters of the Sea of Monsters, located in the Bermuda Triangle. To get hold of it, Percy must band together with the daughter of the God of War, Clarisse La Rue; his half-brother Tyson; and his other trusted friend Annabeth Chase. However, the journey doesn't bode to be easy and they discover just why the Sea of Monsters is named thus.\n'Percy Jackson & The Olympians: Sea Of Monsters' is the sequel to the 2010 movie 'Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief'; both based on the fantasy book series written by Rick Riordan. It has been directed by Thor Freudenthal ('Diary of a Wimpy Kid', 'Hotel for Dogs') and with several screenwriters: Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski ('Ed Wood', 'Agent Cody Banks'), and Marc Guggenheim ('Green Lantern', 'Arrow'). It is due to theaters from August 16th 2013.\nWhen Don Pedro arrives in Messina with his officers Benedick and Claudio, they meet with the Messina Governor Leonato and Claudio subsequently falls head over heels for his daughter Hero but is too shy to court her. Benedick makes it clear that he will never be married, sharing a similar feeling with Leonato's niece Beatrice with whom he strikes up a fiery relationship. While Don Pedro goes about tricking Claudio into wooing Hero and getting Benedick and Beatrice to confess their love for one another, his bitter brother Don John goes about trying to break up the peace in the group with his own callous plotting.

The city of Caesarea, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu owns a house, has long been associated with luxury villas and the super-rich.\nBut for the Palestinian citizens of Israel living just across the other side of the city's land barrier, the reality is markedly different.\nJisr al-Zarqa, the last remaining Palestinian town on Israel's coast, is among the poorest and most densely populated in the country. Here, buildings are packed on every available plot of land, with barely any trees left.\nHome to 15,000 Palestinians, Jisr al-Zarqa has for years faced a serious housing crisis, its land swallowed to make room for government infrastructure projects such as a highway that connects Tel Aviv to Haifa.\nIn the past 20 years, Israeli authorities also declared some of Jisr al-Zarqa's land as protected nature reserves, making the remaining land unusable.\nJisr al-Zarqa, the last remaining Palestinian town on Israel's coast, is among the poorest and most densely populated in the country.\nDays before Israelis take to the polls on April 9, residents here appear indifferent, angry at long-standing government neglect. Left abandoned to fend for themselves and faced with high unemployment, they say the state discriminates against their town as its population is Palestinian.\n\"[The housing crisis exists] not because there is no space. It's because the Jewish kibbutzim (communal settlements in Hebrew) took the lands around and they refused to give back the lands to the village, to allow this village to expand,\" said Jafar Farah, the director of the Haifa-based Mossawa Centre - The Advocacy Centre for Arab Citizens in Israel.\n\"After 70 years [since the creation of the state of Israel] you should see development,\" Farah added. \"Why is the situation like this? It's because of the vision of Israel as a Jewish state. It has isolated Palestinian communities, even in a beautiful place like this, it created poverty and anger in the community.\"\nLocked in on all sides with Caesarea to the south, Ma'agan Michael kibbutz (a collective community) to the north and the Jewish town Beit Hanania to the east, Jisr al-Zarqa's growing population is squeezed within 1,500 dunams (150 hectares) of land.\nMeanwhile, in Beit Hanania, 900 people live on 3,000 dunams (300 hectares) of land, according to Murad Amash, the head of Jisr al-Zarqa's local council.\nInside his office, an aerial map shows the Ma'agan Michael kibbutz's huge aquaculture fish ponds, covering an area of 2,400 dunams (240 hectares). A world-class fish breeding centre, the kibbutz also boasts field crops, orchards and greenhouses producing a variety of fruits, some of which are exported to Europe. Ma'agan Michael is also home to Plasson, a plastics factory and the kibbutz's main source of income.\nBut Amash said that when Jisr al-Zarqa's local council asked the state to set up industrial fish ponds as a source of income for the town, its request was rejected.\n\"We believe it's our right to have some kind of support from the state of Israel. We are citizens of the state. There has been a lot of talks and negotiations on it, but the state didn't accept this request,\" Amash said.\nEvery year, an additional 200 housing units are needed in Jisr al-Zarqa, but it is difficult to find the space. As a result, multiple families end up sharing homes, which in turn strains social relations and in many cases leads to couples divorcing, according to Amash.\nLacking basic services due to the limited access to state funding, residents resort to burning their own rubbish as the town does not have the resources to provide regular collection.\nAccording to Amash, the town has offered the government various plans and options to expand their land for the past 14 years, such as using the remaining land next to the barrier that separates Caesarea - but their requests were to no avail.\nHe added that an industrial zone would also help alleviate the high unemployment rate, reportedly at 30 percent. In contrast, Israel's nationwide unemployment rate stands at just four percent.\n\"It's not just that we're neglected and abandoned. The state is doing it on purpose,\" Amash said.\nIn the lead-up to Tuesday's election, some MKs, or the members of Knesset (the Israeli parliament), and party leaders have visited Jisr al-Zarqa for campaign purposes.\nAmash said he was still undecided as to which party he would vote for due to their failure to address the town's severe problems.\nHe noted that while Arab MKs are willing to listen and have in the past attempted to raise the issue with government ministers, there has been no progress as no Arab party has ever been part of the government in Israel.\nIn November 2017, Netanyahu visited Jisr al-Zarqa to attend the opening ceremony of a new police station to address rising incidents of violence, including gang warfare.\nAmash said he told the prime minister that while the police station may help curb street violence, it could not solve the dilapidated town's economic and social problems.\n\"If you help Jisr al-Zarqa, you'll have real respect in all Arab communities, not just Jisr al-Zarqa,\" Amash recounted telling him.\nIn his speech at the time, Netanyahu admitted that the government had long ignored Jisr al-Zarqa and promised to visit more to work together with local authorities in order to improve living conditions, Amash said.\nThat was the last time they saw him, he added.\nFarah, of Mossawa, said that while Palestinian citizens of Israel can have an effect on Tuesday in changing a Netanyahu coalition, there will likely be a low voter turnout.\n\"[Palestinian citizens of Israel] do not feel that voting will change the 70 years experience of being marginalised, second-class citizens of the state, who are subjected to institutionalised racism and discrimination, including through the Jewish nation-state law and other laws and policies,\" Farah said.\nIn July, the Knesset adopted a law which defined Israel as the exclusive homeland of the Jewish people, further marginalising the 1.8 million Palestinian citizens in the country.\nAmid the grim reality, Palestinians living in Israel have been relying on efforts to form a strong civil society in order to improve the conditions of their community.\nOne of the grassroots organisations is Mossawa, whose advocacy work has successfully forced the government to fund the first early childhood centre in Jisr al-Zarqa (at least six are needed); a programme training 50 nurses; and a project to build 400 housing units.\n\"Finally, after 70 years of discrimination, the city council is able to get approval for building a new neighbourhood,\" Farah said, adding that the government two years ago set up public transportation in the town.\nMossawa has also helped train women to boost their income by producing handmade products for sale, while its volunteers regularly team up with locals to clean up the town and decorate murals, among other activities.\nFarah said it's important to empower the people by taking back \"ownership of their streets\".\n\"The general feeling is that you don't feel like you belong any more. People don't feel that their villages and cities belong to them. People are afraid,\" Farah said.", "\"As a regulator, I feel that if the project is registered with the Rera, every problem that a consumer faces has to be resolved by Rera only,\" said MahaRera chief Gautam Chatterjee.\nMaharashtra's realty sector regulator MahaRera has questioned the rationale behind government decision to treat homebuyers as financial creditors by empowering them to drag their builders to NCLTs, saying the move whittles down its powers.\nCity-based consumer body Mumbai Grahak Panchayat (MGP) also echoes similar views, saying it would have been better if the government empowered Rera itself since it is an exclusive law to deal with the real estate sector and not to take the IBC route.\nMahaRera chief Gautam Chatterjee feels that the Rera should be the sole authority to redress consumer grievances in the realty space even though he has welcomed the Central government decision to empower homebuyers by giving them the status of financial creditors under the bankruptcy law.\nMahaRera, the first such watchdog to be set up in the country, has opined that there is no need to unnecessarily create an understanding or misunderstanding for homebuyers whether to go to the Rera or the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) if her developer fails to complete the project on time.\n\"As a regulator, I feel that if the project is registered with the Rera, every problem that a consumer faces has to be resolved by Rera only,\" said Chatterjee.\nOn June 6, President Ram Nath Kovind had promulgated the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 that recognises homebuyers as financial creditors under the insolvency law, or the IBC.\nThis would give them due representation in the committee of creditors and make them an integral part of the resolution/decision-making process.\n\"Though the government will have to sort out this matter between the corporate affairs and housing ministries, since we have a specific law for the real estate sector, why should a general law that is meant for all insolvency problems apply to a specific law?\" Chatterjee questioned.\nCiting the example of non-banking financial services providers being exempted from the IBC as there is Sebi to look into issues regarding them, he said, \"Why should real estate be included if there is already Rera to regulate the sector?\"\nEchoing similar views, MGP member Shirish Deshpande said, \"We are studying the implications of this decision. On the face of it, we feel that instead of allowing homebuyers to drag builders to the NCLT, why not empower Rera itself since it is an exclusive law to deal with the real estate?\"\nHe said unlike other companies, in the real estate space, there are two sets of consumers -- those who want their money back in case the builder defaults and others who would wait till the developer completes the project, as such homebuyers have already invested their money.\n\"If it's an incomplete project there is no society formed. Then you have the buyers with varied interests. So, in this situation who will represent the buyers,\" Deshpande wondered.\nHe said the MGP and MahaRera are planning to approach the authorities concerned to harmonise the entire system and to convince them to empower Rera to handle all types of real estate related issues.\n\"Once the claim is admitted in the NCLT, the most disastrous effect is that the very next day the board of directors of that company gets suspended and all the cases against the builder gets stayed whether they are in Rera, or civil or consumer courts or any such forum.\n\"We also feel that the Act can also be misused by some developers. Therefore, we want Rera to be the sole authority,\" he added.\nChatterjee also said the MahaRera and the MGP will hold talks with developers associations like Credai and Naredco and if they agree with our view, we would take it to the next level.\nThe Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) was set up afer the Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) came into force. Maharashtra was the first state to set up the authority under the landmark act passed in 2016.", "11 others injure\u00add in the blast, which took place in a madras\u00adsah.\nKARACHI: A blast in Karachi\u2019s Orangi Town left three children dead and injured 11 others, Express News reported on Monday.\nThe explosion reportedly took place in a madrassah in Frontier Colony.

Evidence was collected from blast site and the Bomb Disposal Squad was also summoned.\nNobody has so far claimed responsibility for the attack.\nExplosive material weighing 8 to 10kgs was used, while timed IED device was planted in a rickshaw.\nA tank at the manufacturing unit of a multinational soft drink company was damaged in a low-intensity blast.\nYAWN!

Our heart and prayers are with the families and friends of those who are affected by this attack. We sincerely hope that they will find the strength to deal with this tragedy. We also hope and pray to see the critically injured make a quick and full recovery.

I dont think so\u2026maybe provided by the imam of the madarsaa to train the youth for future leadership roles.\nIt is sad that we are confronted with terrorism. Every where in world, when terror groups have stuck people, the Government has to clearly define the anti terror policy and amended the laws accordingly. We are still living under the East India Company model of police service structure. We have failed to reform Police or raise dedicated anti terror organization to flight back with these groups.\nYoung and educated youth of Karachi, having BBA and MBA or law degrees are required to be directly inducted in Police as Inspectors and DSP to own this public service organization. Then all ranks of Police must be residents of the locality which they are supposed to be supervising. These are basics of policing in any developed and non-abusive police organization. Do it and you will see the results. The era of personality cult as well as cheap publicity is over and will not work anymore.", "Its latest proposal would allow small businesses to provide 401(k)s through associations.\nRoughly a third of privately employed American workers \u2014 and half of those at businesses with fewer than 100 employees \u2014 don\u2019t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. This means that they have to figure out other options for themselves, and that they can lose out on some of the tax breaks everyone else gets. Unsurprisingly, they also save far less for retirement.\nThis isn\u2019t merely the free market at work \u2014 and not just because special tax incentives are involved. (That\u2019s a completely different article.) Current regulations make it difficult to provide \u201cmultiple-employer\u201d plans, under which small employers work together to cut costs and offer retirement benefits as a group. Since small businesses that don\u2019t offer plans often say cost is the reason, loosening these regulations could greatly improve the situation. And a proposed rule from the Trump administration\u2019s Labor Department would do just that.\nThis is a commonsensical proposal, following suggestions endorsed by business and retirement groups alike, to put big and small businesses on similar footing when it comes to offering retirement benefits. Even in 2018 it is the kind of thing that should receive bipartisan support. The one risk is that it could be challenged in court for pushing the boundaries of the current statutes, which Congress can and should fix.\nDespite the advantages of multiple-employer plans, today it is rather difficult to offer them. As a Prudential report explained last year, the practice is essentially limited to \u201ctrade associations whose members share a commonality of interest; professional employee organizations (PEOs) that share a co-employer relationship with their clients; and certain large employers who wind up sponsoring MEPs as the result of a corporate restructuring or similar transaction.\u201d The new rule would allow associations based on simple geography and industry to offer plans, as well as expanding the allowed role of PEOs (such as Paychex).\nThe big question, unfortunately, is whether it\u2019s legal.\nThe administration made a very similar move earlier this year when it came to health-care plans. That rule has seen some success \u2014 for instance, the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce now offers health insurance to businesses of all sizes \u2014 but it has also been challenged in court by a group of attorneys general who claim it violates various laws, including the Affordable Care Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).\nOne way to solve this problem would be for the administration to convince the courts that its changes are consistent with the statutes, which is certainly a strong possibility \u2014 the executive branch has discretion to interpret ambiguous laws, and nothing in the statute directly contradicts the proposed interpretation. A much simpler one would be for Congress to do its job and change the law, but perhaps we shouldn\u2019t hold our breath for that.\nRegardless, association retirement plans are an enormously promising concept, and the administration\u2019s new rule would allow them to expand. That is a good thing, and policymakers should ensure that it comes to be.", "Local artist Jaquie Carmichael\u2019s \u2018String, Clay and Feathers\u2019 exhibit will open this Monday in Port Lincoln.

He was sidelined for six games last season with a broken right hand and then suffered an eerily similar injury almost one year to the day in September. Coleman leaped to make a catch against Baltimore, fell hard on his right hand and broke a different bone.\nNow he\u2019s physically healed and mentally stronger than ever.\n\u201cStuff\u2019s not going to go always as planned,\u201d said Coleman, who had six catches for 62 yards and a touchdown in Cleveland\u2019s first two games.\nColeman gives the Browns (0-9) a much-needed offensive playmaker. Cleveland\u2019s receiving group has been a major disappointment, and Coleman\u2019s speed will surely help rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer expand the field.\nColeman\u2019s return is a welcomed respite in a season devoid of much positive news for the Browns.\n\u201cI love to see him back,\u201d left guard Joel Bitonio said Thursday. \u201cI know he was disappointed he got banged up earlier in the year.

I think he\u2019s ready to come back and make a name for himself.\nColeman still has to prove to the Browns that he can be durable and consistent. After he returned from his injury last season, Coleman made only 26 catches for 240 yards and a touchdown in his final eight games.\nThat\u2019s not nearly enough production for a No. 1 wide receiver, which is why coach Hue Jackson challenged Coleman in the off-season to do more.\nThe most recent injury was a setback, but Coleman is determined to make up for lost time.\nTo Jackson, that\u2019s helping Kizer.\nNOTES: To make room for Coleman, the Browns waived WR Kasen Williams, who made just nine catches for 84 yards after he was claimed off waivers in September. \u2026 The team also waived DB Ibraheim Campbell from injured reserve and RB Terrence Magee was signed from the practice squad to Atlanta\u2019s active roster. \u2026 Starting C JC Tretter (shoulder, knee, quad) and RT Shon Coleman (concussion) did not practice for the second straight day, but Jackson has not ruled them out of Sunday\u2019s game.", "SKODA building a model called a Yeti in the bad old days would have been unthinkable \u2013 as it would have invited even more of the ridicule that was the Czech car maker\u2019s lot before Volkswagen took control.\nThat the company is now self-confident enough to do this \u2013 and provide a key fob with a furry attachment presumably intended to invoke the spirit of the Abominable Snowman himself \u2013 speaks volumes for how Skoda has progressed.\nThe Yeti is the fifth new model produced since the German takeover and it is perhaps the most daring as it ventures into a new sector of the market being fiercely competed for \u2013 that of the \u2018crossover\u2019.\nIn Skoda\u2019s own words the Yeti is aiming for the buyer who wants a combination of the rugged strength of an off-roader, combined with the practicality and running costs of a hatchback that is as far as possible friendly to the environment.\nA sales-winning formula if ever there was one which is why the last few years has seen a blizzard of motor manufacturers launching their own take on the \u2018crossover\u2019 concept.\nThe Yeti then needs to distinguish itself from a pack of competitors and Skoda\u2019s designers and engineers have risen to the challenge.\nApproaching the Yeti for the first time the initial thing you notice is its striking profile. The front is pure Skoda with the chrome-faced grille and V-shaped bonnet line leaving no doubt as to whose family it belongs.\nThere are also large high-mounted headlights giving the front end a distinctive and friendly face. The strong lines continue along the side where the large wheel arches and lower body protection strips give the car a flowing profile.\nAt the rear the Yeti has an eye-catching wraparound design that creates a continuous window surface that allows a tremendous amount of light into the cabin.\nThe tailgate is generously sized and, thanks to the car\u2019s ride height, even tall drivers can stand underneath it when open. There\u2019s also a drop down handle removing the need for a step ladder to close it for those more vertically challenged.\nThe interior displays similarly clever design traits highlighted by the inventive Varioflex system that allows seats to be moved forward or backwards, reclined individually, rolled up completely or removed. This allows rear seat passengers to find the most comfortable seating position while also maximising boot space.\nIf you\u2019ve got a few extra quid going spare add the electrically operated panoramic sunroof as an optional extra \u2013 it\u2019s worth the admission price all on its own.\nThere are five turbocharged engines available. The two-wheel drive model comes with the 105bhp 1.2-litre petrol which provides a decent amount of urge and good fuel economy.\nThe front-wheel drive Yetis are attractively priced and should hold their value well, but the four-wheel drive models look a little bit on the expensive side.\nThe Yeti guards its occupants with active anti-whiplash head restraints and twin front, side and curtain airbags. The Elegance model I drove also comes with a driver\u2019s knee bag and stability control.\nThere are a fair amount of goodies included \u2013 with even the entry-level model getting air conditioning, remote locking, electric front windows and a CD player.\nThe S model adds alloy wheels, front fog lights, and powered rear windows.

Michelle Obama, in fact, has just launched an entire \"Let's Move\" healthy eating and fitness campaign, prompted by concern over the growing number of obese children (according to Newsweek, obesity among 12-19 year olds has tripled since 1980). But research just published by Scripps Research Institute associate professor Paul Kenny and graduate student Paul Johnson provides yet another reason to indulge with caution: Ding-Dongs, it turns out, are addictive.\nIn all fairness to Hostess, it's not just Ding-Dongs. The cream-filled chocolate snack cakes were just one of the \"high-fat, palatable foods\" that Kenny and Johnson used to test if obesity in rats could alter the neurological chemistry of their brains the same way that cocaine or heroin use did. And the answer they discovered was: yes, it can.\nIn the brains of rats (and humans), a neurotransmitter called dopamine is released by pleasurable experiences. So the initial intake of highly palatable foods (or use of a drug like cocaine) releases dopamine, stimulates something called the dopamine D2 receptors, and causes a good psychological feeling. But what Kenny and Johnson found was that as their test rats ate more and more of the high-fat food, and became obese, the resulting regular overstimulation of the D2 receptors caused the brain to compensate -- just like it apparently does in the case of cocaine users. The D2 receptors became less sensitive. So what began as impulsive behavior became compulsive behavior: the rats had to keep overindulging in the high-fat food just to keep their D2 receptors stimulated enough to avoid feeling bad.\n\"What we found, in essence, was that the rats were in a persistent state of withdrawal,\" Kenny said.\nThe researchers also found that the obese rats' need for the high-fat food became so great that they would continue to seek it out even when it was associated with electric shocks. And when the high-fat food was taken away, the obese rats chose not to eat at all rather than partake of more healthy food, even though they were hungry. It wasn't a matter of normal choice anymore. The rats had become, quite literally, addicted to the food.\n\"This whole notion of being addicted to food is kind of fascinating and strange,\" Kenny said. \"I mean, in a sense, we kind of all are [addicted to food].\" But the especially yummy, high-fat foods created the same changes in brain chemistry, and the same shift from impulsive to compulsive use, as had previously been observed with cocaine or heroin.\n\"One of the important things we found was that access to palatable foods mattered,\" Kenny noted. \"The more access [the rats] had, the more likely they were to 'use' a ding dong. And the more often they 'used' it, the more likely they were to 'use' it again.\"\nKenny and Johnson even tested how a genetic predisposition to addiction might affect the rats' response to the high-fat food. They gave one group of rats a virus that knocked down the activity of their D2 receptors, simulating the brain chemistry of people who are thought to have \"addictive personalities,\" or a DNA inclination toward addiction. (In human studies, people with low D2 receptor levels have been found to have a greater inclination toward risky, impulsive behavior -- and a greater vulnerability to drug use and addiction.) Kenny and Johnson found that the rats with the artificially-lowered D2 levels did, indeed, become compulsive eaters of the high-fat food more quickly than their control group counterparts.\nWhat are the implications of all this? Well, for starters, the research offers a far scarier take on the hazards of unhealthy eating. It's one thing to resist overindulging in cheesecake and Ding-Dongs because they'll get you fat -- and potentially bring on physical health problems thought to be associated with obesity. But it's far more sobering to think that the very act of eating too much high-fat food can alter our brain chemistry, making us dependent on more of it. Especially because, as Kenny said, reversing those \"addictive\" changes in psychological/neurological brain chemistry takes far longer, and is a far greater challenge, than overcoming any physical withdrawal or need for a substance.\nThe results also offer a new twist in how we view persistent obesity. If an obese person has to keep eating high-fat food to avoid the psychological crash of withdrawal, losing weight isn't just an easy matter of making better food choices. It's a far more complex and daunting challenge that might need to be approached like we now approach drug rehabilitation. Of course, Overeaters Anonymous has intuitively understood this for years. But Kenny and Johnson's research potentially offers a cellular, neurological underpinning for that idea.\nBut more than anything else, Kenny and Johnson's research underscores just how important Michelle Obama's new crusade is. If access to junk food is a big factor in the development of an addiction, and the changes in brain chemistry are far tougher to undo than they are to avoid, then getting parents and schools to limit that access for children is really critical. Not just for kids' physical health, but for their long-term neurological health as well. And while Kenney's research didn't specifically test whether rats with lower D2 levels from overeating were then more inclined to undertake other risky behaviors, that would certainly be another argument for fighting childhood obesity.\nAdmittedly, it's a little hard to think of cheesecake in the same category as cocaine. It's like the Brazilian caipirinha: a drink so light, fruity, and yummy that it's hard to believe it packs the punch of a double martini. But Kenny and Johnson's research at least helps explain why eating dessert and junk food feels sooooo good. It's because they're titillating a lot more than just our taste buds. And if junk food really does mess with our brain chemistry over time, or if we gain too much weight from it, it's a pretty compelling reason to make smarter food choices -- while we still have the control to make them.", "The Burundian authorities should overturn the 32-year sentence handed to human rights defender Germain Rukuki and set him free, Amnesty International said following his appeal hearing on 26 November.\n\u201cGermain was tried and imprisoned simply because he worked for a human rights organization.

He was 90 years old.\nReb Yehoshua Zvi founded the organization to serve the Boro Park community in 1978. It soon expanded to making weekly deliveries to Flatbush as well. Later, other people founded Tomchei Shabbos in their own communities based off his model and idea.\nTomchei Shabbos of Boro Park / Flatbush delivers food to around 700 families every week.\nOne person who makes weekly deliveries for the past 25 years told YWN that he would deliver tons of food to Lakewood, Monsey, Kiryas Yoel and other communities each year before Pesach \u2013 until those communities began to open their own organizations.\nThe Niftar did this without fanfare and was almost unknown to even the recipients of the weekly deliveries. He was a long-time employee of the United States Postal Service, and received an award on the day of his retirement for not missing one day of work during his entire career.\nHi Chesed is legendary, but did everything quietly and behind the scenes.\nMuch can \u2013 and will be written about this giant of a man who was taken from us.\nThe Levaya will be held today (Monday) at 1:00PM in front of the Tomche Shabbos building located at 6225 New Utrecht Ave. The Kevura will be at around 3:00PM at the Satmar Cemetery in Deans, N.J.\nBurech dyen emes: i will never forget when 35 years ago i was a yingerman and i lived in apartment house on 15th ave. and a lady came knocking on my door that the lady next to her comes every morning to borrow 2 slices bread and a cup of milk. She asked me to investigate whats going on in her home that she needs to borrow. Next hour i went with my wife knocking on her door and asked to speak to her. She invited us in and i walked staright to the fridge and found empty shelves, i opened the freezer and it was empty. i had the guts to open her cabinets and found only dishes with not a stitch of food. I asked her what caused her to live in such poverty with 2 kids when there are so many food programs from the city,food stamps or meals on wheels. She told us that her husband left them and when ever she applied for food stamps he called the city and said that he is gives her full support therefore they cut off her assistance. The same day i called Mr. Hershkovitz a\u201dh and explained to him the whole story.\nMr. Hershkowitz called me back in 3 hours and told me that he set up an account at the local grocery for her to shop every day with a $250 allowance per week. This is probably only a tip of the iceberg of the thousands of stories that klal yisroel will be writing in the next years to come from this great Tzadik.\nWhile the niftar definitely gets a lot of credit for building Tomchei Shabbos to the massive Chesed organization it is today .\nIt was actually founded way before 1978 by R\u2019 Simcha Kovalenko Zatzal And others .\nHrah\u201dz R\u2019 yeshia tzvi and his wife Sarah Brucha we\u2019re the ones that founded \u05ea\u05d5\u05de\u05db\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea long before anyone thought about such an organization, even they themselves didn\u2019t believe they will get this far into serving approx 700 families weekly.

My mother once explained to him that having the boxes delivered caused my father great shame, it was then that he started a \u201cvoucher\u201d program.\nEvery week my mother went to KRM and with dignity paid with a tomchei shabbos voucher that looked like a credit card.\nI\u2019ve spoken to Tomchei Shabbos and asked them to restart that program but they said they don\u2019t do it anymore.\nI know that Rabbi Hershkowitz zt\u201dl took great pride in it- As he would call us to see if the amount was enough and that the card worked. Perhaps they can reinstate l\u2019ilui nishmaso.\nUnfortunately my husband and I are on hard times and many weeks don\u2019t have for shabbos, yet my children are too embarrassed to have the deliveries and out of their respect I have chosen not to receive tomchei shabbos and B\u201dH, I make a beautiful shabbos and yom tov with HaShems help.\nBut anyone that has the power to discuss this voucher program with the current administration of Tomchei shabbos should please grab this mitzvah.

Otero applied Texas law because Daniels is a resident of Texas.\nThe Texas law requires the losing party in a SLAPP case to pay the other side's legal fees. Trump's attorneys requested $340,000, but Otero on Tuesday said they were entitled to $292,052.33, finding that they had requested payment for more hours than they reasonably would have been expected to work.\n\"To litigate Plaintiff's defamation claim, Defendant used two partners and one senior associate in addition to two junior associates. Defendant could have streamlined litigation by distributing more work to the junior associates,\" he wrote.\nPoliticsStormy lost her suit against Trump, but she has another against his ex-lawyer. What's it about?\nThe Texas law also allows judges to impose extra sanctions to deter plaintiffs from bringing such \"frivolous\" cases in the future. But Otero found that the legal fees were enough, and noting that Daniels hasn't brought any other suits against the president for similar statements about her, he awarded only $1,000 in extra penalties.\n\"Plaintiff's unwillingness to resort to litigation in light of Defendant's continuing use of rhetorical hyperbole suggests that Plaintiff is already being deterred from filing meritless defamation claims,\" he wrote in a nine-page ruling filed in Los Angeles.\nTrump's attorney, Charles Harder, nonetheless called the award \"a total victory for the president, and a total defeat for Stormy Daniels in this case.\"\nDaniels didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Her attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Tuesday on Twitter that Trump and his attorneys were trying to \"fool the public about the importance of the attorneys' fees in the defamation case, which are a fraction of what they owe my client in the main NDA case.\"\n\"The main NDA case\" refers to a separate suit that Daniels has filed against Trump and his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, seeking to invalidate a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA, in which Cohen paid her $130,000 to remain silent about an affair she has alleged that she had with Trump before the 2016 presidential election.\nAttorneys for Trump and Cohen filed documents in September indicating that they don't intend to enforce the agreement. But Avenatti countered at the time that he and his client wanted to go forward with that suit, anyway.", "Having led the world in free and open markets for generations, America now faces a choice as simple as it is consequential: lead on trade, or get left behind.\nThe decision should be clear.\nCongress is considering whether to renew Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). TPA is a process between Congress and the administration for negotiating trade deals that has existed in some form for over 80 years. With TPA, Congress has greater influence over trade agreements, and U.S. negotiators hold a stronger position to secure a good deal for American producers, consumers and workers.\nAbsent TPA, the President has the constitutional power to negotiate trade agreements without Congressional input, transparency requirements or a mechanism to make agreements available for public review. But other countries will not engage in serious negotiations \u2013 or offer real concessions \u2013 until they know the U.S. is negotiating in good faith.\nThat is why TPA is essential. It puts Congress \u2013 not the administration \u2013 in charge of trade negotiation objectives. It sets clear transparency requirements and makes agreements available for public review. And it shows our trading partners that America can be trusted.\nIf the administration meets the TPA requirements, Congress gets the final say on any trade agreement through a yea-or-nay vote. If the administration fails, Congress has the power to cancel the vote and halt the agreement altogether. TPA ensures transparency and accountability.\nBut most Democrats are lined-up to oppose TPA and kill America\u2019s golden opportunity to expand free market policies to Asian countries under the growing influence of China. Liberals want to saddle Americans with higher taxes and more trade regulations. It\u2019s no surprise the anti-trade movement is led by organized labor and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.\nEven a few Republicans are considering joining the left-wing crusade against TPA and free trade. My message to them is simple: don\u2019t take the bait. Every objection is based on misinformation or economic fallacy.\nConcerned about secrecy? TPA requires any agreement to be made public at least 60 days before a vote. Concerned about transparency? TPA allows every Members of Congress to read negotiating text and receive briefings at any time. Concerned about Congress ceding authority? \u201cTPA grants no new authority to the President,\u201d confirms the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\nApart from these reasons, it\u2019s important to recognize the profound economic and strategic consequences at stake. Trade already is happening. The question is whether Congress will embrace measures to give the U.S. a competitive edge in the world, or allow our country to backslide into disastrous protectionist policies of bygone eras.\nSince World War II, no nation has actively promoted an open and stable system for global commerce more than America. Free trade lies at the heart of our country\u2019s post-1945 economic prosperity and global influence.\nBut nothing was pre-programmed. Time and again, America chose to boldly step up and advance free markets.\nThat same challenge exists today \u2013 and so should our commitment. If America fails to seize this opportunity, other nations will step in to claim the mantle of economic leadership. Or as Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan, both TPA supporters, put it: Who do you want to write the rules for the global economy in the 21st century \u2013 America or China?\nIt must be America. That\u2019s why Congress should renew TPA and strengthen our nation\u2019s hand in sealing two major trade agreements under discussion. One is a deal with eleven Pacific economies, including allies such as Japan, Australia and Singapore, and the other is with the European Union. Together, these deals would account for 65 percent of global economic output.\nThe potential gains are immense. Estimates have the deals boosting America\u2019s economy by at least $200 billion. The agreements would cut taxes on trade, dismantle unfair trade practices, and protect intellectual property rights for American workers and firms. Consumers would benefit from greater product choice and lower prices. Leading on trade also pressures other nations to establish their rules toward U.S. standards \u2013 not the other way around.\nStriking more open markets would be a massive win for our state and local economies. My home state, Texas, has led the country in international trade for 13 years. More than 60 percent of Texas\u2019 exports go to U.S. free trade partners. Exports would only increase with better access to Asian and European markets. That would be a boon for Texan exporters, 93 percent of which are small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth, the area I represent in Congress, global trade reached a record $72 billion in 2013. That same year DFW\u2019s trade growth was the second-fastest in the nation. And make no mistake: trade brings innovation, growth and well-paying jobs for all of America. One in five American jobs are supported by international trade, jobs that earn on average 13 to 18 percent more than non-trade jobs.\nFor our nation to grow in the future as it has in the past, America must lead on trade. Plain and simple, TPA is a proven and effective process to advance U.S. national interests. The U.S. has led the free and open international economic system for 70 years. There is no reason to surrender that lead now.", "Kyrie Irving leads way with 42 points as Cleveland just 1 win away from Finals.\nCLEVELAND \u2014 Kyrie Irving gritted his teeth, tightened up his left sneaker and hopped to his feet.\nThe pain couldn\u2019t stop him.

Trash him, day after day, and give him credit for nothing.\nHow can you act like you love America, and not appreciate the work President Trump has done? You have to have half a brain cell to not see this. When people run from the truth, it creates ignorance. The many good things President Trump has done are based on facts.

The letter suggested President Trump wanted to shoot kids who were trying to cross the border. This is a plain old lie.\nThe president did tell U.S. border agents to \u201cconsider rocks rifles.\u201d Rocks are considered, and would be in a court of law, depending on the circumstances, a deadly weapon. Give me the names of mothers, wives, or any loved one, who wouldn\u2019t care if our soldiers had rocks thrown at them. I love our military, police officers, or anyone who is protecting the citizens of the United States. When someone is trying to do them harm, I think they should have the right to defend themselves in whatever way they can.\nThe letter went on to state that President Trump does not know the U.S. Constitution. The constitution does not give anyone the right to enter our country when our laws say they can\u2019t. The constitution does not give anyone the right to destroy private property, throw rocks, shoot guns, or whatever, at our police or military. We\u2019ve had a breakdown of law and order. President Trump is the man with enough guts to bring it back.\nThe title The Daily Advance gave the letter was: Time for Americans to notice what is going on. The American people have already done this. This was done when President Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Clinton was a two-term first lady, a former U.S. senator and a former Secretary of State. And still, it wasn\u2019t good enough to keep Donald J. Trump from becoming president.\nIn 2020, President Trump will be re-elected for a second term by a landslide.

When it comes to crushing hunger, it's not about when you eat; it's about what you eat. If you wish to lose weight, curb your appetite by avoiding the foods that make you hungrier. Losing weight is a gradual process and it needs a lot of patience and hard work to achieve your goals. It means you have to eat the right food and exercise right in order to ensure a healthy weight loss. Moreover, you have to lead a healthy and physically active lifestyle. Someone has rightly said, you are what you eat. If you eat wrong foods like processed fatty foods, fried foods, tans-fat foods, et al, chances are you may suffer from obesity. On the other hand, eating right foods like fibre-rich foods and protein-rich foods may keep you healthy and help you lose weight.\nSalads are the epitome of diet-friendly meals; however, if you miss out on a mix of healthy foods and choose just one food-group in your salad, chances are that you are not getting enough satisfying sustenance to keep you going through the day. So if you are adding cucumber, kale, and spinach, you must also add protein (boiled eggs, chicken, salmon or legumes), with slow-burning carbs (roasted sweet potato, corn or brown rice) and a little fat (feta, nuts, seeds or avocados) can help settle those hunger pangs.\nSnacks preserved with sodium are generally highly refined, without filling you up. So if you think you are eating 'healthy diet chips,' you must know that these are actually not healthy, courtesy sodium. Excessive sodium can cause water retention, leaving your body bloated up. Also, sodium leaves you extremely thirsty.\nCommercially-bought or homemade fruit juices may look like the perfect options for gulping down to lose weight; however, they may actually not help in any way. Whenever you juice a fruit or vegetable, it tends to leave the fibres behind, making it useless, especially if you are looking to lose weight. It is best to have whole fruits and vegetables than gulping a glassful of juice.\nCommercially bought protein bars may look like the healthiest snack, but they have high amounts of sugar that tend to add more calories. Even if you wish to enjoy protein bars, make sure you make them at home. Here's a list of protein bars you can make at home.\nAvoid unhealthy diet practices and eat a healthy diet and engage in exercises to lose weight.", "However, this must not be a standalone action, but the beginning of a tightening of U.S. policy on Myanmar that is reflective of the gravity of this charge.\nIt is time for the United States to formally declare Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya campaign a genocide. It is not simply a moral imperative, but a strategic imperative for an administration whose foreign policy has frequently been called into question. Since being forced to flee to Bangladesh in 2017, the world has watched the plight of the over seven hundred thousand Rohingya refugees with concern, and condemned the Myanmar government\u2019s brutal military campaign that drove them out as well as the government\u2019s refusal to ensure safe return and accountability. This came to a head in the most recent United Nations report on the situation, where UN investigators described the military campaign as one driven by \u201cgenocidal intent\u201d and called for the prosecution of the generals responsible for genocide. In response, the International Criminal Court has stated that the court has jurisdiction to do so and the UN\u2019s Human Rights Council has overwhelmingly voted in support of creating an independent mechanism to expedite criminal prosecutions.\nThe United Nations\u2019 1948 Genocide Convention officially defines genocide as an act aiming to destroy, in whole or in part, a particular group. Such acts can include killing members of the group, causing serious bodily harm to them, trying to impose unlivable conditions on them, preventing births in the group or forcibly transferring children of that group. The international community is coming to the realization that the plight of the Rohingya is just such a situation, and, as stipulated in the State Department report, we could draw that conclusion as well.\nAgainst this backdrop, the U.S. response has fallen flat, and it has been left out of a leadership position that it would benefit from seizing. When presented with the opportunity to do so in the report, the United States failed to do so. Likewise, during his speech at the UN General Assembly, President Donald Trump rightly called out the horrific situations in both Syria and Venezuela, but remained silent on the plight of the Rohingya. The decision, at least in the report, was deliberately born out of concern over the legal implications such language would entail. The internal deliberations surrounding the report and the implications of it became so contentious that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at one point postponed its release indefinitely, only releasing it after pressure from legislators. But it is exactly that pressure that is part of the strategic imperative for pushing for a formal declaration of genocide. Yes, the United States has enacted new sanctions in the recent past, but it has yet to move the position of the Myanmar government nor satisfy U.S. legislators.\nIn a highly polarized political environment, calling Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya campaign an act of genocide is one of the few bipartisan issues with support in Congress. Leaders and members of the Republican and Democratic parties, led by the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Ed Royce, have urged the Trump administration to make a formal declaration of genocide. In a recent hearing, held two days after the release of the State Department\u2019s report, Chairman Royce stated: \u201cMaking a formal determination of genocide must be the next step for the U.S. Defining these atrocities for what they are is critical to building international public awareness\u2014and support\u2014to stop them.\u201d This position was supported by Ranking Member Rep. Eliot Engel, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, with a similar bipartisan statement being released by members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nBeyond simply being a bold decision that would help the State Department get its \u201cswagger\u201d back, this is a rare issue that the Trump administration could easily rally bipartisan Congressional support behind it. For an administration that is constantly looking for \u201cwins,\u201d it presents a rare opportunity to garner a \u201cwin\u201d that both Democrats and Republicans can agree upon. Moreover, this does not only pertain to the domestic sphere: the situation in Myanmar represents one of universal concern shared by the United States, UN, and European Union. With a recent Pew Research poll finding that seventy percent of global respondents did not have faith in this administration to do the right thing in world affairs, the United States should seize the initiative on the matter.\nSeveral weeks ago, former U.S. ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley announced that she was pushing for the UN investigators behind the recent report, which carries the phrase \u201cgenocidal intent,\u201d to brief the UN Security Council (UNSC). This decision came out of a recognition that \u201cthe military are at fault, the fact-finding mission came out and gave clear examples of what\u2019s happened. It\u2019s time for the international community to move.\u201d If the international community is to move, it will need a leader and the United States can define itself as such by taking the step of formally declaring a genocide at the upcoming UNSC meeting.\nHowever, this must not be a standalone action, but the beginning of a tightening of U.S. policy on Myanmar that is reflective of the gravity of this charge. Secretary Pompeo has already stated that the United States will hold those responsible accountable and that the Myanmar military must respect human rights.\nYet, the Myanmar government has done neither and remains defiant, as was in full display at the UN General Assembly this past week. Myanmar does not fear \u201cglobal scrutiny\u201d and U.S. actions, such as not even enforcing previous rounds of sanctions, have signaled that it should not. Making a formal declaration of genocide as the first step in intensifying policy on Myanmar is a logical move for the Trump administration. It would allow Washington to signal to the Myanmar government, the U.S. Congress and the international community that this is not acceptable behavior and that the United States has decided to be a leader on this issue.\nReflecting on Bosnia, President Bill Clinton noted \u201cWe learned that in the Balkans, inaction in the face of brutality, simply invites brutality. But firmness can stop armies and save lives.\u201d That firmness can start with the uttering of one word: genocide.\nSean P.

While media has only seen him throw lightly, he has let loose. And, as far as arm strength, he\u2019s close to where he was pre-injury.\nColts general manager Chris Ballard indicated last Friday that Luck would be ready to work with the team's starters when training camp starts.\nColts kicker Adam Vinatieri said in June that he has no doubt the Bengals will face Luck in their Week 1 showdown.\nLuck hasn't played in a game since Week 17 of the 2016 season and underwent surgery in January of 2017 to repair a torn labrum.\nLuck threw for 376 yards and a touchdown in the Colts' 26-10 win against the Bengals in their Wild Card meeting Jan. 4, 2015 in Indianapolis.\nLuck last faced the Bengals during the regular season on Oct. 19, 2014 in Indy, passing for 344 yards and two touchdowns in the Colts' 27-0 win.\nIn two regular-season games and one playoff game against the Bengals, Andrew Luck has thrown for 1,046 yards and seven touchdowns without an interception.\nIn April, The Enquirer's Jim Owczarski and Paul Dehner Jr. agreed that the Bengals-Colts matchup had gotten easier for Cincinnati.\nJO: The season opener. First of all, the Colts are terrible. I can't imagine Andrew Luck, who has yet to throw a football as of publication, will be ready to run a new offense and take hits from Geno Atkins and Carlos Dunlap in five months. But even if he is, his last game was Jan. 1, 2017. That's a lot of rust to shake off. Also, while the Bengals needed Dunlap's late game heroics to squeak out a 24-23 victory, they should be better to start 2018.\nPDJ: Agreement here. The uncertainty surrounding Luck is the biggest variable of this game and the rust he will have in his first real game will be part of the equation. Considering the putrid nature of the Colts roster, lessening the chances Luck from shows up and pulls off heroics will be a big deal in starting the season off on a good note.", "From the Granville train disaster to the long search for Matthew Leveson&apos;s remains, there isn&apos;t much Detective Sergeant Stephen Horn hasn&apos;t done in more than 50 years with NSW Police.\nThe veteran is hanging up his badge and hopes to spend more time with his family, and he spoke to A Current Affair about his career and the cases that have stayed with him.\n\"I&apos;ve always tried to give more than 100 percent - as I say to some young people, get down and get dirty,\" Det Sgt Horn said.\nHe joined the force in 1968, and for 44 years of his career he has been on the front line of crime scenes gathering any clue that might unravel a crime.\n\"Who else is going to speak for (the deceased) if not the police?\" he said.\nBut despite his long career, he admitted the burden could be a heavy one.\n\"I try not to take the work home and think about it at home, because if I worry about it and freak out and think about it, I&apos;ll end up making mistakes,\" he said.\n\"Multiple murders where a family has been murdered and children were involved - you always think to yourself, &apos;why the children?&apos;\"\nDet Sgt Horn was a fresh-faced, young forensic officer when a train derailed at Granville in Sydney in 1977.\nHis job was to retrieve the 83 victims who died, and identify them.\n\"We had a temporary morgue put up in a large tent and when portions of the concrete from the roadway were actually moved off the carriages, we would go down and retrieve the bodies and take them up to the morgue, do an initial examination of them, photograph them, look at their injuries, look at their clothing,\" he said.\nIt was far from the last disaster scene Det Sgt Horn would attend.\nHe also carried out his duties at the 1981 Sylvania Nursing Home fire (19 dead), the 1989 Kempsey bus crash (35 dead).\nAnd in 1991, he received a phone call that shaped his career.\nDet Sgt Horn was called on to investigate war crimes in Ukraine, where he dug up two mass graves and exhumed the remains of dozens of World War II victims - including 20 children.\n\"When we started to exhume these remains, we could actually see they were almost all grouped in an area - little tiny baby remains and things like that,\" he said.\n\"Why did this happen? Why were these children taken from this village when the information was they didn&apos;t know if they were Jews or not? They just decided to take them and dispose of them.\"\nHe spent three months in the trenches, with minimal food and supplies.\nBack home, the evolution of DNA technology has allowed Det Sgt Horne to solve cases that were otherwise impossible to crack.\n\"I think we had about 27 sexual assault cases solved with DNA, with about 33 charges - some of them serial offenders,\" he said.\nMost recently, Det Sgt Horn&apos;s experience played an integral role in finding Matthew Leveson&apos;s remains, 10 years after he went missing.\nIt is a gift Matthew&apos;s parents Mark and Faye Leveson could never repay.\n\"He helped bring our Matty home and without that, we might still be out there looking for him, so a massive thank-you isn&apos;t enough,\" Faye Leveson said.\nAssistant Commissioner Peter Cotter commended Det Sgt Horn&apos;s service.\n\"The NSW Police Force is extremely proud of you, we wish you the very best in retirement, and please go and enjoy yourself, and thank you for 50 years,\" he said.\nAnd Det Sgt Horn himself had one message for the new generation of young police officers.\n\"Be professional, diligent, loyal, courteous, and don&apos;t give up,\" he said.", "The public face of the Caterham F1 Team may be a green Formula One car whizzing round a track, but mobile communications plays a major role in making sure everything is ready for race day.\nAs the team's official mobile telecommunications partner, mobile operator Truphone provides Caterham F1 Team with a telecoms network to support global communication as and when it is needed.\nThe nature of the Formula One championship means that Caterham F1 Team, which has been competing in the Formula One Championship since 2012, needs to travel extensively and works worldwide to compete in 19 Grand Prix races.\nInternational mobile roaming is extremely costly, even for Formula One, and although the government recently signed a contract with several UK mobile operators to scrap mobile roaming charges by 2016, this is a long way off.\n\"Formula One is very much about mobility; it\u2019s a global sport,\" says Cyril Abiteboul, team principal of the Caterham F1 Team. \"The cost to attend an F1 calendar is in the region of \u00a312m. Just the cost of the freight, the cost of mobile telecommunications, the cost of getting the show ready.\"\nThis is without considering the cost of producing the car. Abiteboul says any reduction of these costs can be reinvested in improving Caterham\u2019s competitive advantage.\nThrough the Truphone network, calls are routed automatically such that a mobile call is charged at a local call rate as opposed to incurring a roaming charge.\nBill Peters, CIO for the Caterham Group said: \"We\u2019re targeting 30% reductions in our overall mobile call cost, which we\u2019re well on our way to achieve due to the Truphone services and the packages that are available to us and have been tailored to us to whichever venue we go to.\"\nTruphone also provides users with local support if there are problems with devices, something that is very important to Caterham F1, as it is vital for every team member to be connected and have the correct equipment.\nPeters said: \"The service element is absolutely critical to us. The support we\u2019re getting trackside is excellent; it\u2019s not just about taking the battery out and put it back in again.\"\nCombined with mobile telecommunications is the need for Wi-Fi and data transfer. Caterham has installed a Motorola Wi-Fi network throughout its headquarters in Oxfordshire. Caterham has future plans to use Wi-Fi as part of a wider bring your own device (BYOD) strategy.\nThe security of the network was as important as speed in this case, as a lot of sensitive data about Caterham\u2019s cars can be passed across the network.\nThe network, which was deployed by Toranet, provides wireless intrusion protection system for Caterham's Wi-Fi network, as well as features to enhance the quality of data sharing including network traffic prioritisation and Smart RF.\nThe Caterham team is constantly doing what it can to shave time off of lap speed, including rapid-prototyping of parts with laser printers and constant monitoring of driving data.\nFaults or updates are transferred from the team trackside to engineers back in the Caterham headquarters in Oxfordshire. With last year\u2019s season spanning 19 countries, it\u2019s apparent why a reliable telecommunications system is integral to Caterham\u2019s success.", "Toronto FC midfielder Benoit Cheyrou (8) tackles Montreal Impact forward Didier Drogba (11) during the second half at Saputo Stadium in Montreal, Canada on Thursday, Oct. 29, 2015.\nGood news; the first Major League Soccer playoff game held on Canadian turf \u2013 kickoff temperature was 8 C and falling \u2013 was a rousing success.\nJust not for Toronto FC, the club that has invested more than anyone into its three designated players ($18.3-million U.S. this year).\nToronto FC fans have waited nine years to see their team play in the postseason, but they'll have to wait at least one more to see it win there. The Montreal Impact won the single-game playoff knockout 3-0 on Thursday night.\nThe atmosphere for the first all-Canadian MLS playoff match was equal to the occasion despite a smattering of empty seats.\nThe small contingent of travelling supporters wedged into a half-empty section in the northeast corner of Saputo Stadium had early cause to cheer as their team controlled play.\nToronto's leading lights \u2013 Sebastian Giovinco, Jozy Altidore, midfielder Michael Bradley \u2013 put in decent shifts, but the same cannot be said about the back line.\nImpact striker Didier Drogba, another of MLS's big earners, had said after last weekend's regular-season finale between the teams \u2013 a 2-1 Montreal win that sealed home field for Thursday's playoff rematch \u2013 that TFC \"is the better team on paper.\"\nOn the pitch? Not this night. Montreal scored three times in the first half, and it could have been worse.\n\"We found ourselves up against it quickly \u2026 we just got outcompeted in the first half,\" Toronto coach Greg Vanney said.\nMontreal advances to face the Columbus Crew on Sunday, while TFC undertakes a winter of contemplation and rues what might have been.\n\"I thought we were tentative, we were a little bit hesitant maybe to close people down, to get tight to people. We were second to loose balls \u2026 and we made some poor decisions defensively,\" Vanney said.\nIt would be easy to consider Thursday's game as a referendum on TFC's off-season spending, the bulk of it on Giovinco and Altidore, but the fact is Toronto ran into a threshing machine at Saputo Stadium.\n\"One of our best performances of the year,\" Impact coach Mauro Biello said.\nIt was piloted in turn by the industry of hometown midfielder Patrice Bernier, silky Argentine forward Ignacio Piatti and \u2013 him again \u2013 Drogba.\nToronto's game plan evidently centred on smothering Drogba and Piatti. TFC can be forgiven for not devising a specific strategy for Bernier.\nThe 36-year-old veteran was exiled to the end of the first-team bench as recently as August. Since coach Frank Klopas was fired eight weeks ago (after a loss to Toronto) and replaced by his assistant Biello, Bernier has enjoyed a renaissance of sorts, mostly from the bench.\nBiello said he decided after Sunday's game Bernier should start. It was an inspired tactical move.\nBernier signalled early that he'd come to play, committing a nice bit of thievery on Bradley in the centre of the pitch in the seventh minute that set off a counterattack.\nBy then, Piatti had already won a free kick wriggling down the left. Shortly afterward Giovinco got his first look at goal on a ball over the top, although Evan Bush was equal to the task in the Montreal goal.\nIn the 19th minute, Montreal counterattacked from its own penalty area.\nNigel Reo-Coker slid a pass just beyond the outstretched foot of Brazilian midfielder Jackson; Piatti romped forward and sent a delicate ball in behind defender Josh Williams, which Bernier latched on to and walloped low to Toronto goalie Chris Konopka's left and into the corner of the net.\nThe huge silver bell set up behind the visiting net began to toll as Bernier thumped his chest.\nFifteen minutes later, Piatti made it 2-0 when he pounced on a defensive miscue \u2013 Williams slipped just as Ahmed Kantari passed the ball to him across the top of the 18-yard box.\nAnd five minutes after that, Piatti was again instrumental in the build-up as Bernier took a through-ball and skimmed a left-footed pass through four defenders to Drogba. The former Chelsea striker, forced from the field earlier after taking a knock, calmly side-footed his 12th goal in as many games since coming to North America this summer.\nIn the second half, TFC again started with purpose, and Giovinco, the prohibitive favourite for league MVP, struck a beautiful free kick from a central position that Bush somehow clawed off his goal line.\nThere would be other chances, but Piatti nearly made it 4-0 when he clanged a shot off the post in the 79th minute.\nAs the clock wound down the Toronto supporters expressed their displeasure at having their number severely limited after problems with flares and smoke bombs on Sunday.\nAfter enduring derisive chants of \"na, na, goodbye\" from the home fans they stood and cheered after the final whistle as the downcast players in red filed past for a final goodbye.", "The bipartisan Surveillance State Repeal Act, if passed, would repeal dragnet surveillance of Americans\u2019 personal communications, overhaul the federal domestic surveillance program, and provide protections for whistleblowers.\nHouse lawmakers Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) are co-sponsoring bill H.R.1466, which was introduced on Tuesday and would repeal the 2001 Patriot Act, limit powers of the FISA Amendments Act, and prohibit retaliation against federal national security whistleblowers, according to The Hill.\nSpecifically, the bill would revoke all the powers of the Patriot Act, and instruct the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to destroy any information collected under the FISA Amendments Act concerning any US person not under investigation.\nIt would repeal provisions of the FISA Amendments Act to ensure surveillance of email data only occurs with a valid warrant based on probable cause.

But there\u2019s one quality we almost never talk about. It may not be a must-have for success, but I\u2019ve found it to be a really-good-to-have.\nAnd that\u2019s a sense of humor.\nHumor is very rarely talked about as a management tool. This is despite the fact that it \u201creduces hostility, deflects criticism, relieves tension, improves morale and helps communicate difficult messages,\u201d according to a Harvard Business Review article. Not bad. And studies cited in that same Harvard article noted that executives who use humor more often are more likely to be ranked as outstanding.\nOf course, there\u2019s a difference between awkward and harassment. Believe me, as a woman in business, I\u2019ve seen plenty of times when someone says or does something so out of line that you should take it up with a supervisor or human resources. There\u2019s nothing funny about that.\nThere have been some awkward, potentially sexist situations I\u2019ve faced in the past.\nSome examples: I\u2019m told to fetch a cup of coffee for the men in a meeting. I\u2019m asked by a financial advisor in a big branch meeting how in the world I can be qualified to run Merrill Lynch. One of my colleagues lets me know in a meeting that the other parents at my daughter\u2019s school told him I had missed the kids\u2019 paperback book fair. The list goes on.\nAnd when faced with these embarrassing moments, you ask yourself: How do I handle this?\nTime for a well-placed zinger? Maybe an icy stare? A somber discussion of the inappropriateness of the comment, question or action?\nInstead I\u2019ve almost always opted for humor. When the financial advisor asked me if I was qualified to run Merrill, I began to act like I was in a job interview, detailing my credentials and references, then asking him if I could have the job. Not Amy Schumer stuff by any means, but it let the air out of the room and gave us a graceful way out of a tense moment. Humor can quickly put us on the same \u201cside of the table,\u201d laughing together about something. It would have been very different if I had gotten my back up.\nTo get to grace, for years I\u2019ve employed what I call \u201cMRI\u201d\u2014Most Respectful Interpretation\u2014of others\u2019 actions. By that view, the Merrill financial advisor wasn\u2019t being rude to me simply to be rude to me; he was being protective of Merrill, a company at which he\u2019d worked his entire life. The guy who asked for coffee was doing so because he rarely saw women in executive positions; the fellow who mentioned that I had missed the paperback book fair\u2026ok, he was a dope. But there could have been something well meaning in there.\nIs it fair that I was put in these situations? No. Was it fair that I had to figure out how to navigate them, pretty much on my own\u2026since no (male) boss of mine was ever asked to get coffee?

I'm hopeful that they'll continue to get better.\"\nMore than anything, the group helped keep the Saints' pass rush at bay. Not having defenders draped on his back off the snap like last year, Bradford was able to pick apart the New Orleans with deep strikes -- averaging 22.2 air distance per completion (third highest in Week 1), per Next Gen Stats. The maligned QB also passed for a 9.6 air yards per attempt in the final three quarters.\n\"Like I said, all off season in the building we feel great about those guys up front,\" Bradford said of his blocking. \"We've seen it during OTAs, we've seen it during training camp. I know we didn't play great as an offense during the preseason games. We've seen what we're capable of doing. I think those guys came out tonight. I think we had a good week of preparation.\n\"Like I said, we weren't really sure what to expect tonight. We talked a lot about playing by rule and making sure we were on the same page. Those guys up front they did a good job all week just making sure they were prepared. I think it showed tonight. They played fast, they played confident, we were in and out of the huddle, the tempo was great tonight, we were getting to the line early. I think we put pressure on them.\"\nThe Vikings entered the season with plenty of skepticism in their most recent attempt to rebuild the offensive line. Reiff and Remmers were both veterans without phenomenal game tape, whose previous teams did little to retain. Elflein, a third-round pick, was the first rookie to start at center since Mick Tingelhoff, back in the Year of Our Lord, 1962.\nReiff, in particular, was a rock on Bradford's blind side Monday, allowing zero hurries. Elfein displayed athleticism from the pivot that will bode well for Cook on outside runs this season.\nThe caveat you've been waiting for: It was against the Saints defense.\nYes, New Orleans trotted out a putrid D redux, but the characteristics the Vikings displayed Monday are transferable.\nThere will surely be some stumbling blocks for the remade offensive line as we play the next 15 games. But for one night, the group looked sturdy and Bradford took advantage. If the biggest weakness on a team that disappointed in 2016 is finally plugged, Minnesota will be a force in the NFC.", "Cong talks about \u2018big heart\u2019\u2026Whose \u2018big heart\u2019 helped Robert Vadra to establish his empire? questioned BJP.\nHours after Priyanka Gandhi Vadra hit out at Narendra Modi again, the BJP Sunday launched its sharpest attack against her husband, releasing a strongly worded booklet and video targeting Robert Vadra.\nTitled \u2018Damaad Shri\u2019, the nearly 8-minute video accuses the Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led government in Haryana and the previous Ashok Gehlot-led regime in Rajasthan of helping Vadra grab land across the two states in violation of rules.\nThe video shows a snazzily dressed Vadra riding a fancy bike and working out, contrasting it with poverty-struck farmers whose land had been taken by him. The video accuses Sonia and Rahul Gandhi of facilitating the illegal land deals for Vadra. The six-page booklet, also titled \u2018Damaad Shri\u2019, talks about his various land deals.\n\u201cThere was gross violation of laws relating to land and environment. Robert Vadra after Haryana went straight to Rajasthan. The previous Congress government of Rajasthan helped him by violating laws,\u201d BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said releasing the booklet attacking Vadra.\nWith polling in Rae Bareli just two days away, Priyanka earlier fired the first salvo of the day on Sunday. \u201cYeh Bharat desh hai jise chalane ke liye chhappan inch ka seena nahin, dariyadil chahiye. Satta ka kroor bal nahi, naitik shakti chahiye (This is India. To run this country, what is needed is not a 56-inch chest but a big heart. Not the cruel might of power but moral authority). Instead of hollow and superficial showcase of capabilities, this country requires internal determination, where one is ready to die to save its culture,\u201d she said in Rajamau village of Rae Bareli.\nThe party also claimed that its target was not personal or limited to a family but the larger issue of corruption. \u201cSo far no serious attempt has been made by the Congress to defend Vadra,\u201d Ravi Shankar Prasad said. \u201cI did not even ask questions of Priyanka Gandhi. My questions were aimed at Sonia and Rahul Gandhi and we wanted to know how a person by merely investing Rs 1 lakh can earn Rs 300 crore.\u201d He added that he did not want to join issue with Priyanka on her language.\nOn Sonia\u2019s claim that Modi was promising to make India a paradise, the BJP prime ministerial candidate said he did not make any such claims and people did not expect that from him.\nEarlier, Priyanka faced mild protests in Ichauli in Rae Bareli during her campaigning, from people carrying BJP flags and seeking to know why their MP Sonia hadn\u2019t come. \u201cWe have seen enough of you, go back. We want answers from our MP, who is Sonia Gandhi. We want development, we want electricity, we want roads,\u201d shouted some.\nLater, at a public meeting nearby, Priyanka clarified that Sonia was campaigning in the rest of the country and had thus sent her to speak about \u201csignificant political issues affecting the country\u201d.", "JURGEN KLOPP has hailed Maurizio Sarri for hitting the ground running at Chelsea.\nLiverpool host the Blues at Anfield in the third round of the Carabao Cup tonight before the Reds visit Stamford Bridge in the Premier League on Sunday.\nKlopp\u2019s men sit top of the table with a flawless record after seven games, while Chelsea lost their 100 per cent record on Sunday with a goalless draw at West Ham.\nBut Klopp has been surprised at how quickly former Napoli boss Sarri has taken to the English game.\nKlopp said: \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest change I ever saw in such a short space of time - wow. The style is completely different. What a manager he is.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty much a supporter of his since I saw him at Naples.

All the rest, you have to wait until tomorrow. But it will be a good team, believe me.\n\u201cHe has been brilliant. It was as you can imagine - transfer window time is one of two moments in the year when you can make decisions about going somewhere and, yes, Simon would have been ready to go to another club, to be the number one, wherever in the world. That was clear.\n\u201cBut we couldn\u2019t do it, and since then he has been brilliant.\nKlopp has also called on his other fringe players to grasp their chance to impress.\nHe said: \u201cPlaying a game at 50 per cent would be a waste of time, would not make much sense. But I don\u2019t put pressure on each player who plays.\n\u201cI really see this opportunity.\n\u201cThe pressure is already there. If you don\u2019t perform, it\u2019s difficult to improve your situation. But the situation is nobody in this team at the moment is bad.

The mass detention of immigrant youth is reminiscent in some ways of mass incarceration of juveniles from times past.\nTwo decades ago, political scientist John DiIulio set off hysteria by warning of an impending influx of young \u201csuper-predators.\u201d His theory led to zero-tolerance policies, harsh sentences and, ultimately, the rise of mass incarceration of juveniles.\nHistory is repeating itself for immigrant youth, under President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocrats' CNN town halls exposed an extreme agenda Buttigieg says he doubts Sanders can win general election Post-Mueller, Trump has a good story to tell for 2020 MORE. His administration is vilifying them, calling some unaccompanied minors \u201cwolves in sheep\u2019s clothing,\u201d while the government detains children in unprecedented numbers for longer periods of time. Migrant children are often defenseless in immigration proceedings, since courts have not recognized their right to court-appointed counsel; this may change, depending on how the Ninth Circuit decides a recent case.\nMass detention of immigrant youth is partly caused by a decision from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency tasked with the care of unaccompanied minors, to share fingerprints of potential sponsors with immigration enforcement agencies. Recent reports reveal that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested close to 200 sponsors since April, sending a chilling effect through immigrant communities. While the administration has begun to backtrack on another policy of extreme vetting of other residents living with sponsors, they plan to continue sharing sponsors\u2019 information.\nAs a result, children are being held in detention longer \u2014 for an average of 57 days, up from 34 days in 2015. This might be the immigration agency\u2019s goal, so that children are transferred to adult jails on their 18th birthday, which happened to roughly 1,000 teenagers last year.\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is attacking existing child protections, such as the Flores settlement, which outlines minimum standards to ensure children\u2019s safety. Under Flores, the immigration agency must place children in the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d setting possible, releasing children \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d to family, a guardian or a licensed program. The administration hopes to implement new rules to end Flores, by allowing minors to be detained for longer periods of time and with fewer protections.\nAs an attorney for immigrant children, I\u2019ve seen firsthand what happens when youth \u2014 who often have experienced high levels of trauma \u2014 are detained. One of my clients, a teenager, started wetting his bed while in detention. There have been countless reports of dire consequences for children. Some have been molested; one child lost a third of his body weight; and an 18-month-old toddler died weeks after being detained, reportedly because of inadequate medical care.\nThe harm lasts much longer than their stay in detention. Research shows the intense stress that detained children face can disrupt \u201clearning, behavior, immunity, growth, hormonal systems, immune systems and even the DNA.\u201d Childhood trauma may lead to a range of health complications into adulthood, such as heart problems, cancer, stroke, diabetes, liver disease and skeletal fractures.\nThe government speculates detention will deter unauthorized migration. In fact, data have shown that\u2019s not true. Perhaps this is because nearly 60 percent of children are fleeing violence and other serious harms, according to a United Nations study.\nThe administration also has raised concerns that children, if released, won\u2019t appear in court. Yet, there\u2019s a more humane and cost-effective way to ensure that children come to court. Although a majority of children appear regularly at their hearings, access to counsel makes attendance nearly perfect. According to data, 95 percent of children represented by lawyers attend their hearings. Yet in today\u2019s immigration courts, most children are unrepresented and, more and more, children are fighting immigration cases while living in detention, to the determinant of their legal cases and their health.\nIn the past decade, the juvenile justice landscape shifted dramatically with the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement that the state \u201ccannot proceed as though they [juveniles] were not children.\u201d The immigration system should follow suit, ensuring children are represented by attorneys and that they spend shorter, not longer, periods of time in detention.\nAs the Ninth Circuit reconsiders immigrant children\u2019s right to court-appointed attorneys, we must remember that immigrant children are simply children. Until courts recognize children\u2019s right to counsel, or Congress acts to protect kids, it is up to local and state governments to ensure that no child has to defend himself in immigration proceedings. To achieve more just, efficient and humane outcomes, we must end the mass incarceration of children and provide them appointed counsel in immigration court.\nLaila L.

The RNAA food and farming debate: From left: Jake Fiennes, Rob Ward, Anna Hill, Jon Duffy and Neil Punchard. Picture: Chris Hill.\nShould consumers and local community \u201chubs\u201d be given more say over how public money is spent on environmental work on farms?\nThat was one of the questions raised during a debate at the Royal Norfolk Show, where panellists discussed how farming can show it is \u201cbeing kind to the countryside\u201d.\nThe debate, chaired by BBC Radio 4 Farming Today presenter Anna Hill, featured Jake Fiennes, estate manager at Raveningham Estates, Neil Punchard, Broadland catchment partnership officer at the Broads Authority, Jon Duffy, chief executive at AF (Anglia Farmers) Group, and Rob Ward, co-founder at Grocery Accelerator.\nWith farm funding expected to be redirected away from land-based subsidies to a system of \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d like environmental work after Brexit, Mr Ward said there was an opportunity for emerging policies to create a radically new system of public involvement.\nThe consumer insights specialist said: \u201cIf we are going to pay a farmer for looking after the environment, that concerns me. The farmer is also a businessman. That is a conflict of interests, so it does not make sense to me.\nAmong the audience was Norfolk farmer and journalist David Richardson, a co-founder of LEAF (Linking Environment and Farming), who said: \u201cIt is naive to think we can get people off the streets of Norwich to take control of part of the farm, and do it in a way that does not conflict or cause more problems between themselves and a farmer trying to run the farm.\nMr Ward responded: \u201cIt is about enabling people to be a part of something, rather than telling them what it should be. I am not saying that farmers cannot do it, my issue is that people don\u2019t know about it.\nMr Fiennes, a conservationist who described himself as a land manager rather than a farmer, added: \u201cWe all need to engage with the public. But do I want volunteers on my farm, cutting my hay meadows? Can you imagine getting a risk assessment for that? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s workable.\n\u201cThere are some wonderful examples [of conservation] out there.

Photos: Courtesy.\nNavigating the crowded taco scene for National Taco Day.\nOctober 4 is National Taco Day, and while every day is more or less a taco day in on the Westside, here are four tacos on the Westside that stand out from the pack and are worth going next time you feel like making your normal day a taco day.\nTacos Por Favor keeps it simple, tasty and fresh. Sticking to this formula, the three locations (Santa Monica, Venice, West L.A.) have become the go-to place for many Westsiders seeking out a quick, no-frills taco. From carne asada, carnitas and chorizo to lengua, mahi-mahi and potato, the range of taco options are varied, but the tacos themselves are straightforward: meat (or veggie) on a tortilla that can be \u201csauced-up\u201d at the top-notch salsa bar. At under $3 a pop, one can walk out stuffed for $10 with three tacos, chips and salsa in their belly. And with enough salsa Roja, you will be wanting to spend a few more bucks and wash everything down with a horchata or Pacifico.\nTacos Por Favor is located at 1408 Olympic Blvd in Santa Monica, 1901 Olympic Blvd in West Los Angeles and 826 Hampton Dr in Venice.

With 14 different tacos to choose from, the sample platter of six mini tacos may be the best choice for those overwhelmed by the extensive menu. What ties the eclectic range of options together is pure deliciousness coupled with unique flavor combinations. For those looking something straightforward yet different, try the Steak Picado: flank steak simmered with green bell peppers and bacon, served with green serrano chile atop black beans. For heat seekers, the Cochinita Pibil is a must have. Shredded pork cooked in a sweet, red achiote spice atop black beans topped with pickled red onions and habanero chile, the Pibil spice level defaults at a three on a scale of 1-10 and can be increased for the brave of heart and palette. For those looking to indulge, try the Chicharron taco. The pork rinds simmered in Chile Verde will make all the traffic and honking horns worth it.\nGuisados West Hollywood is located at 8935 Santa Monica Blvd, West Hollywood, CA 90069.

This is about the only comparison one can make between these two tacos joints. The hard-shell tacos at Titos are essentially a different type of cuisine than the decadent, soft-shell tacos at Guisados. In 1992 Jonathan Gold wrote in the LA Times that \u201cTito\u2019s has the deeply nostalgic bean \u2018n\u2019 chip smell\u201d and in 2018 this has not changed.\nAlso unchanged is the simple menu at Tito\u2019s: tacos, enchiladas, tamales, two kinds of burritos (with or without beans), chile con carne, tostadas, rice and beans.

If not, the price tag (or lack thereof) on the tacos should convince even the wariest skeptic. Every taco at El Primo, whether it\u2019s Lengua, Cabeza, carne asada pastor, is $1.

He once compared EU officials to Soviet troops, and this year he did not mention by name some of his favorite targets of recent years, like European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Hungarian-American financier George Soros.\nOn Wednesday, Europe&apos;s main center-right group, the European People&apos;s Party, will debate the possible suspension or expulsion of Orban&apos;s ruling Fidesz party, requested for now by 13 of the EPP&apos;s 49 parties.\nAfter years of quarrels, some EPP members say Orban \u2014 who returned to power in 2010 and has become a role model for Europe&apos;s far-right for his anti-immigration, anti-European Union rhetoric and autocratic style \u2014 has strayed too far from Christian Democratic values.\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also spoke at Friday&apos;s commemoration, highlighting centuries of Polish-Hungarian friendship. Orban said last week that he would seek to form an alliance with Poland&apos;s ruling Law and Justice party, helmed by his ally Jaroslaw Kaczynski, if Fidesz is ousted from the EPP.", "A familiar face to Channel 3 viewers will hit the stage in Cleveland for a special musical event.\nCLEVELAND, BRADLEY COUNTY (WRCB) \u2013 A familiar face to Channel 3 viewers will hit the stage in Cleveland for a special musical event.\nClassic and modern big band, swing, Latin, and waltz tunes will fill the air and set toes to tapping in Johnston Park Friday night May 20th when Greg Glover and Sweet Georgia Sound take the stage.\nChattanooga&apos;s big band will appear on the Evening Shade stage in downtown Cleveland on Friday, May 20, in a free, family-friendly concert made possible by the Allied Arts Council of the Cleveland/Bradley Chamber of Commerce.\nThe concert is funded in part by local sponsors and under an agreement with the Tennessee Arts Commission.\nThe Sweet Georgia Sound is a 20-member ensemble that has entertained listening and dancing audiences in the tri-state area since 1994. Originally formed as part of the MidSouth Music Association, the band split off to become an independent group in 1998 and, under the directorship of Mike LaRoche since 2000, the band has reached new heights.\nStarting in 2002, Sweet Georgia Sound worked closely with the Chattanooga Downtown Partnership to produce the annual Swingfest music and dance event. This community event brings large swing bands and dancers together for a fun nonstop evening of dancing and music. Swingfest will be returning in 2011 bigger and better than ever.\nSweet Georgia Sound will return to Chattanooga&apos;s Riverbend Festival this year.

In this account, God grasped us by the hand and took us on a tour of creation to give us a purpose: be a light to others. This image of light is quite literal as Isaiah continues: \u201cOpening eyes deprived of light. Rescuing prisoners from confinement, from the dungeon of those who sit in darkness\u201d\u009d (42:7). Being a light to others means going to places of darkness and shedding the light of rescue and relief. Wherever there is darkness, strive to bring the light.\nWe recently re-opened Genesis and re-read the majestic story of creation. God was the Creator, all-powerful and distant. But in the second chapter, God invested the divine breath into the muddy form of man, imbuing human beings with sanctity, taking them from inanimate, powerless creatures to beings who\u2014with each exhalation\u2014were bringing the divine presence into the world. And when we finished reading Genesis about the creation of man and woman, we turned to Isaiah to understand not how we were formed but why.\nIt is there that Isaiah reminds us that God created light and then grasped us by the hand and showed us a world with many pockets of darkness. God called us a covenant people, meaning that we are to be partners in the act of creation. God created light in the world and created us. Now it is our turn to create the light. What are you doing to partner in the on-going creation and bring more light into the world?\nDr. Erica Brown (pictured, click to download) is a writer and educator who works as the scholar-in-residence for the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington and consults for the Jewish Agency and other Jewish non-profits.

They held their first workshop in Mongolia with the help of Internews and Earth Journalism Network.\nCurrently, OpenAQ collects data from 11 countries, and has over a million data records and they\u2019re still expanding.\nLeading air quality researchers in the nation, anthropologists, urban planners, journalists and software developers participated in the workshop to find solution to the data gap between researchers and the media.\nOn day one, the workshop participants learned to access the OpenAQ platform and brainstormed ways to utilize the data from the platform, such as forming comparative graphs and using the findings to make software and hardware. An idea to install LED lights on trees which will act as an indicator of air pollution levels received the support of many. It urges parents to carry their children above those LED lighted levels to decrease the impact of pollution.\nDay two focused on brainstorming and expanding on the previously proposed ideas, and developing the mechanism that links media with scientists. Researchers from Mongolia and the U.S. gave speeches on the importance of raw-data and its usage in raising public awareness.\nDoctors from the School of Public Health at the National University of Medicine G.Enkhjargal and L.Munkh-Erdene spoke about the health dangers and mortality rates of those suffering from diseases associated to air pollution, as well as its macro-economic effects. Dr. Lodoisamba from the German-Mongolian Institute for Resources and Technology presented his ongoing research about the difference of how much air pollution a person is exposed to depending on their environment. Dr. Langley Dewitt, Dr. Sachin Shah, and Dr. Dewitt, an MIT scholar working in Rwanda, spoke about how installing one monitoring station in the rural area revealed that air pollution levels could be high in a non-urban area, which changed the way the world looks at air pollution.\nOn the final day, participants integrated all the ideas and came up with three priorities for resolving air pollution issues in Ulaanbaatar. The first was to raise public awareness through a daily notification system about air pollution levels. Secondly, including lessons about air quality in the Mongolian secondary education curriculum. The education curriculum is expected bring awareness of the problem to younger generations.\n\u201cWe targeted children, as they are one of the most at-risk groups, and their behaviors can be changed easily,\u201d said British anthropologist and urban planner Alex Skinner.\nThe last group discussed to create a directory website to make data from scientific studies accessible to journalists and scientists that incorporates user-friendly graphs and by hosting discussion forums.\nSoftware developer B.Dulguun has unveiled a prototype of a user-friendly interface that operates on the OpenAQ platform, and a map of all the available geo-tagged sites in the platform.\nEnkhbolor Gantulga, an ICT and economic consultant at the World Bank Mongolia, invited attendees to introduce the priority ideas at the next Green Nation Challenge event, which promotes social entrepreneurship in Mongolia.\nThe following is a short interview with the co-founder of OpenAQ Joseph Flasher about the importance of open data.\nWhy did you decide to build this platform?\nMany countries make their own air quality data open. But each country has their own index and measure air quality differently, so it\u2019s harder to make comparisons and studies based on it. Nobody is making and standardizing one source for all of the global data. So we decided to do it.\nWhy is it important to have open air quality data?\nThe real value is in allowing other people to build tools on top of it. We don\u2019t think we can create one site that works for everyone. Rather than relying on one website to work for everyone, we\u2019re making the data open so that anyone can build the tool that satisfies and fulfills their most demanding need.\nHow will other countries benefit from Ulaanbaatar\u2019s experience?\nOpen data helps everyone. Sharing all the world\u2019s data will allow people in other countries to look at problems in different countries. Different cities that have similar air pollution issues can compare each others\u2019 data and exchange experiences and work together in battling air pollution. Ulaanbaatar has the same air pollution and car problems as Shenzheng and Hohhot, China. By getting their data online, it allows scientists elsewhere to try and solve the problems there and if it works there, it might also work in UB, or vice versa.\nWhat were your expectations from the workshop?\nI expected to get a smart, dedicated group of people together and have them share ideas. I wanted them to learn about the OpenAQ platform and be excited about what we were doing. My expectations were more than fulfilled. Everyone understood why we were doing it and were supportive. Even though I\u2019m leaving to America, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m leaving behind a very vibrant community.\nWhat are your plans in the long-run?\nIn the long-run, we want to build a platform that allows anyone who wants it to freely access the world air quality data. We\u2019ve already started building that, but we need more stations and more people to build things on top of the data to get the message out there to everyone.\nPosted by The UB Post on Nov 27 2015.

Pinging is currently not allowed.\nopenAQ has the responsiblity to make the air pollution in the capital cities better than the ones that are in the rural areas. This is not so difficult with the open data that is now available for the user to make the LED lights in the right places on the tree to carry the children above.\nSo now we have perfect data, but what are we going to DO with them? Just look at them and shake our heads?\nWe can use this data with others to show the real impact to Mongolians, their health, and their economy. One data set in a vacuum doesn\u2019t explain much, but what if we mapped this with hospital reports, weather patterns, etc? There are so many tools out there, someone just needs to use them.", "The third annual Everybody\u2019s Formal, which is hosted by the Associated Student Body, is being sponsored primarily by Greek life organizations. ASB was still reaching out to potential sponsors the day before the formal.\nThe official sponsors for the event listed on ASB\u2019s Facebook page are College Panhellenic Council, Fraternal Leadership & Learning, Kappa Sigma fraternity, Ole Miss Men\u2019s Basketball, Special Projects coordinator Linda Spargo, the Office of the Chancellor, the Division of Administration and Finance and the Division of Student Affairs. ASB President Elam Miller is a member of Ole Miss\u2019 Delta Xi chapter of Kappa Sigma fraternity.\nMiller said ASB doesn\u2019t have a list of everyone who was asked to be a sponsor and that the organization brought in other people to collect sponsorships who normally wouldn\u2019t be helping find sponsors because ASB was \u201cshort of money\u201d for the formal.\nMiller said he approached people in class and in passing to ask about sponsoring the event.\nMullins is the president of Beta Theta Pi fraternity.\nThe planning committee for Everybody\u2019s Formal was led by initiative director Kelsea White. White, who is a member of Ole Miss Alpha Mu chapter of Kappa Delta sorority, appointed a team of associate directors that was made up of Danielle Foster, Georgia Summer and Sally Rychlak, all of whom are members of Ole Miss\u2019 Alpha Delta chapter of Phi Mu sorority.\nWhite said this was her first year being a part of ASB and that she took on the position when Miller approached her in August. She said Miller wanted to create a different management structure for Everybody\u2019s Formal, so there wasn\u2019t a formal application process for the directors of the event.\nCollege Panhellenic Council President Ann Weston Sistrunk said Miller reached out in September to ask if the group would like to help sponsor the event and that \u201cas a council who advocates for student experience and leadership on this campus,\u201d the council agreed.\nMinutes from the latest ASB Executive Council meeting indicate that planning and acquiring sponsors for the formal happened last-minute.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, two days before Everybody\u2019s Formal, some presidents of Interfraternity Council fraternities and National Pan-Hellenic Council sororities said they had not been contacted by ASB with the option to sponsor the event.\n\u201cNo one contacted us about sponsoring it, but we did get a message to attend,\u201d Delta Psi President Will Tribble said.\nPhi Kappa Tau President Jay Vaughn also said his fraternity chapter was not contacted about sponsoring the event on Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday morning, ASB Executive assistant Barker Fowler emailed IFC, Panhellenic and NPHC chapters to offer them the opportunity to sponsor Everybody\u2019s Formal. Fowler wrote that organization leaders would have to respond within an hour if they wanted their group\u2019s name on the official event banner.\n\u201cWe were contacted (Wednesday) for the first time, and it said respond within an hour. And by the time I saw it, it was too late,\u201d said Cellas Hayes, the president of the Ole Miss Eta Beta chapter of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.\nPresident of the Ole Miss Lambda Sigma chapter of Delta Sigma Theta, Kaylyndzeyia Gray, also confirmed that her sorority received an email about sponsoring Everybody\u2019s Formal and was given an hour-long deadline to respond on Wednesday.", "Jan. 19, 2017, 4 p.m.\nFujifilm was the belle of the Photokina ball thanks to its announcement of the GFX 50S mirrorless medium format camera. It's only the second camera of its type announced, coming on the heels of Hasselblad's X1D, and Fujifilm's track record and promise of affordability piqued the interest of photographers worldwide.\nToday the GFX 50S is an official thing, with a release date and price, along with more detailed specifications than we learned in Germany. To recap, it uses a custom 51.4MP medium format sensor, about 33 by 44mm in size, which is about 1.7 times the size of a 35mm film frame. As with other medium format cameras, including the Pentax 645Z and Hasselblad H6D-50c, this sensor format promises to deliver an advantage when it comes to depth of field control and overall image quality.\nThe GFX's body is sealed against dust and moisture, and it sports a two-axis hinged 3.2-inch LCD, similar to the one that Fujifilm uses on its X-T2. There's also an EVF, which is removable by doesn't look like its should be, and an add-on accessory that can sit between the EVF and camera to change its fixed-position design to an articulating one.\nOther modern features include Fuji's bevy of film emulation modes, Wi-Fi for image transfer and remote control, USB 3.0 for tethered operation, and a fully electronic shutter option. The camera does sport an in-body focal plane shutter, but Fuji plans to support third-party leaf shutter lenses via mount adapters. An adapter for Hasselblad H lenses will be available at launch and support flash sync at 1/800-second.\nThe image sensor isn't an X-Trans design, a differentiating factor that sets Fuji's mirrorless APS-C line apart from its rivals. Instead the company opted for a traditional Bayer color filter for the GFX. Video is supported, with 1080p as the ceiling at up to 30fps, and the same film simulation modes that work with stills can be applied to video in-camera.\nFuji initially planned on selling the GFX 50S in a kit with the standard-angle 63mm F2.8 lens. That has changed. Instead the camera is going to sell as a body only when it ships in February, priced at just $6,499.95 in the US and $8,499.99 in Canada.\nYou'll have a choice of one of three lenses to purchase at launch. The GF 63mm F2.8 R WR ($1,499.95 US, or $1,899.99 Canada) is a standard prime with a wide (for medium format) f/2.8 aperture. It's joined by the GF 32-64mm F4 R LM WR ($2,299.95 US or $2,999.99 Canada) wide-angle zoom and GF 120mm F4 R LM OIS WR Macro ($2,699.96 US or $3,499.99 Canada).\nThree more lenses are coming later in 2017. They are the GF 110m F2 R LM WR, which has a focal length and aperture that should make for killer portraits, the ultra-wide GF 23mm F4 R LM WR, and the moderate wide-angle GF 45mm F2.8 R WR. Pricing for these has not yet been set.\nIn addition to the GFX 50S, Fujifilm is updating a couple of its more popular consumer-friendly camera.\nThe X-T20 is the follow-up to the X-T10. Like its predecessor it packs much of the tech from the current flagship X model, the X-T2, and puts it in a more compact, more affordable package. This includes a 24.3MP X-Trans III image sensor, a touch-screen rear display, a built-in EVF, a 91-point focus system with phase and contrast detection technology, and 4K video capture.\nThe X-T20 has a modest 5fps capture rate, less than the 8fps supported by the X-T2, but it does maintain protection from dust and inclement weather. It's priced at $899.95 in the US and $1,199.99 in Canada as a body only, and will ship in February. It will sell in silver or black.\nThere are a couple of kit options, including one with the XF 18-55mm ($1,199.95 US or $1,599.99 Canada) and another with the XC 16-50mm ($999.95 US or $1,299.99 Canada).\nFujifilm is also announcing a new X lens, the XF 50mm F2 R WR. It joins the 35mm F2 and 23mm F2 in the lineup of weather-sealed, low-cost, f/2 prime lenses for the system. It ships in February for $449.95 in the US and $649.99 in Canada.\nLast but not least, the X100T is getting an update in the form of the X100F. It's not a major overhaul to the popular fixed-lens compact. It maintains the same body design, complete with hybrid electronic/optical viewfinder, and 23mm F2 (35mm full-frame equivalent) fixed lens.\nThe big change is the sensor, it's now the 24.3MP X-Trans III APS-C chip used in the X-T20, X-T2, and X-Pro2. That's a welcome update from the aging 16MP resolution offered by the X100T. The black-and-white Acros option has been added to the film emulation modes, just like with the current crop of 24MP Fuji cameras.\nThe rear has been redesigned. The display is now flush with the left side, and there are fewer buttons overall\u2014but there is a joystick to quickly change focus points, a welcome addition. And, as with the the X-T20, the X100F sports a hybrid focus system with 91 points.\nThe X100F ships in February. It's priced at $1,299.95 in the US and $1,699.99 in Canada. Like the X-T20, it's going to sell in your choice of silver or black.", "To the victor, all of the spoils. That\u2019s why an ebullient, confident Jeremy Corbyn was able to calibrate before conference the precise nature of the relationship he will have with those who cackhandedly sought to depose him.\nWe will do as you wish, he told them right at the outset. We will, under my leadership, actually identify the goal of winning an election. Most of all, he said, the party was about \u201cwinning power in local and national government to deliver the real change our country so desperately needs\u201d.\nBut if Corbyn confirmed for them a pleasing destination, he also made it clear that they would be undertaking the journey on his route. If their brand of unity depended on Corbyn listening to them and adapting his line on immigration or defence to assuage their fears, that, it became clear, wasn\u2019t going to happen.\nStill, there was much they could sign up to. They might balk at the renationalisation of the railways and the politically difficult repeal of the Trade Union Act, but he threw in crowd-pleasers for right and left: a national education service, a national investment bank, more housing, curbs on tax avoidance and a school pupil arts premium.\nThis was a Corbyn a world away from the hesitancy of his speech last year. He joshed with the audience. He connected with the campaigners of Hillsborough. He deployed a talent for comedic pauses and shrugs.\nThere was Tory-bashing, during which his smooth tone ascended to a growl. There was personal testimony, about his parents and his time spent in Jamaica. Here was a man who doesn\u2019t do normal politics \u2013 but this looked very much like it.\nBut above all there was a message: a repeated rebuttal of the claim that Corbynism, by definition or perhaps design, equals electoral oblivion. I can win; I want to win; I see the need to win, he said. If critics believe that, they may acquiesce yet.\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s great hero Tony Benn always decried the media\u2019s interest in personality and style, wishing they would concentrate instead on substance and policy \u2013 the things he was teased for calling \u201cthe ishoos\u201d. So, in that spirit, the proper focus for any analysis of Corbyn\u2019s speech to the Labour party conference should be on the detail of what he said rather than the way he said it.\nWhich is a pity, because it was in the previously vexed matter of presentation that the leader did rather well. This was easily the most confident Corbyn performance to date, his delivery fluent and strong. Only occasionally did the emphasis stray on to the wrong syllable. Most of the time he looked relaxed in front of the Autocue rather than terrified, as he had this time last year. There was an (admittedly brief) personal passage about his upbringing, a couple of stirring quotations, even something close to a joke. All those appearances before adoring crowds over the summer have clearly helped.\nBut as a good Bennite, Corbyn will obviously be uninterested in such trivia. So on to the substance. The speech was aimed chiefly at the Labour tribe, hoping to unite those who have been fighting each other so bitterly.\nHe also sought to remind those in the hall of what they had in common, hitting those ideological notes that are more or less uncontroversial. So he played the reliable keys of opposition to grammar schools; rail nationalisation; giving councils the power to borrow to build homes; and investment in manufacturing, engineering and innovation. There were some new policy nuggets that he knew would go down well too, such as an arts pupil premium for lessons in music, dance or painting.\nWhat was missing was the presentation of a case to the wider Labour electorate, let alone to those people who voted Tory in 2015 and who will have to be won over if Labour is ever to return to power again.\nCorbyn barely addressed himself to the Labour voters who voted leave in the referendum, except for telling them that they are wrong to be so opposed to immigration, and the source of their woes lies elsewhere. That\u2019s a legitimate case to make \u2013 of course it is. But it takes more than a few paragraphs \u2013 and it meant his later insistence that \u201cwe must hear [the] concerns\u201don immigration of those left-behind voters rang hollow.\nSo Corbyn\u2019s team can congratulate themselves on a good afternoon. But the task confronting them is so much larger.\nThe speech confirmed two things about Jeremy Corbyn. The first is that he is not a great orator. He stumbled a few times on the Autocue and looked awkward at times. Presentation really needs to be improved if he is to reach out to the wider electorate. The second is that, right now, he is the only game in town.\nOne of the things the Brexit vote revealed is that for millions of people in this country the status quo has become intolerable. Corbyn represents the only strand of the Labour party that can respond to that sentiment; it\u2019s the only one radical enough.\nAnd respond Corbyn did. He said the system was broken. He channelled people\u2019s anger. He promised an ambitious new settlement for the 21st century.\nThe policies he listed were genuinely exciting: from renationalising the railways to a humanitarian foreign policy and repealing the Trade Union Act. Here was a leader on the side of the little guy, a leader who at least understands the challenges of the era.\nOf course, one of the biggest tasks for Corbyn in the coming months is to convince a jaded and angry electorate that he will make good on his stated ambition. The public is suspicious of politicians after decades of broken promises, and pessimistic about the possibility of politics to change the world after having their expectations lowered by the Cameron government\u2019s austerity rhetoric. And yes, Labour infighting and bad media management means the public will have questions about Corbyn\u2019s competence too.\nBut Corbyn and his team should rise to these challenges with gusto. We haven\u2019t heard a mainstream politician talk like this for years. I even dared to feel a little optimistic.\nMore fluent than last year, but miles off actual oratory; snappier lines, but hardly an epigrammatist \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn is never going to conform to the lobby\u2019s platonic ideal of what a politician should be. No memorised speeches or walkabouts on stage here. I always suspected that Ed Miliband psyched himself up for a big speech by watching box sets of The West Wing. I\u2019d be surprised if Corbyn has even heard of Jed Bartlet.\nBut at the heart of today\u2019s speech Corbyn was making a big new argument, one I haven\u2019t heard from a Labour leader\u2019s speech in my entire working life. In just over a year, the Labour party has gone from a being desiccated husk of worn-down old leftists and elbows-out young Blairites to being a mass movement. At half a million members, it is the biggest party in Europe \u2013 at a time when other political parties are dying. To use business terminology, we have witnessed something akin to a reverse takeover of the Labour party. It is incomplete and it is certainly contested, but it is real.\nAnd what the head of this new movement \u2013 confirmed as its leader twice in 12 months \u2013 was sketching out today was the potential for a social movement in electoral politics. By invoking the victories of Sadiq Khan in London and Marvin Rees in Bristol, he was showing that a social movement can yield victory at the ballot box.\nThis will be the central argument within Labour until the next general election. The press and politicians have spent the past year asking whether this hitherto obscure backbencher can actually lead a party. Well, they\u2019ve got their answer now, even if it\u2019s not the one they\u2019d have liked. The question is: how far can a social movement go? It\u2019s what I kept hearing this week at the Momentum gathering in Liverpool, and sooner or later the keepers of the old orthodoxy will have to start grappling with it.\nOne last point: in 2016, Corbyn is one of a handful of prominent politicians willing to defend migrants. That in itself is a commendation for the man \u2013 but it\u2019s also an indictment of the rest. When bright people within Labour are making their own Rivers of Blood-style speeches, I really do despair.\nWell-delivered, it was the best of Corbyn; and it was the worst of Corbyn. His followers will see the best, in the unbending principles of an unworldly leader refusing to stoop for mere electoral advantage \u2013 and never more honourably than over immigration.\nEven if it tops voter concerns, here was no truck with populist, anti-foreigner sentiment, despite the foghorn Brexit vote: no immigration controls, no arbitrary limit on numbers. \u201cIt isn\u2019t migrants that drive down wages. It\u2019s exploitative employers.\u201d Quite right.\nBut he takes his party with him on a jaw-dropping kamikaze mission, in the current climate. Where his wiser MPs talk of reasonable controls without courting Ukippery, Corbyn goes for martyrdom. A lifetime spent in Islington\u2019s liberal multicultural haven, he sees less than they of the wrath, the sense of loss, the patriotic identity crisis of Labour voters who feel their culture and good nature is imposed on. He is right: in places most afraid of immigration, numbers are mainly lowest \u2013 and voters wrongly blame migrants for all the effects of austerity cuts to schools, NHS and housing. But being right won\u2019t stop his party being blown down by a hurricane of contrary public opinion.\nThat\u2019s just the tailwind of Britain\u2019s great national crisis. Where was Corbyn\u2019s plan \u2013 even a vague outline \u2013 of how Britain should negotiate Brexit? As the government splits into fragments over this, Labour needs a forensic and united strategy for holding Theresa May to account for delivering the best possible terms. But with nothing from the leadership, his MPs are all over the place too on Brexit and immigration.\nNow for the worst of Corbynism: he calls for party unity \u2013 and there was plenty here for all to rally round on housing, schools, investment and much more. But demanding no \u201ctrench warfare\u201d from his opponents, he offered not one word of protection to MPs beleaguered by his shock troops in their constituencies. The man of peace should have called off the dogs of deselection.\nEndless meetings about antisemitism, Jeremy Corbyn fan poetry and a plot arc straight out of Hollywood \u2013 this year\u2019s party conference was in a world of its own.

I would look to be a buyer in the coming weeks in the $44 to $42 area, risking a weekly close below $41.\"\nMore than a year later, we can look back and see it was pretty good advice as prices did correct and then turn much higher. After two strong legs to the upside, the indicators are wavering a little and a new strategy is necessary.\nIn this daily bar chart of AGCO, above, we can see how prices have pulled back this month to close below the rising 50-day moving average line. Prices came close to the rising 200-day moving average line earlier today, but they have firmed. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has turned lower the past few weeks, signaling more aggressive selling. In the bottom panel, the 12-day momentum study has made lower highs from May to July as prices have made higher highs. These two paths describe a bearish divergence and probably foreshadowed the current price weakness.\nIn this weekly chart of AGCO, above, you can see prices are still well above the rising 40-week moving average line. The OBV line on this weekly timeframe is still positive, but the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is crossing to the downside above the zero line -- a take-profits sell signal.\nIn this Point and Figure chart of AGCO, above, we can see the August selloff and a possible downside price target of $56.\nBottom line: AGCO is trying to reverse its weak performance today but it may fail. If prices see renewed selling next week and close below the 200-day moving average line, we could weaken to the Point and Figure target of $56.

Investors tend to flock to consumer staples stocks in times of trouble because of consistent demand and dependable dividend yields.\nRich Ross, head of technical analysis at Evercore ISI, sees one other reason to own the S&P consumer staples ETF: the chart of XLP has recently broken above a key technical level, which may signal more gains to come.\n\"You probably can't do much better than owning the staples on this breakout from a multiyear trading range ... against the backdrop of a world where yields are extremely low,\" Ross said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"To me that's a winning combination in a world of heightened macro volatility.\"\nOn the other hand, Ross noted that continued strength in consumer staples stocks may be bad news for the overall market.\n\"The fact [that consumer staples is] hitting an all-time high is not exactly a ringing endorsement for risk taking or the market more broadly,\" he said.\nWhen it comes to those stocks specifically, they are actually trading at a notably high valuation right now, warned Erin Gibbs, chief equity investment officer at S&P Investment Advisory.\nGibbs said the flood into consumer staples has also sent the sector's price-to-earnings ratio to an all-time high; the forward P/E for consumer staples is now 21, versus 16 for the broader S&P 500.

The attack was blamed on Boko Haram.\nIn case you were wondering, the group formerly known as Boko Haram didn\u2019t go away.\nThe vicious band of militant Islamists wrecking West Africa is using women and girls to stage a comeback. To date, there have been 53 female suicide bombers in 2015. \u201cNo terrorist group in history has used as many female suicide bombers as [Boko Haram] has used this year,\u201d notes Scott Stewart, analyst for geopolitical forecasting firm Stratfor.\nAfter one historic presidential election in Nigeria, along with faint mainstream-media spotlight on #BringBackOurGirls, Boko Haram had receded into Western-world unfamiliarity. Newly minted President Muhammadu Buhari talked tough, publicly baking the Islamist insurgency group into his to-do list of national priorities. Voters, understandably eager to put the country\u2019s troubles to rest, showered him with a 70 percent approval rating, with 20 percent in July saying \u201csecurity has improved.\u201d Buhari obliged with a December deadline to finish off Boko Haram.\nBut with fresh allegiance to the Islamic State group in Syria and a slick, long-name rebrand (they want to be called \u201cWilayat al Sudan al Gharbi\u201d), Boko Haram has been hitting Nigeria hard with an \u201cunprecedented use\u201d of girls as suicide bombers, according to Stratfor analysis.\nThe numbers are both horrifying and sobering.\nSince July, there have been nearly 300 deaths caused by suspected Boko Haram suicide attacks, most in the vicinity of Maiduguri, upper-northeastern Nigeria\u2019s largest city. Additionally, more than 70 have been killed in the eastern state of Adamawa. Throughout Nigeria, 170 people have been killed in October alone, bringing the number of deaths to more than 1,400 since Buhari took office this year. Nigerian secret police even reported the recent arrest of 45 suspects planning large-scale bombings in Lagos, the center of the country\u2019s burgeoning economy.\nBut in a disturbing new development, the number of female suicide bombers has now surpassed that of male bombers, with 17 women or girls used to carry out attacks versus 14 men or boys during October throughout Nigeria and neighboring Niger, Chad and Cameroon. Girls identified range in age from 9 to 15. Steep increases in the number of women or girls deployed for suicide attacks were also seen in February, June and July, months that marked the presidential election and the beginning of Buhari\u2019s administration.\nLagos-based women\u2019s activist Moyo Hicks tells The Root that Boko Haram actually began using female suicide bombers last year, in an attack on Gombe, Nigeria, in June 2014. Since then, Hicks has observed an uptick in the number of female suicide bombers, most of them teenagers and also some children.\nSome of the most audacious attacks occurred in October, prompting reaction from Western observers while sending freshly symbolic messages to the terror-wracked nation. On Oct. 16, three women with bombs strapped to their chests killed 26 Muslim worshipers in a Maiduguri suburb. Back-to-back suicide bombings in neighboring Adamawa and Borno states left more than 60 dead.\n\u201cThe apparent use of children\u2014particularly young girls\u2014to commit these attacks is especially heinous, and it provides yet more examples of the horrific measures Boko Haram is willing to take,\u201d said U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby during a press briefing last week.\nAnd there\u2019s little sign that it will end anytime soon. Despite overly optimistic pre-election reports in which the previous president, Goodluck Jonathan, attempted to grandstand a grand deal for the release of the 276 kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls, most remained missing. Some may have already been used to carry out suicide bombings.\nSadly, there\u2019s a ghastly strategic method to Boko Haram\u2019s madness. Insurgents have no interest in letting kidnapped women go, with aims to continue the sinister franchise, certain that they can leverage them at points when the military closes in. But holding on to them has become an enormous logistical drag on the terror group, from having to feed kidnapped girls to the cost of moving victims around. So like any club of homicidal, fake-religious wing nuts, Boko Haram decides that it must loosen the weight, indiscriminately using kidnapped victims as suicide bombers instead.\nHicks, however, claims that there are quite a few female suicide bombers related to Boko Haram in other ways. Hicks cites the case of Zaharau Babangida, a 13-year-old caught in Kano by authorities last year. Zaharau\u2019s parents initiated her into Boko Haram and demanded that she attempt a suicide mission for a trip to \u201cparadise\u201d or else she\u2019d be killed.\nUltimately, female bombers serve the purpose of throwing government military forces off their game, since typically, women and girls are harder to spot as bomb-wearing insurgents than men and boys, especially young girls. With the Obama administration deploying several hundred troops to the region since last year (including 300 to Cameroon this month alone), Boko Haram has found itself boxed in along Nigeria\u2019s borders.\nMinority Report Nigeria\u2019s Ndi B. Kato, who resides in the country\u2019s capital of Abuja, argues that the recent trend is also reflective of a larger problem in Nigeria, particularly in its northern regions: unequal treatment of women.", "THERE REALLY IS no set time when I change my address book to a new one. It's not like a calendar or an air filter where you pretty much have built-in deadlines for replacement. The address book has its own rhythm.\nMy address book has sort of settled in over time. It has become part of the universal oneness of household stuff, like that potato peeler I've had since I first set up wifely housekeeping 2,000 years ago. Like the ragged rubber-tipped bowl scraper and the ridiculous tea cozy shaped like a crown that has been sitting on my counter for years. I've never actually used it to keep my tea cozy, but almost all the people who enter my kitchen try it on their heads.\nLike many of us, the address book is just there, getting fatter and older. Mine has letters and business cards stuffed in the back, with scribbled phone numbers of people I ought to add but just haven't. The pages are crammed with the mini-histories of where my friends and relatives have moved, changed phones, husbands, jobs.\nSome time ago my address book started to ripen; the pages started to bend and fall out. Some of the individual boxes were so scratched up with changes that the S section had mutated into the T section.\nSo I got one of those electronic Rolodexes so I could have a perfectly neat and clear address book with me at all times. It took me hours to type in all the important numbers and addresses. With just a push of a button I could access any number I wanted, even on the freeway! I was liberated from my corpulent, decaying address book.\nThen one day I was at a red light pushing the proper button to find an electronic number. And nothing came up but blank space. In a panic, I repeatedly pushed \"reset.\" I used the bang-and-swear method, but there was no response. In a flash of remorse, I knew that my real address book would never have betrayed me like that. I felt bad for deserting my chubby paper friend for the slick and fickle fast lane of modern technology.\nWITH MY DIVORCE, I got custody of the potato peeler, the bowl scraper and the tea cozy. And that old address book came with me, too. As I flipped through the worn pages, I marveled at my ex-life. My address book was my personal museum, a stroll through every bad decision I ever made, every real friend I ever had, every Chinese takeout place I'd ever ordered from.\nSince I had left my imperfect past behind, I realized that now was probably the right time to transfer just the good parts to a pristine new address book, with all the names and addresses written in the same ink.\nAnd so the slaughter began. I cut out the heretics, the naysayers, the disloyal, the ex-in-laws. I even changed Chinese takeout places when I remembered that the last one forgot the spareribs I had ordered.\nSome dopey fondness for the grubby book kept me from tossing it into the nearest trash can, though. Instead I reluctantly exiled it to a high cupboard, the netherworld of Can't Keep It, Can't Throw It Out, where it sat beside my mini-tape measure, nine loose batteries and a doorknob I may or may not use one day.\nWHEN I WROTE my yearly newsletter over the holidays I was thrilled that I would save tons of money on stamps by not having to send it out to a bunch of ex-people.\nBut as I addressed the envelopes, a weird longing for that old address book came over me. I sneaked upstairs, climbed a chair, rummaged around and found the old girl. I dusted her off and open the tattered pages. And there, as if seen for the first time, like a crystal ball in reverse, were the excommunicated names from my past, with all their pain and promise.\nI took a deep breath and wrote some abandoned addresses on new envelopes to be sent a newsletter. And then, in the same ink I used for the others, I even put some of the old ones into my new book.", "Kanye West wants to do a duet with Dua Lipa for his highly-anticipated album 'Yandhi'.\nThe 'Famous' rapper is reportedly planning to get the 'Electricity' hitmaker on his already star-studded next record, which is the follow-up to 2018's 'Ye'.\nThe pair met at one of the 41-year-old star's legendary Sunday church services in Los Angeles, and Kanye is believed to have already penned \"a few songs\" that are \"perfect\" for the 23-year-old pop superstar.\nAn insider told The Sun newspaper's Bizarre column: \"Kanye is super impressed with Dua's voice and he knows she's really hot property in the industry right now.\n\"He met her at the church service he holds in LA every Sunday and is now keen to get her on board.\n\"She's already teamed up with Calvin Harris and he saw how well that song did commercially.\n\"He's got a few songs he thinks Dua would be perfect for and is really eager to get her on his next album Yandhi.\"\nThe 'New Rules' singer has long been a fan of Kanye's music, and even got caught up in his controversial feud with Taylor Swift, after she chose the 'Stronger' hitmaker as her favourite artist over the 'End Game' singer in a lighthearted quiz from 2016, which was unearthed last year.\n\"[The fans] were sending me snake emojis for, like, three days straight.

Mr Mistry's removal from the position of director came because he admittedly sent out company information to the I-T (department), press, and came out in public against the board and the trust.\"\nThe National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Monday dismissed pleas of Cyrus Mistry challenging his removal as Tata Sons chairman as also the allegations of rampant misconduct on part of Ratan Tata and the company's Board.\nA special bench of the tribunal held that the Board of Directors at Tata Sons was \"competent\" to remove the executive chairperson of the company.\nNCLT bench members B S V Prakash Kumar and V Nallasenapathy said that Mistry was ousted as chairman because the Tata Sons' Board and its majority shareholders had \"lost confidence in him\".\nReading out the judgement's operative part, the bench said that \"he (Mistry) admittedly sent out crucial information related to the Tata firms to the Income Tax department, leaked information to the press, and after he came out in public against the company and its board members\".\nThe Tata Group had argued that the law clearly allows removal of a chairperson and director and Mistry was removed by a majority of seven out of nine, as Mistry had not voted for his removal and another official had abstained.\nThe bench in its order today agreed with arguments of the Tata group.\n\"We have found no merit in the argument that Ratan Tata, Soonawala interfered, or that their conduct caused prejudice to the company's interest. In view of all of the above, we hold that Mr Mistry's removal doesn't call for action under 241 of the (Companies) Act,\" it said.\nAccording to section 241 of the Companies Act, any member of a company can make an application to the NCLT for seeking in case the company's affairs are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest, or in a manner oppressive to any member of such company.\nThe tribunal rejected Mistry's allegations against Tata Sons Board and Ratan Tata of mismanagement of affairs and oppression of minority shareholders.\nIt also rejected all allegations of lapses in governance on part of the group when it came to Air Asia, Nano and Aircel, and of a breakdown of corporate governance.\nThe bench said it had found no merit in Mistry's allegations and concluded that the Board was acting in accordance with the Companies Act of 2013.\nAfter the tribunal delivered its judgement, Mistry's office issued a statement describing the ruling as \"disappointing although not surprising\".\nIt said Mistry would \"continue to strive for ensuring good governance and protection of interests of minority shareholders and all stakeholders in Tata Sons from the wilful brute rule of the majority.\n\"The ruling is in line with the earlier position expressed by the tribunal. An appeal on merits will be pursued\".\nNot only the facts that were under consideration but also subsequent facts and developments that continue to evidence oppression and mismanagement will be under scrutiny and will be pursued in full earnest, the statement said.\n\"Ours has always been a principled fight to restore the Tata Group to its glorious days of high standards, best practices and most importantly, the best value systems.\n\"In this journey, no matter how hard it may seem, as shareholders, who have always supported the Tata Group, it remains our duty to protect the Tata Group from those who are destroying value and making the Group vulnerable to eternal forces,\" the statement said.\nWelcoming the order, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran hoped that \"a finality will be given to the judgement of NCLT, by all concerned in the larger interest of companies, the shareholders and the public\".\n\"The judgement has only re-affirmed and vindicated that Tata Sons and its operating companies have always acted in a fair manner and in the best interest of its stakeholders,\" he said in a statement.\nThe Tata Group has always been committed and will continue to be committed to transparency and good corporate governance of global standards, he added.\nUnder the Companies Act 2013, an order of NCLT can be challenged before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).\nMistry, who was the sixth chairman of Tata Sons, was ousted from the position in October 2016.\nHe had taken over as the chairman in 2012 after Ratan Tata announced his retirement.\nTwo months later, Mistry's family-run firms Cyrus Investments Pvt Ltd and Sterling Investments Corp approached the NCLT as minority shareholders, against Tata Sons, Ratan Tata, and some other board members.\nMistry in his pleas primarily argued that his removal was not in accordance with the Companies Act and that there was rampant mismanagement of affairs across Tata Sons.\nHe also alleged that Tata Trust chairperson Ratan Tata and trustee N Soonawala interfered with the day-to-day operations of the group companies, they acted as shadow directors, and all of the above caused massive revenue loss for the group.\nThe Tata Group had denied all charges and said Mistry was removed because the Board had lost confidence in him.\nWhy was Cyrus Mistry shown the door?", "New forms of misconduct have emerged (and traditional ones have changed their meaning) under pressure from the increasing global scale and multicultural nature of collaborations, their increasing interdisciplinary makeup, and the growing reliance on digital technologies for publishing and accessing scholarship. Plagiarism has become frequently associated with non-native English speaking students and scientists (Xiguang & Lei 1996; Brumfiel 2007) who claim to be forced to copy from well-written papers or articles to meet the demands of instructors or peer reviewers that, they say, evaluate language fluency, not just content (Vasconcelos 2009; Yalmaz 2007). And while textual similarity algorithms make plagiarism of published texts much easier to detect, they have little purchase on the new and growing appropriation of unpublished texts like grant proposals and manuscripts submitted for publication (Price 2006; Rennie 1993; Biagioli 2012 (a)(b)). Plagiarism has also spawn \u201cself- plagiarism\u201d or duplicate publication, which, like the plagiarism of grant proposals, was of little concern a couple of decades ago (Errami et al. 2008, 2009; Garner 2009; Samuelson 1994). And if falsification and fabrication used to involve only scholarly claims, it has now migrated to resumes, grade transcripts, and referee reports (Retraction Watch 2012). New questionable forms of publication also include the peddling of new journals with dubious publishers and editors (and even conferences with fake organizing committees) that appear to provide credible venues for scholarly communication but are in fact borderline scam operations preying on scholars\u2019 fears about the length of their vitae. Also new and increasingly common is so-called \u201cghostwriting\u201d: the production of biomedical articles by professional writers hired by pharmaceutical companies that are eventually published under the name of academic scientists who lend \u201cbrand recognition\u201d to these articles without having had much (or any) role in them (Sismondo 2009; Fugh-Berman 2010). These developments both highlight and modify the traditional tensions between academia and private-sector interests, while further complicating still unresolved questions over the meaning of authorship and the role of the names listed in a publication\u2019s byline \u2013 questions that have become increasingly more complex as the scale of some collaborations has reached into four-digit territory (Biagioli 1998, 2000, 2006; Biagioli & Galison 2003).\nMisconduct is an experiment we do not want to see replicated, and yet one that teaches us a lot about the tensions within the system of scholarly communication. And new forms of misconduct (precisely because they are new) may tell us how the system is changing, and where the new stress points are. New misuses of the author function (such as ghostwriting) are bringing up new interesting problem about the meaning of authors\u2019 names, and the expectation of accountability we have developed around them, as well as the issue of corporate authorship that they try to render invisible. Similarly, new patterns of plagiarism triggered (allegedly) by the linguistic requirements of top-tier journals are a window not on cultural specificities and perceptions of the divide between what is allowable borrowing and what instead counts as appropriation, but rather on the tensions between the global north and global south around the use of English as the standard language of an increasingly global science. Similarly, plagiarism generated in peer review contexts reminds us of the inherently difficult and ambiguous role of the reviewer \u2014 a person we ask to spend time evaluating and making scholarship better without being allegedly allowed to learn and use anything from that which s/he helps make better, and without being paid or receiving public credit for that (Biagioli 2007). Without in any way condoning the profoundly unethical and possibly illegal actions of some reviewers, can we really take the role of the peer reviewer, as we construe it now, to be unproblematic? Or have we created an imaginary figure simply because we had to, because the logic of the system required the assumption of the existence of such a person or figure \u2014 like the \u201creasonable person\u201d or the \u201cperson skilled in the art\u201d we find in law? How can we make that role more realistic and viable?\nYear 1: Emergent Misconduct.

We will also have a one-day research workshop (funded by the Center for Science and Innovation Studies (CSIS)) entitled \u201cPublication Mismatches\u201d on the work academics produce and .\nYear 2: Learning from Misconduct: Appropriation and Authorship in the Age of Digital Publications. A large international conference on this topic will be the public highlight of this year\u2019s activities, while the team\u2019s main research focus will be on peer review, its functions and forms (blind, double-blind, open) and locations in the system of scholarly communication, the role of definitions of reviewers and editors, the use of peer review results in scholarly evaluations, but also its drawbacks (its documented conservative bias, etc) and review-related forms of misconduct that have surfaced. We aim for a review paper of the growing literature and empirical evidence on this topic, and at identifying the specific topics and collaborators for the third year\u2019s program.\nYear 3: Can There Be Life After Peer Review? Run a workshop on the possibility of a system of academic publication that does not fundamentally rest on peer review, and on whether (and why) the answers may be different depending on the disciplines. In the same year, CSIS will organize and fund a related workshop on \u201cFrom Record to Work: The History and Sociology of the Curriculum Vitae\u201d focusing on how, in the age of publish-or-perish, what used to be a record of a scholar\u2019s work has effectively become a work in and of itself, and what that captures about changes in scholarly publication and credit metrics.", "President Kufuor is expected to make a historic trip to Dagbon in the Northern Region next week to meet with the chiefs and interact with the elders of the traditional area.\nBut as already explained to party supporters, he will not mount a political platform to seek his re-election as has been the case with those parts of the country he has been visiting. He goes to mourn with the bereaved family and people of Dagbon over the loss of his friend, the Overlord Yakubu Andani II.\nThese disclosures were made by sitting MP for the Yendi Constituency and former Minister for the Interior Alhaji Malik Al-Hassan Yakubu last Monday in an interview with the Network Herald during the launch of \u201cPositive Change Chapter Two\u201d in Accra.\nAccording to him that eagerly awaited visit two clear years after the royal clash between the Abudus and the Andanis that resulted in the murder of the Ya-Na and forty of his subjects is being honoured upon careful reflection backed by sound advice.\nAlhaji Malik acknowledged though that while the presidency would adhere primarily to using the visit to demonstrate sensitivity to the norms and values of the people by not mounting a political platform to campaign in Dagbon, the visit has the potential of reinforcing the chances of the ruling NPP and enhance its margins at the December 7th polls in Dagbon. But he was quick to add that Dagbon had traditionally been a stronghold of the United Party (UP) from which his party draws inspiration.\nHe submitted that though the NPP is expected to win in the area even without the visit of the President, the visit could also have a timely effect on the people so far as the commitment of the president to absolute peace in the area is concerned. It is also expected that the interaction with the traditional authorities and opinion leaders would help the people go into the December polls with a better purpose than acrimony.\nThe former Interior Minister seeking re-election revealed further that after this visit which will concretize plans for the burial and funeral arrangement of the Ya-Na, the President would then join the people in celebrating the funeral to further emphasis the place of unity in his administration.\nAlhaji Malik who is also a Member of the Pan African Parliament told the paper that President Kufuor is very sensitive to Dagbon people and thinks the right atmosphere has now been created for him to meet the people.\nHe is hopeful that the people of Dagbon would reciprocate the gesture by recounting all that the president had done in the wake of the tragedy particularly the appointment of the Committee of Eminent Chiefs, Nayiri and the Asantehene among others to help solve the aged old dispute.\nHe disagreed with suggestions that the government woefully failed to put adequate measures in place to prevent the 2002 carnage but agreed with concerns that the Dagbon problem could persist for a long time until the root cause of the protracted chieftaincy problem is addressed.\nAlhaji Malik said prior to \u201cthe Yendi massacre\u201d government was examining the complex dimensions of the Dagbon chieftaincy saga that had divided the people since independence so as to find a lasting solution only for its opponents to, for their own selfish reasons, throw a spanner into spokes to derail the process.\nAlhaji Malik expressed great uneasiness that the body of the Ya-Na should still be in the morgue two years after his death because it is contrary to both his Islamic faith and the tradition of the people of Dagbon.\nHowever, he said that contrary to media reports about that Dagbon is 'hot', the place is presently so peaceful that he personally feels at home there than in Accra. He claimed that the people had resolved to live together and are going about their chores peacefully.", "Rediff.com \u00bb Movies \u00bb PIX: Family time for Bipasha and Karan!\nPIX: Family time for Bipasha and Karan!\nWhile Varun Dhawan and Sidarth Malhotra show off their muscles, Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover decide it's time for family.

While that news is incredibly exciting for fans of last year's Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, it's a lot of pressure for director Jake Kasdan as well as co-writers Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg, who are still crafting the story as of this writing. The first installment filmed in the fall of 2016 for a December of 2017 release date, which means that Jumanji 3 is going to have to start filming really soon.\nIn a new interview with Collider, Jumanji 3 director Jake Kasdan revealed that he hopes to start production in the beginning of 2019, which gives the cast and crew at just under a year to complete the film. Kasdan said, \"the idea is to make the movie at the beginning of the year... if we can get it all worked out.\" It was imagined that the third installment would follow the pattern of the sequel with filming set for this fall. However, Kasdan says that will not be the case. It's evident that the director is highly aware of the pressure to get the story right and be able to film everything in a short amount of time.\nJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was a pleasant surprise for old fans and newcomers to the franchise, but the last movie will make it difficult to follow up for a few reasons. Number one, last year's sequel was a smash at the box office, nearly making $1 billion worldwide. That's already pressure to have to compete with themselves. Additionally, the story was made up of individuals that had to get used to their new avatars, which was part of the original charm. Now, the characters know each other and the their alter egos. The story of Jumanji 3 is going to have to undergo some major tinkering to get to a story that's as imaginative and original as the last film.\nWhile Jake Kasdan would not offer up any information about what Jumaji 3 will be about, partly because they're currently writing it, he did seem confident that he and Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg had come up with something special that they are all excited about. The director also indicated that he is preparing to spend the next year-and-a-half on Jumanji 3, while also highlighting that there is still a lot of work to be done over the next few months to get the story fleshed out.\nAs for whether or not Jumanji 3 will return to Honolulu, Hawaii to film, Jake Kasdan was unsure if they will be returning at this time. The Hawaiian jungles served as an important backdrop for the last movie, so it was thought that they would be making a return. While Kasdan admits that they would all love to return to Honolulu, he also states that, \"we have not sorted out the locations yet.\" Basically, there's a lot of work that needs to be completed on Jumanji 3 before any wheels start moving. You can watch the interview with Jake Kasdan below, thanks to the Collider YouTube channel. The production start and location talk appears at the 3-minute mark.", "San Luis Obispo County Supervisor Adam Hill cast the deciding vote last week to approve a contract of more than $360,000 for the organization that employs his fianc\u00e9e.\nHill often abstains or recuses himself when the Board of Supervisors votes on contracts for the Community Action Partnership of San Luis Obispo, which employs his fianc\u00e9e Dee Torres as its homeless services director. But, at the September 10 board meeting, he voted for a $361,347 mental health services contract for CAPSLO, that otherwise would not have passed.\nHill\u2019s vote capped a recent pattern of the supervisor choosing not to distance himself from the approval process of CAPSLO contracts.\nThe Board of Supervisors currently has only four members due to the June death of Supervisor Paul Teixeira. At last week\u2019s meeting, Supervisor Debbie Arnold recused herself from the vote on the CAPSLO contract, bringing the remaining number of eligible voters to three.\nArnold sits on the board of directors for CAPSLO, as well as on the Homeless Services Oversight Council, which approves funding for the nonprofit. County Counsel Rita Neal suggested that Arnold recuse herself from voting on CAPSLO contracts last week as she investigated whether or not the supervisor had a conflict of interest in approving funding for an organization that she represents.\nHad Hill also recused himself on the September 10 CAPSLO vote, there would not have been a board majority needed to conduct a vote on the measure, and the approval of the contract would have stalled.\nPrior to voting on the contract, Hill asked Neal whether supervisors possess conflicts of interest when they vote on contracts for other boards on which they sit. Hill did not, however, mention that he often does not vote on CAPSLO contracts due to his perceived conflict of interest.\nThe Board of Supervisors approves several million dollars annually in funding for CAPSLO, much of which goes to homeless services in the form of federal grants.\nNeal responded to Hill prior to last week\u2019s vote by saying she was still investigating the matter. Arnold told CalCoastNews Monday that Neal concluded her investigation and determined that Arnold does not have a conflict of interest in approving funding for CAPSLO because she reaps no personal financial benefit from the matter.\nNeither Neal, nor Hill responded to CalCoastNews email requests for an explanation of why Hill recuses himself on some CAPSLO votes but not on others.\nAn examination of Hill\u2019s voting pattern over the last two years on matters pertaining to CAPSLO contracts shows the supervisor has become increasingly lax in his efforts to avoid creating a conflict of interest.\nPrior to a March 20, 2012 Board of Supervisors hearing on the distribution of annual U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grant money, Hill announced that he would recuse himself.\n\u201cMr. Chairman, with an abundance of precaution, I\u2019m going to recuse myself on this item,\u201d Hill said.\nHe then left the dais and did not return to the meeting until the completion of the item.\nTwo weeks later, the board approved a $301,995 contract, funded by state prison realignment money, for CAPSLO case management services. Hill again recused himself, but he neither provided a reason nor left the dais.\nOn December 11, 2012, the board held a hearing to discuss preliminary distribution of 2013 HUD grant funding. No vote occurred, but the board heard funding requests from several CAPSLO employees and then discussed a proposal for distributing nonprofit grant money that involved concentrating more of the funds with CAPSLO.\nHill neither recused himself, nor stated that he had a conflict of interest. Instead, he recommended that, in 2013, the board distribute the grant money to fewer nonprofit recipients.\nOn January 29, Hill returned to recusing himself when two CAPSLO related items appeared on the consent agenda. One item increased the prison realignment case management contract by $58,034. The other was a vote to approve appointments to the Homeless Services Oversight Council. Torres was one of the individuals recommended for appointment. Hill recused himself from both votes.\nIn March, the board voted on the distribution of the 2013 HUD money. Hill again remained at the dais and participated in the discussion. He argued that money allocated for an Oceano drainage project should instead go to homeless services in the county. The board then voted to reallocate some of the money, but Hill abstained from the vote.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to abstain from the final vote, so there is no appearance of conflict in regards to CAPSLO\u2019s funding,\u201d Hill said.\nHill did not recuse himself, though. Meeting minutes likewise stated that he abstained, as opposed to recusing himself. Commonly, a recusal indicates a board member\u2019s acknowledgement of a conflict of interest on an item, whereas an abstention does not.\nSince his March 5 abstention, Hill has voted to give CAPSLO contracts for childcare, family services, parental education and teen parenting case management, in addition to the mental health services contract issued last week. The childcare contract, which Hill voted in favor of on June 18 totaled more than $1.5 million. On July 9, he voted for a family services and parental education contract totaling more than $407,098.\nI hear a \u2018SAVE Adam Hill\u201d committee has already geared up?\nThis is nothing more than local political earmarking\u2026.or \u201cDee\u201dmarking in this case.\nBecause CAPSLO administers public funds and has financial and legal responsibilities to the public, issues regarding conflicts of interest are extremely sensitive. Such conflicts can result from seemingly innocent situations in your personal and professional affairs. You have an obligation to conduct business using good judgment, adhering to high ethical standards, and avoiding situations, which create an actual or potential conflict between your personal interests and the interests of CAPSLO. A conflict of interest exists when your loyalties are divided between CAPSLO\u2019s interests and those of another, such as yourself, a supplier, a client or a co-worker. Both the fact and the appearance of a conflict of interest should be avoided.\n\uf0a8 Soliciting or accepting any gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to any sub-agreements with CAPSLO. It will normally be acceptable to accept extremely modest entertainment (such as a lunch invitation) or personal gifts of nominal value (not to exceed $25) from any person that is or may possibly be doing business with CAPSLO; however, it is never acceptable for an employee, officer, manager or agent of CAPSLO to solicit or accept any amount of cash from current or potential clients, suppliers, contractors, or vendors. Employees, officers or agents of CAPSLO may not accept anything as a result of, or in anticipation of any transaction with a present or prospective consumer, contractor, vendor, partner or donor. It is important that employees decline any gratuities which could cause even the slightest question of improper influence. Gifts based entirely upon kinship, marriage or social relationships entirely beyond and apart from any business context are not subject to these prohibitions. These ethical standards flow both ways. Accordingly, it would be a violation of these standards for any CAPSLO employee, officer or agent to offer an inappropriate gratuity to any consumer, vendor or contractor.\n\uf0a8 Using or disclosing confidential CAPSLO information for personal gain or to CAPSLO\u2019s detriment.\n\uf0a8 Having a direct or indirect financial interest in, or relationship with, a supplier or other agency, which might adversely affect otherwise objective, decisions by CAPSLO in which you are involved. Such an interest would include situations where there is an actual or potential financial interest in a firm selected to do business with CAPSLO and that firm either employs or is about to employ you or a member of your family.\n\uf0a8 Using CAPSLO assets or labor for personal use.\n\uf0a8 Engaging CAPSLO in a business relationship with a relative or personal friend where you benefit by the relationship.\n\uf0a8 Personal lending, borrowing or investment transactions with fellow employees or clients.\nThese guidlines would mean something if they included one sentence about disiplinary consequences.\nUnfortunately, since the BOS and CAPSLO both use most ethical codes as toilet-paper, I wouldn\u2019t expect them to change their ways any time soon\u2026.not as long as Adam Hill is calling the shots for the BOS.\nAnd the saga continues\u2026\u2026new day same players, same story! Am I the only one who doesn\u2019t get why Hill and Torres flip the finger at ethics, doing whats right, and morals, yet everyone in a position to stop things, stand there waving a green flag! UNBELIEVABLE!!! The moral of this story; do what you want, take what you want, stomp on who you want, make your own rules or change them to fit you, and have no regrets! The Dangerous Duo strikes again!\nYou are not the only one that sees the issues. The interesting thing is that when you link the Capslo issues, the county issues, the solid waste / hazardous waste issues you see the same players. The little people, like us are just too busy trying to survive and if you speak up they do come after you.\nSaid it before, and I\u2019ll say it again, the man is a waste of skin.\nThis man has been required by law to take every two years, a two hour professionally administered multi-media CLEAR focused course on ethics in government, known as AB1234 training. I\u2019ve taken it many times, and it definitely covers NOT voting where you OR A FAMILY MEMBER OR PROSPECTIVE FAMILY MEMBER OR FINANCIALLY INVOLVED INDIVIDUAL will come within a MILE of financial gain remotely connected to your vote. Voting for big contracts for the agency of his squeeze is so BLATANT.\nThis point has been well made by others posting here, I am merely repeating this conclusion.\nSupervisor Adam Hill should be filed against by the State Fair Political Practices Commission or other prosecuting agency for misdemeanor violation of state law.

If the public can question the validity of the information they get, be it from new or traditional media, this will benefit the country's development, he said.\n\"Singapore and China's bilateral ties are a very unique one because they are not just at the economic and security level, they encompass a lot of other dimensions like social governance, leadership, development, including the sharing of our judiciary systems' development,\" he said.\n\"One of the conclusions from the discussion was that in order for us to have such frank and open discussion, there must be deep trust among the people between (government and media) institutions and this is what we hope to see continuously across generations.\"\nAssociate Professor Zhang Weiyu from the National University of Singapore's Department of Communications and New Media, a forum participant, said: \"The session talked about digital media and the recent media revolutions going on in China - we can see that China has gone very far in terms of new practices.\n\"There were many insights regarding the challenges facing traditional media and how it is able to transform itself into media formats that suit the needs of the young people.\"", "AKURE \u2013 THE Senate Committee on Works has commended the infrastructural drive which Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has brought to bear on the Sunshine State since the inception of his administration.\nSpeaking while on a courtesy visit to the State Governor in his office in Akure, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kabiru Gaya, said one could see across the state, several development projects the governor has been delivering for the well-being of citizens of the state.\nThe Senate Committee members were in Ondo State to inspect the condition of federal roads in Ondo State so as to integrate the reconstruction or repairs of such roads into the 2019 federal Budget.\nSenator Gaya expressed satisfaction at the several ongoing road projects in the state and commended the state government for rehabilitating some of the federal roads despite the current economic downturn affecting revenues inflow into the state coffers.\nWhile expressing concerns at the discomfort road users pass through on some of the federal roads in the state and some parts of the 31 states the committee had visited, Senator Gana assured that the Federal Government would in no distance begin work on some of the roads, particularly the Akure-Ado Ekiti Road.\nResponding, Governor Akeredolu lauded the commitment of the Federal Government, under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, for delivering monumental projects across the country.\nThe governor stated that the APC controlled Federal Government has performed creditably to accelerate national development hence the need to key into its agenda to transform Nigeria.\nGovernor Akeredolu used the opportunity to highlight some of the interventions of the State Government on some federal roads so as to make the roads in their deplorable conditions become passable by motorists.\nSome of the federal roads the State Government was working on, according to Akeredolu include the 10 terribly bad portions on Owo-Ikare Road, the Akure-Owo Road, and IgbaraOke-Ekiti Road.\nWhile calling on the Federal Government to reimburse the state with funds expended on federal roads in the state, the Governor said his administration would not for any reason allow citizens of the state to be subjected to hardships, on either state or federal roads, within the state.\nHe pleaded for urgent actions on the federal roads in the state particularly the Ikare-Owo, Ipele-Isua and Ondo-Ore roads with a promise to undertake a Flyover Bridge on the Lagos- Ore-Benin expressway at Ore to ease free flow of traffic.", "Nestl\u00e9 USA said it is removing artificial ingredients from its Crunch, Butterfinger, Oh Henry!, Raisinets and other chocolate treats in response to consumer interest in healthier foods.

The new versions will begin appearing on shelves in mid-2015. \u201cWe know that candy consumers are interested in broader food trends around fewer artificial ingredients,\u201d Doreen Ida, president of Nestl\u00e9 USA Confections & Snacks, said in a statement.

They have had a fantastic start.\"\nUnited, and in particular Rooney, cannot say the same.\nDimitar Berbatov has been the Red Devils' stand-out offensive player so far this season and Michael Owen has scored three times in a week, so there was an argument that Rooney did not deserve to be selected this week anyway.\nHis ankle niggle has provided a reason for Ferguson to leave him at home, which will allow the 24-year-old a chance to get his mind right following damaging allegations about his private life.\nUnited are yet to offer any firm indication of how long Rooney will be absent for, with his next two opportunities to return coming against Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday and for England in their Euro 2012 qualifier with Montenegro on October 12.\nHowever, at least by confirming his absence at this early stage, matchday should be relatively free of diversions.\n\"We have picked up experience of playing in Europe and we have confidence,\" said Fletcher. \"We know how to cope with the travel and the different styles of play.

Online games account for the next largest block at 10 percent, up from 9 percent in the previous survey.\nThat\u2019s great if you are Facebook or social-gaming giant Zynga, but if your business involves email or you happen to be a \u201cportal\u201d such as Yahoo or MSN, the Nielsen numbers don\u2019t have a lot of good news for you: the survey shows that the amount of time Americans spend on email has dropped by almost a third, to 8 percent from over 11 percent last year, and time spent at portal sites fell by almost 20 percent compared to the previous year.\nNielsen broke down the stats into a graphic that shows what your time online would look like if all of the activity surveyed were squeezed into a single hour \u2014 social networks and blogs would account for almost 14 minutes of that hour, games would use up to 6 minutes and email 5 minutes. Portals, meanwhile, would account for just 2 minutes of the hour, almost exactly the same amount of time that users spend instant messaging.\nInterestingly enough, the situation is reversed on mobiles. Email still takes up the majority of time spent, and would account for almost half of the hour, according to Nielsen\u2019s survey. Social networks and blogs account for just 6 minutes of time spent on mobiles, and portals about 7 percent.\nThese results paired with the recent ACSI release show just how huge of an opportunity there is to give existing social media platforms a run for their money.\nOne comment I\u2019d make on this type of data is how it fails to recognize large clumps of outliers (i.e., enthusiasts). That is, of the folks who game, a nontrivial segment game a TON. Similarly, of the folks that waste time on social media stuff, a big chunk spend a lot of time there. These are the sort of populations that sway elections (via micro-targeting), make certain television stations viable, and so on. They are an essential and critical segment of the landscape.\nFinally, I take exception at Nielsen\u2019s depiction of \u201cportal\u201d as a distinct sector, which I\u2019d argue isn\u2019t accurate anymore and hasn\u2019t been for quite some time.\nGreat post. Strange to see that online games overtook email. Great stats also. Thanks for sharing.\nIn the last paragraph, I think you mean 7 minutes, not 7 percent.\nThat\u2019s true, Erin \u2014 another good point.

Everyone has a story to tell about their technology or data or approach. But the only hard numbers, required by regulation, come from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which asks that any company driving autonomously report how many miles they\u2019ve driven and how many times a human had to take over for the car\u2019s AI.\nEach year, Waymo, the self-driving car unit inside Alphabet, has been way out in front. The same was true again. In California, they drove 352,545 autonomous miles with 63 total disengagements, for a yearly average of 5,595 miles per disengagement. In the company\u2019s best month, November 2017, they did 30,516 miles with a single disengagement. The only surprise in Waymo\u2019s numbers is that their disengagement rate did not decline much from last year\u2019s numbers. They also reported that they\u2019ve been testing far more extensively, racking up 2 million total miles last year in 20 different cities.\nAll this to say: Waymo\u2019s been at it the longest and is certainly furthest along in developing a real autonomous service.\nThe only company that\u2019s even in the same order of magnitude, in terms of miles driven in California, is Cruise, which was acquired by GM. They did 125,000 miles on San Francisco\u2019s streets in self-driving mode and reported 105 total disengagements, for a yearly average of 1,254 miles per disengagement. In Cruise\u2019s best month, October 2017, they drove 27,576 miles with only 3 disengagements.\nThese numbers show that Cruise has become become the clear-cut No. 2 for companies that are doing live testing in California. No one else is even close.\nWhat about Tesla, you ask? Well, their filing to the regulatory body notes, almost as an aside, that they drove 0 autonomous miles in the state of California. Their letter to the DMV primarily makes the argument for the value of their singular approach.\nThis may all be true, but we would just have to take Tesla\u2019s word for it, while these other companies are showing what they can do in live conditions, and subject to regulatory oversight. For now, there is not enough evidence in the actual record to judge where Tesla\u2019s efforts should rank.\nMany of the big car companies who were licensed to test autonomous vehicles did not actually do so, or barely dipped a toe in the water. BMW, Ford, Honda, and Volkswagen did not test their cars in autonomous mode in California for a single mile on public roads. Mercedes-Benz logged 1,087 miles. Other than GM, only Nissan logged more than 5,000 miles among the big car companies, and they did 5,007, although with a top-three disengagement rate.\nTwo well-funded start-ups put up interesting performances. Zoox, which has taken $290 million in venture funding, was able to go 430 miles per disengagement in the final month of the reporting period, November 2017, though they only had 2,244 miles for the whole year. Drive.ai, which has taken $77 million in VC, did 6,572 total autonomous miles with 151 disengagements, for a respectable average of 43 for the year. November 2017 was their best month, too, when they managed 2,642 autonomous miles with only 24 disengagements for an average of 110 miles per problem.\nOverall, the new numbers feel a little disappointing. We\u2019re not seeing a spike in the number of companies that are able to execute well on California roads, nor are we seeing an explosion in the number of miles driven or massive reductions in disengagements per mile. It could be that this is happening in other states, outside the regulatory reporting spotlight. But for now, this looks like a two-car race with a Tesla revving its engine in the infield.", "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s top finance bureaucrat resigned on Wednesday after a weekly magazine said he had sexually harassed several female reporters, the latest blow for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe whose ratings have been hit by a series of scandals.\nFinance Minister Taro Aso told reporters that he had accepted Administrative Vice Finance Minister Junichi Fukuda\u2019s resignation.\nIt is the latest in a number of headaches for Aso and Abe. A steady trickle of allegations about suspected cronyism and cover-ups has raised doubts about how long Abe can stay in power.\nFukuda denies the allegations against him but told reporters he resigned because he could not further disrupt work at the ministry. He said he still intended to sue the magazine, Shincho.\n\u201cI am to blame for causing the media report about myself while the finance ministry faces a severe situation,\u201d he said.\nHe added that he did not recall having the \u201cterrible conversation\u201d reported in the magazine.\nThe Finance Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that it would continue to investigate the allegations surrounding Fukuda through an external law firm, given that the initial internal fact-finding had been conducted by Fukuda\u2019s subordinate.\nIt called on female reporters to come forward and contact the law firm if they were willing to cooperate with the investigation, drawing fire from several cabinet ministers including Seiko Noda, one of only two women in the cabinet.\nFukuda\u2019s resignation came just after the governor of Niigata prefecture, home to the world\u2019s largest nuclear power plant, resigned over an impending magazine article about his relations with women.\nRyuichi Yoneyama, who is single, said some of the money and presents he gave women he dated could be open to misinterpretation and that he was resigning to avoid further political \u201cturmoil\u201d.\nWhile Abe has made his \u201cWomenomics\u201d programmes to mobilise women in the workforce part of his policies to boost growth, big gender gaps persist at companies and in politics.\nAbe is currently in the United States for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, and Aso is set to leave on Thursday for an international meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington D.C.", "It would be an irony if the troubles the United States has visited on much of the earth were now visited upon the United States -- and, lest you\u2019re feeling smug about that possibility, it's not likely to be a happy irony if you happen to be a citizen of that country's next-door neighbour.\nStill, filmmaker Michael Moore probably has it right when he predicts Donald Trump will not serve out his full term as president.\nMoore, well known as a maker of documentaries with a distinctly progressive point of view, argues that the U.S. President Elect is simply too self-centred not to break the law in his own interests, political or otherwise.\nWe are advised to pay attention to Moore's prognostications because, after all, he famously predicted Trump's election while all the other pundits were still chortling at the Republican candidate\u2019s preposterous antics.\nBut if Trump, dangerously unpredictable buffoon though he may be, gets into trouble sufficient to see him impeached by the U.S. Congress or removed from office in some other way, it won't simply be because he breaks a law. That would merely provide an excuse. It will be because he goes ahead and enacts policies that offend what it\u2019s nowadays fashionable to call \"the Deep State,\" that is, the governing apparatus of the ruling class.\nTrump's open racism and his narcissism may offend many, but are less likely to be deal breakers for the people with real power.\nOn a range of issues, however, Trump's campaign policy positions were anathema to the American (and by extension, the world) ruling class, also known nowadays as \"the 1 per cent\u201d -- the one powerful trope bequeathed to us by the otherwise evanescent Occupy Movement.\nThese include, for example, his promises to tear up trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans Pacific Partnership that are really corporate-rights treaties generally harmful to ordinary citizens in signatory countries.\nAnother example was his position on North Atlantic Treaty Organization's mostly aspirational military budget guidelines for member states. A NATO tax of 2 per cent of GDP makes a convenient and generous subsidy for the U.S.-dominated military-industrial complex, but shouldn\u2019t distract us from the real purpose of the alliance in the post-Soviet era, to enforce American economic dominance on the world.\nWhen Trump tells NATO members to pay up or get out, that is exactly what the U.S. Deep State does not want to happen.\nClosely related to Trump's skepticism about NATO is his apparent lack of enthusiasm for the New Cold War against Russia -- one of two nuclear-armed states that are resistant to U.S. economic dominance. The other is China. A key part of the renewed Cold War has been the constant demonization by Western media of Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, now emerging as the other half of the first bromance of the Trump Era.\nSo on these issues and others, Trump\u2019s survival in office likely depends on his willingness to knuckle under to the demands of the Deep State -- not so different, in that regard, from the long list of leaders of other countries who hesitated to obey their marching orders from Washington.\nAs far as we know, there hasn\u2019t been an actual plot to overthrow the president of the United States through coup d\u2019\u00e9tat since 1933, although there are those in the tinfoil hat brigade who darkly see such plots behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 and the forced resignation of Richard M. Nixon in 1974.\nBe that as it may, just because Trump becomes president of the United States doesn't mean he'll be immune to such threats. His supporters see him as a revolutionary battering ram against \"the elites,\" real and imagined, and all through history the economic elite has struck back if its interests are truly threatened.\nThere's even a case to be made that Rome's conservatives murdered Julius Caesar because he was a reformer with a disturbing tendency toward democracy, not because he was an odious tyrant who dared to cross the Rubicon with his army.\nIn places where for one reason or another the direct force of Western arms could not be used to remove an inconvenient leader, the favoured mechanism of the West's intelligence agencies has come to be the so-called \"Colour Revolution,\" of which there have been several, not all named after colours.\nColour Revolutions are inevitably portrayed by Western media as the work of idealistic reformers -- and sometimes they are. They are viewed in many corners of the world, though, as a form of asymmetrical warfare practiced by the United States and other Western powers to effect regime change.\nUsually Colour Revolutions begin with mass demonstrations by opponents of the regime, who often identify themselves with a particular colour or symbol -- orange in Ukraine, green in Iran, yellow in the Philippines.\nIndeed, Putin's government has taken specific measures against Colour Revolutions, including a ban passed last year on U.S.-funded non-governmental organizations and the creation this year of a Russian National Guard equipped for decisive action against such disturbances.\nSo, could the United States be the next target of a Colour Revolution?\nOn the face of it, this seems as unlikely as, say, a Trump victory in the presidential election.\nYet we know that there have already been several days of mass demonstrations all over the United States by opponents of Trump -- so far focusing on his racism. For the moment, those demonstrations seem to be waning, but organizers promise more and bigger to come.\nWe know that American security agencies -- specialists in organizing and assisting Colour Revolutions abroad -- have been very unhappy at the prospect of having to tell President Trump their secrets. Speaking through a former Central Intelligence Agency director, the intelligence community recently signalled its deep unease at the idea of a Trump presidency.\nWe know that the Trump transition team has been leaking like a sieve, with stories of firings, deep policy disagreements and increasing attacks on the President Elect by members of the Republican Party's own establishment.\nThese are all warning shots across the bow of the Trump presidency. Is it possible that Trump, a political dilettante, does not understand how serious a predicament how could soon find himself in?\nIf he does recognize he has a problem, perhaps Putin, who has faced and survived a similar challenge, can advise him.", "Still, the Pentagon on Thursday brushed off Putin's boast of developing \"invincible\" missiles, claiming the United States was fully prepared for anything that might come its way.\nWashington: Russian President Vladimir Putin's claim to have developed a new generation of missile that is impervious to any Western shield has highlighted a gap in America's already imperfect missile-defense network.\nIn a national address Thursday, Putin described several advances in missile technology, including a hypersonic weapon that can fly at many times the speed of sound and evade existing missile-defense systems.\nWhile experts are deeply skeptical about how close to operational such a missile might actually be, US officials in recent weeks have sounded growing alarm about the potential threat.\nHypersonic weapons under development by Russia and China -- as well as by the United States -- can beat regular anti-missile defenses as they are designed to switch direction in flight and do not follow a predictable arc like conventional missiles, making them much harder to track and intercept.\nGary Pennett, director of operations at the Missile Defense Agency, said the potential deployment by America's rivals of hypersonic weapons -- which could be launched from planes, ships or submarines and carry either nuclear or conventional payloads -- would create a \"significant\" gap in US sensor and missile interceptor capabilities.\n\"The key challenge to US national security and the security of US friends and allies is the emergence of new threats designed to defeat the existing\" ballistic missile defense system, Pennett said recently.\nIn its proposed $9.9 billion requested budget for 2019, the MDA is asking for $120 million to develop hypersonic missile defenses, a big increase from the $75 million in fiscal 2018.\n\"We are not surprised by (Putin's) statement, and the American people should rest assured that we are fully prepared,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Russia has been developing \"destabilizing weapon systems\" for over a decade in direct violation of obligations to non-proliferation treaties.\nBut despite the Pentagon's claims, America is far from capable of stopping all types of missile attack, a fact it has lived with since the Cold War.\nWhile it has had some limited success in developing interceptors capable of stopping one or two missiles from a rogue regime like North Korea, a barrage of nukes from Russia or anywhere else would be unstoppable and trigger the \"mutually assured destruction\" of both nations.\nBarry Blechman, co-founder of the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan anti-nuclear proliferation think tank in Washington, scoffed at both Putin's claim to have developed a new hypersonic arsenal, and the Pentagon's rhetoric that it is prepared to meet any threat.\n\"We don't have effective defenses, so we are not prepared to deal with an attack,\" Blechman told AFP.\nBut US officials increasingly are turning attention to trying to improve the Pentagon's own offensive and defensive hypersonic technologies.\nThe military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which innovates and develops new warfighting technologies, is working to improve America's own hypersonic missile capabilities.\nDARPA Director Steven Walker said the agency is working on several projects, including two in partnership with the Air Force, to develop hypersonic engines and weapon prototypes.\n\"If you look at some of our peer competitors -- China being one -- and you look at the number of facilities they have built to do hypersonics, it surpasses the number we have in this country and is quickly surpassing it by (a factor of) two or three,\" he told reporters Thursday.\n\"It is very clear that China has a focus on hypersonics and making it one of their national priorities,\" he said. \"We need to do the same.\"", "A recent safe gun storage event in Fife drew hundreds of people and led to the giveaway of 350 gun lock-boxes and trigger locks.

It\u2019s only a proposal, and imperfect in the way it deals with transit and potentially takes money from the state general fund. But it shows new effort after last year\u2019s Senate failure. The proposal has some bipartisan support. Importantly, it pays to widen Interstate 5 at the traffic choke point along Joint Base Lewis McChord and to complete State Route 167 into Tacoma.\nOlympia police are still looking into a spate of 26 commercial burglaries reported last month. The crime wave was offset by a sharp drop in residential break-ins. What is driving the crimes \u2013 which don\u2019t appear to share a common pattern \u2013 is not so clear to police, who are hoping to catch sight of suspects on security footage.", "A wristwatch communicates a personal sense of style perhaps more than any other accoutrement this side of a pair of well-made shoes or expensive glasses or sunglasses.\nSure, those items might be more easily noticed, but it's the timepiece that's the definitive man's style statement that has stood the test of time for over a century with greater impact, more pervasive influence.\nNo matter what watch you wear, you're making a statement about who you are and what's important to you.\nThe more pragmatic, lower cost brands like Timex and Casio fall too far on the side of utilitarianism and speak more to your frugality than your sense of style, while the high end brands like Richard Mille and Bvlgari step over the line of classic iconic style and into the realm of gauche \u2014 created more for pure show than for anything within the realm of serious timekeeping.\nAnd then there are the true elite horologicals that exude timeless style, never seem to age and are recognized globally as the best in design, quality, timekeeping ability, value over time and style.\nWe've chosen five premier brands that are respected all over the world, not just by the horological cognoscenti, but by anyone who understands the impact of a man's wristwatch on his whole ethos.\nRolex is the world's most recognized watch brand. The Swiss watchmaker has been around since 1905 and stands as the single largest watchmaker with production numbers of 2,000 timepieces per day. This is an astronomical number for a high-end watch brand.\nBig as they are, they've managed to build and maintain a reputation of secrecy and mystique that few brands can match. They've also attained status in the forefront of most men's minds as a strong symbol of success.\nRolex also happens to be the most copied brand in the world, and not just in the form of cheap knockoffs that turn green in the shower.\nThe Rolex Submariner design is emulated by dozens of brands. These homage watches are often well-made but not nearly to the specifications or rigors of Rolex timepieces. This is why Rolex can command higher prices. Discerning people are willing to pay for a Rolex, whether it's a brand new $5,000 version or a $150,000 vintage timepiece.\nTo run down the litany of Rolex's accomplishments reveals its ethos of sophisticated sports luxury. Rolex can boast fine achievements, like the first waterproof wristwatch in 1926, the first waterproof case to 100 meters in 1953, and the first chronometer certification all the way back in 1914.\nBut a man wearing a Rolex does not automatically convey success, sophistication, masculinity and style. Just like a man who buys a Ferrari and peels the tires at every intersection while wearing licensed Ferrari apparel from head-to-toe, wearing a Rolex watch to draw attention automatically disqualifies its wearer as someone to respect.\nIf you wear a gold and blue Rolex Presidential and enjoy four-button suits, lizard shoes and talk about yourself in the third person regularly, then you're likely abusing all that Rolex stands for in the name of getting attention.\nIf you, however, see a Rolex timepiece as a subtle but timeless style statement, like pairing a Savile Row bespoke two-button charcoal gray suit with a vintage Submariner, then you clearly understand the Rolex brand and understand what it conveys in the way of class and under-the-radar masculinity.\nRolex's most popular and iconic example is the Submariner, which can be categorized as the gentleman's sport watch. He sails because he's passionate about the sport and ends the evening with a glass of Highland Park single malt.\nTimepieces from the International Watch Company might command around the same price point as Rolex, but their renown in consumer circles is wholly different.\nConsider IWC the thinking man's watch brand largely because the choice to buy one is deliberate, as opposed to picking a Rolex, which can be the logical and popular choice for those who have the necessary capital without horological knowledge.\nSelect a timepiece from IWC and you're in elite but cult status. Their designs are classic, elegant and timeless (except for the Top Gun or Aquatimer). The Portugieser is one of their most prominent and coveted watches.\nOne look at it and you realize you've graduated into another realm of wristwatches that's subtly powerful and understatedly confident.\nA man who wears an IWC is confident and has nothing to prove in the way of style. He might be a family man who has not lost himself in the shadow of responsibility. He's passionate about comfort and security, he's typically conservative, he knows what he likes, and he's comfortable in his own skin. He cares little that his neighbors know nothing about the IWC name and doesn't care to brag about his accomplishments.\nYou might see him driving a vintage BMW 8-Series or a Saab 9-3 Viggen because he appreciates obscure finery, and his suit of choice is a crisp navy blue Brooks Brothers two-button.\nOmega SA's sporting reputation in the watchmaking world is solidified by their commitment to creating timepieces that are a draw for adventurers, athletes, sportsmen, and even astronauts. Their watches are elegant and lean toward an active aesthetic that's still firmly grounded in a premier lifestyle.\nOmega is one of the few watch brands that has mastered toeing the line between active and luxurious with skilled perfection.\nOmega is committed to the world of sports. They're the official timekeeper of the Olympic Games. They have created a massive database of every athlete in the world for every major sport.\nOutside of the Summer and Winter Games, Omega also handles the timekeeping for every major international sporting event. This level of commitment goes far beyond the desire to make money from their watches\u2026 it is a way of life that the Omega brand stands behind.\nThe fact that the now coveted Omega Speedmaster Professional was chosen for NASA astronauts is also proof in the pudding that Omega's timepieces are created for extremes and extreme men. The same can be said for their expansive Seamaster line.\nA man who chooses the Omega isn't typically the wealthy businessman \u2014 they normally gravitate towards a Rolex \u2014 but you'll find avid downhill skiers opting for an Omega because it communicates style with power that's more subtle.\nHe drives a Land Rover Defender or a vintage Porsche 911, and he's less likely to spend a weekend in the Hamptons, instead opting for a visit the Circuit de la Sarthe for the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\nThe Parisian jeweler Cartier is all about regal sophistication. After all, they've provided jewelery to kings and queens and have grown to become one of the most successful watchmakers in the world.\nCartier watches are decadent without being gaudy. They manage to be luxurious even though one of their most famous timepieces, the Santos de Cartier, is a tank-style watch. It is one of the few enduring watch icons in the world.\nIt was created way back in 1904 for Brazilian pilot Alberto Santos Dumont to allow him to tell time while flying airplanes. Most men back then carried pocket watches, but Santos wanted it on his wrist.\nThe Santos wasn't the first wristwatch, but it's responsible for birthing the wristwatch industry, thanks to Dumont's fame and his flying prowess. The Santos de Cartier's legacy continues today as a sleek, stunning timepiece, and much more than a watch for pilots or pioneers to wear.\nThe Cartier name is now synonymous with luxury.\nA man wearing a Cartier cares about art and sophistication, and Cartier exudes both in luxurious style. Their designs are simple and elegant with fine touches like smooth cases, detailed crowns, and exposed screw bezels.\nHe's more apt to drive a car like a new Mercedes S-Class or a Bentley and wear custom made suits. He frequents the art galleries and considers a good Cabernet Sauvignon one of his best friends.\nFew men in this life will ever don a Patek. It's not a watch for the common man or even the mildly successful man. Patek Philippe is the ultimate power watch. It's widely considered to be the world's finest watch brand, creating in-house innovations that leave the rest of watchmaking in the stone ages.\nWearing one means you've arrived where others dare to dream. The designs are classic. The case has a smaller diameter than most, and they are some of the most coveted watches in the world.\nPatek timepieces regularly hit stratospheric prices at auction for rare vintage pieces. One Super Complication sold at auction for over $24,000,000 in 2014.\nPatek's reference 5270 Perpetual Calendar Chronograph is widely known as one of the finest watches in the world. Since its inception in 1941, it has graced the wrists of powerful men all over the world. The model boasts their first in-house chronograph movement.\nA man who wears a Patek is a connoisseur of fine watches, one of the most successful in his field, and revered f0r his intellect, his business acumen or his wealth. Men hope to merely walk in his shadow. He takes brilliant risks and makes them work to his advantage.\nHe doesn't shoot from the hip. He weighs his decisions carefully and is utterly relentless in seeing them through to fruition. He is more likely to buy a British estate than a mansion in Miami.\nHe drives an Aston Martin DB5 when he's not being chauffeured in a Rolls-Royce, and his wine cellar is bigger than your garage.\nHe wears custom made suits primarily in flat black and vacations on the French Riviera when he has a moment to step away from the empire he has built.", "United Natural Foods, a major supplier for Whole Foods, said it saw an unexpected increase in demand last quarter, leading to record sales and higher guidance.\nUnited Natural Foods derives roughly a third of its sales from Whole Foods, according to FactSet.\nThis is another sign that Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition has led to a sales increase at the grocery chain.\nUnited Natural Foods, a major Whole Foods supplier, revised its full-year revenue guidance after seeing record sales and an unexpected surge in demand last quarter \u2014 another sign that Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition is leading to increased sales at the grocery chain.\nDuring the earnings call on Thursday, United Natural Foods CEO Steve Spinner said the company struggled to keep up with the unexpected increase in demand, causing the company to adjust its operation \"in real time,\" as opposed to being prepared months in advance.\n\"Our ability to respond and execute at a high-service and low-cost manner was challenged during the quarter,\" Spinner said.\nFor the quarter, United Natural Foods had record quarterly sales of $2.4 billion and raised its full-year revenue guidance to the range of $9.84 billion to $10 billion. United Natural Foods stock is up over 2 percent as of Friday afternoon.\nThis is the latest indicator suggesting Amazon's impact on Whole Foods' business growth. Last month, Whole Foods disclosed that its sales increased 4.4 percent year over year, the highest jump since the third quarter of 2015.\nAmazon has made a number of changes at Whole Foods since buying the grocery chain in June for $13 billion. It cut prices across the board and started selling thousands of Whole Foods products on Amazon.com. It also sells Amazon devices in-store and is expected to roll out special discounts for Amazon Prime members as well.", "Signing NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) is a fairly common practice. In fact, this often leads to carelessness \u2013 as the parties may not even read the document!\nYet this could be a huge mistake. Just look at the case with Facebook. The company had to shell out $500 million because a court believed that an NDA was violated. This involved Oculus Rift \u2013 which Facebook purchased \u2013 and ZeniMax, a gaming company.\nSo then, when dealing with an NDA, what are some steps to take? What can you do to protect your company?\nWell, before answering these questions, let's first get a backgrounder on the fundamentals. Note that an NDA is usually only a couple pages long and is focused on protecting important information, such as code, algorithms, strategies, sales lists and so on. And if there is a violation, there can be monetary damages as well as a court order to prevent further disclosures.\nNDAs are often used between two companies, such as with the early stages of putting a deal together. Although, they are also critical with employees and contractors.\nOften the main goal is to prevent your competitors from getting actionable information. Yet an NDA is also important for patents. Consider that if details of your innovation are made public then you may lose your rights to get this protection.\nNow an NDA is far from a cure-all. After all, if you fail to take basic precautions to protect your company\u2019s confidential information \u2013 such as by using secure storage -- then you may forfeit your ability to enforce the contract.\nA key part of an NDA is defining \u201cconfidential information.\u201d The temptation is to be broad (for example, the contract could use a phrase like \u201call non-public information\u201d). But this could be risky, as a court may deem this to be unenforceable. Because of this, you might want to provide various categories of information that will be protected.\nAnother big issue with an NDA is the term of the agreement. Again, it\u2019s important to be reasonable \u2013 such as providing for five years or so. The fact is that confidential information generally loses its value over time, which is especially the case in the fast-changing tech world. However, there should be a clause for the return of any confidential documents.\nIf there is a lawsuit, will the losing party pay for the legal fees? Drafting a clause for this can be a way of preventing legal actions that do not have much merit.\nWhere will the case be tried and what state\u2019s law will be used? Such things can be important if the other party is based in another state. In other words, it could be inconvenient to resolve a dispute.\nWill there be an alternative to a court trial? Keep in mind that mediation and arbitration can be quicker and much less expensive.\nAs for drafting NDAs, there are plenty of online services like Rocket Lawyer that can help out. There are even others that are focused solely on these documents -- helping managing the process -- such as Trustbot. But of course, when it comes to legal matters, it is always a good idea to get the help of a qualified attorney.", "Highland County commissioners Jeff Duncan and Shane Wilkin are pictured during Wednesday\u2019s session.\nHe cited the recent preliminary agreement with Corvac Composites, an auto industry supplier, as an asset to the Greenfield community. The Times-Gazette previously reported that the agreement concerns the acquisition of the existing 175,000 square foot property that formerly housed the RR Donnelley facility. The expansion will bring around 200 new jobs to the area.\nWilkin said on Wednesday that there are \u201ca few things to finish up before that is finalized.\u201d He added that Corvac Composites is currently in phase one of its evaluation of the property. According to Wilkin, the company and commissioners both did not foresee any possible problems.\n\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s going to be a great relationship,\u201d he said.\nCommissioners said that the hope is that Corvac will see the strong work ethic Highland County can offer to any new business.\nCommissioners thanked several individuals for their help with this project: Ohio Speaker of the House Cliff Rosenberger; Ohio Senator Bob Peterson; Katy Farber with the Appalachian Partnership for Economic Growth (APEG); and Highland County Board of Commissioners Deputy Clerk Nicole Oberrecht.\nCommissioners Jeff Duncan and Horst also thanked Wilkin for his work.\nCommissioners added that they are continuing to work toward the Leesburg Industrial Park becoming a \u201ccertified\u201d site. The Times-Gazette previously reported that commissioners are working with South Carolina company InSite to reach that goal.\nIn other business, Wilkin said he attended the yearly meeting for the South Central Ohio Agriculture and Community Development Fund (SOACDF). He said a total of $600,000 \u201ccould be gone after\u201d in grant funds. However, no company or county will receive more than $200,000.\nWilkin said there will be three competitive rounds for the region that includes Highland County. Also in that region are Adams, Brown, Clermont, Gallia, Jackson, Lawrence, Pike and Scioto counties.\nWilkin said round one will be from July 1 through Sept. 30, round two will be from Oct. 1 through Dec. 31, and round three will be from Jan. 1 through March 31.\nCommissioners added that they will be looking for someone to represent the farming community on the SOACDF board. Duncan previously filled that position; however, as a commissioner he can no longer act in that role.

They also affirmed their ongoing commitment to the ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) framework and Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA).\nThe pair also completed the review of the bilateral defence relationship framework and agreed for further cooperation between the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF).\n\"On behalf of Singapore, Dr Ng expressed his gratitude for SAF training opportunities in NZ and for the NZDF to train together. Mr Mark noted that Singapore is New Zealand\u2019s closest defence partner in Southeast Asia, and the history of collaboration between the SAF and NZDF demonstrated the warmth, strength and maturity of the relationship,\" MINDEF said.\nThey also acknowledged the longstanding collaboration between the two countries on overseas peace-support missions, including in Timor-Leste, Afghanistan and most recently in Iraq as part of the Defeat-ISIS coalition.\nDr Ng expressed support for New Zealand\u2019s co-chairmanship of the ADMM-Plus Experts\u2019 Working Group on Cybersecurity with the Philippines while Mr Mark expressed New Zealand\u2019s support for Singapore\u2019s chairmanship of ASEAN in 2018, MINDEF said.\nMr Mark added that he was looking forward to attending the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in June.", "The Detroit Red Wings have given themselves a shot of confidence, and one of their rookies has a shot at a bigger role.\nThe Wings head into Tuesday\u2019s game at Columbus (7 p.m., Fox Sports Detroit-plus) buoyed by how well they played in earning their second victory of the season. They\u2019ll be short one if not two regulars up front, as Frans Nielsen is out and Andreas Athanasiou is doubtful, both because of undisclosed injuries. Nielsen\u2019s absence, means Michael Rasmussen will take shifts at his natural center position. Coach Jeff Blashill complimented Rasmussen for how he played in Sunday\u2019s 4-2 victory over Dallas.\nThe Columbus game will be Rasmussen\u2019s 10th, which triggers his entry-level contract. He can still be sent back to juniors (he is not AHL eligible because he has a year left of junior eligibility) but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s a likely outcome.\nPart of Rasmussen\u2019s adjustment is learning the speed of the pro game, and learning how to use his 6-foot-6 body against men, rather than the teenagers he played against in juniors. He\u2019s still looking for his first goal, but he has had some nice chances. He has one assist.\nThe Wings haven\u2019t won much but there\u2019s budding confidence within the team that they\u2019re better than their 2-7-2 start, especially with how well they performed Sunday.\nThe Wings scored twice in the first half of the third period to take a 3-1 lead, and kept attacking, playing a smart, puck-possession style. They only took one penalty all game. The Stars took the lead in the first period, but the Wings stayed structured \u2014 something that\u2019s been an emphasis since the routs in Boston and Montreal.\nLarkin mentioned after the 4-3 overtime victory at Florida that previously, the Wings would be rattled when an opponent scores. That has happened even through losses against Tampa Bay, Carolina, and Winnipeg.", "Living with epilepsy can be a real balancing act. When epileptic seizures are not well-controlled, one never knows when a seizure might hit. Life can be significantly pinched.\nBut being active need not be a casualty. According to an April 1, 2010 article on Medscape.com, the American College of Sports Medicine has encouraged those with epilepsy to embark on an exercise program that fits their needs.\nThe ACSM offered reassurance that in fact seizures are unlikely to happen while exercising, and the more you exercise, the less likely you are to experience a seizure.\nRegular exercise can enhance your immune system, increase your energy, lower stress levels, regulate weight and help you get a better night's sleep.\nIt's important to consult with your neurologist before doing anything else. Be sure to take any medications as directed. A certified health and fitness professional can work with you and your doctor to develop a safe program.\nIf you're a beginner, start small, with short workouts of 10 to 15 minutes. You can slowly increase your activity to half an hour, up to five days a week.\nLater you might consider adding strength training twice a week. The ACSM recommends one to three sets, 10 to 15 repetitions each. If you flourish on this level, you might want to try to add more days a week.\nYoga is gentle but effective exercise. Ehow.com suggests practicing qigong for 15 to 45 minutes at a time.\nIt was believed in the past that exercise would likely cause seizures but this view is changing. So is the belief that people with epilepsy need to live protected and limited lives.\nAn Ncpad.org article from April 11, 2011 maintained that appropriate exercise may reduce the frequency of seizures, especially aerobic exercise. It can relieve depression, increase cardiac health and promote a greater sense of well-being.\nIf an activity has ACSM approval that's a good start. For epileptic whose seizures are well-controlled, sports are even a possibility.\nOf course, precautions and safeguards should always be in place. For people who haven't been active, moving right into extreme exercise may cause seizures.\nI also have seizures and I always had petite seizures around my period. Then I started going to the gym every day and started noticing around my period I either had no petite seizures or maybe 2. I was so happy! The more I did it the less I had them. Exercising really does help I very surprised that it was something as simple as exercising to keep my from having petite seizures. So I encourage people with epilepsy to go work out! It really works!!!\nWhile I really find this article valuable, I am hesitant to share it with my friends who have epilepsy. The reason being, when you use \"an epileptic\" or \"the epileptic\", it segregates those with epilepsy into a crowd of their own, as if they are a subset of humanity. This is not true. That's what the new \"people first\" mantra is all about. Our health conditions only make up a small portion of our identities. It sounds wrong to use that as a way to identify people entirely. Let's define them as people firs! Please use the term \"people/individuals/person with epilepsy\" whenever possible. It is more supportive, uplifting, and humanizing :) Thanks!", "The U.S. Men\u2019s National team has lost three of its first five games under Jurgen Klinsmann\u2018s reign as national team coach \u2013 scoring just 2 goals, and questions must now be raised about if he is the right coach for US soccer.\nUntil the 80th minute when Jaime Ayovi got in front of substitute Tim Ream to head in the game winning goal this match seemed destined for a draw. Both Ecuador and the US created scoring chances, but neither team threatened to breakdown the opposition\u2019s defense. Goals in this match would come from capitalizing on mistakes and not moments of skill.\nIn the 80th minute the US were punished for a mistake.\nThe group stage of the 2010 World Cup is now over for the United States, and while the Yanks were three minutes from being eliminated, they will now advance to the knockout rounds. As the team prepares for Ghana on Saturday, TSB is grading each player on the team based on their performance in the group stages. Part One will look at the teams goalkeeper and defenders, and Part Two will look at the midfielders and forwards.\nTim Howard: A. Yes, Timmy has let in three goals in the tournament, but those three were far more about lackadaisical defending than any goalkeeper error. Howard has been near spotless, coming up with huge saves in the first match against England and putting in assured performances against Slovenia and Algeria. In a tournament where we have seen many a goalkeeper gaffe, Howard is looking like one of the world\u2019s best.", "One of the more interesting outcomes of the current economic pressures facing the public sector has been the springing up of new organisational models based on the social enterprise idea.\nDavid Cameron has been keen to embrace this as part of his Big Society approach, placing social enterprise models at the heart of the Coalition Government\u2019s \u00ecdeep and serious\u00ee reform of public services.\nThe communications sector, always looking for new and better ways of doing things, has jumped on board and a number of ex-government PR officials and civil servants are now bunching together to see what kind of organisation they might set up to deliver communication services through such a model.\nWill it work? Well, that depends on how you measure success. The PR industry, created roughly half a century ago, can clearly demonstrate substantial success by most people\u2019s reckonings \u2013 financial bottom line, personal reward and achievement, and of course successful client outcomes.\nBut social enterprises are not private PR businesses, nor are they in house PR departments. They sit somewhere between the two \u2013 not publicly owned, nor owned by private sector businesses either.\nAs such, the success of a social enterprise is far more focused on becoming self sufficient, and on generating not just a Return on Investment, but a Social Return on Investment. Employess need to be personally committed to \u2013 and motivated by \u2013 the aims and objectives of the wider community of which they are part.\nIt is not enough merely to love your clients \u2013 you also need to be an active participant in the sector in which they operate, too. Performance and performance-related pay will depend on it.\nIt\u2019s an innovative approach and of course recessions are one of the most powerful driving forces for innovation, new creative ideas, and successful new businesses.\nBut that is not the only reason we should take an interest in social enterprises in the communications sector. They also fulfil an extremely important role in being able to retain talent in critical sectors at a time when many expert practitioners are leaving those sectors to enter new ones, or even to start new roles which move away from PR and communications altogether.\nIt is a major challenge to retain high quality PR talent in sectors which, by their very nature and especially in the public sector, are being hardest hit by the current economic climate.\nFor that reason alone, the new breed of social enterprise communications models deserve our support, and deserve to succeed.", "Northeastern running back Traveon Freshwater (with ball) scored three touchdowns against D.H.

Two other children are reported fighting for their lives. The French news reports said the dead are a teacher and two children, and that two other children were badly wounded.\nThey said a man opened fire on people waiting at a school drop-off point and then fled on a motorcycle.

AP reported that two French paratroopers were shot in the town of Montauban, near Toulouse, on Friday, when a gunman on a black motorbike pulled up at a cash machine and opened fire. An 11.43 mm. weapon was used in that attack as well, according to the news reports.\nPolice saw a connection between those killings and to another deadly shooting of a soldier in Toulouse just over a week ago. Making the connection might obscure the anti-Semitic character of an attack aimed specifically at a Jewish school.", "Leaders of some large academic medical centers and community hospitals called for Governor Deval Patrick to examine how Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital, and a few other institutions are able to obtain higher prices from health insurers even though there is, especially for the most common procedures, often no demonstrated difference in the quality of the care delivered by those hospitals.\nHospital executives and state officials say the practice of insurers paying substantially higher fees to a handful of powerful Boston medical centers is imperiling some rival hospitals and distorting the greater Boston healthcare market.\nMarshall Carter, chairman of Boston Medical Center, in a letter to Patrick said that a Globe Spotlight Team report Sunday \"shone a very important light on the widening inequities in our healthcare system.\"\n\"The disparities in payments from private insurers to certain favored providers without a clear connection to quality or greater cost efficiency should trouble us all,\" wrote Carter. \"The Globe Spotlight article demonstrated that so-called 'supplemental' payments do, in fact, come in different forms. For large and powerful hospitals that care for patients with higher incomes and the best insurance plans, those subsidies come in the form of higher payments from private insurers.\"\nThe Globe, citing private insurance data, reported that the favored institutions get payments from 15 percent to 60 percent higher than their competitors.\nThe higher payments have, in turn, contributed to the rapid rise in insurance rates paid by many of the state's residents, according to some health insurers. The greatest beneficiary of the higher payments is Partners HealthCare Inc., the parent of Mass. General and the Brigham, which has, by far, the highest revenues of any healthcare organization in the state.\nThe higher payment rates also apply to Partners' physicians, who earn 15 percent to 40 percent more than most other doctors in the state, and community hospitals that are affiliated with Partners, which receive at least 10 percent more than their peers, based on Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts rates obtained by the Globe.\nEllen Zane, president and chief executive of Tufts Medical Center, a major teaching hospital, said: \"Clout, over anything else, has driven insurers to disproportionately and inappropriately pay some providers more than others. There are huge imbalances in this market - not just between teaching hospitals and community hospitals, but among the various teaching hospitals.\n\"Tufts Medical Center offers the same [advanced] services as Children's and Partners, but is paid at unsustainably low reimbursement rates - well below our real costs.\"\nPaul Levy, chief executive officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said the Spotlight report confirmed problems he had long suspected.\n\"We had heard talk about these payment differentials before, but to see them in black and white is startling and discouraging for those of us who are pursuing a quality and safety agenda.\"\nAttorney General Martha Coakley, who's stepped up oversight of the state's nonprofit hospitals since coming into office in 2007, said government must do more to ensure a more level playing field among healthcare providers. \"It would be folly to say [healthcare] is an area where you can just say market forces\" will solve all the problems, she said.\nA Partners spokesman, Rich Copp, said in a statement: \"We agree that there is a healthcare cost crisis, but it is not unique to Massachusetts. While we take exception to a number of points that were made [in the Globe report], including the use of outdated data to compare the quality of patient care, we welcome a dialogue on these issues, and believe the community will benefit from an honest and open discussion of all sides.\"\nPayment rates to hospitals have long been shrouded in secrecy because they are contained in private contracts between insurance companies, such as Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and individual hospitals. The Globe obtained private insurance data compiled by the state Health Care Quality and Cost Council, and analyzed hundreds of payments for individual procedures - from simple X-rays to childbirth - to determine how much Partners and the other hospitals are paid compared with others in the state.\nThe data have been vetted for accuracy by the council and hospitals across the state, though Partners last week said it had raised concerns \"about the data and methodology\" with the council.\nYesterday the council approved the launch of a website designed to help consumers make informed decisions about their care. The website, slated to go live in early December, will show what insurers pay individual hospitals, and how the hospitals rank on quality measures, for dozens of inpatient and outpatient procedures.\nDr. JudyAnn Bigby, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said after the council's meeting that the data show that unlike many other industries, market forces will not automatically drive down costs for healthcare.\nAsked whether she was concerned about the role of market power in driving payment disparities between hospitals, Bigby said, \"I don't have any basis to suggest that the reasons why you see the differences has to do with market power. . . . I think what it represents is people want to go to the Brigham, they want to go to Mass. General, they want to go to Children's Hospital, they want to go to the BI.\"\nIn an e-mail to employees earlier this week, Dr. James Mandell, chief executive of Children's Hospital, said, \"While the high cost of our care is a direct reflection of the intensity of care that sick and vulnerable children require, this article reflects the kind of intense pressure and magnifying glass we will be under when it comes to our costs.\"\nDolores Mitchell, executive director of the Group Insurance Commission, which provides health insurance for state employees and some cities and towns, said an open discussion of hospital payments is crucial as the state tries to extend coverage to all residents.\n\"This is an issue that's been crying out for public discussion,\" said Mitchell, who is also a member of the quality and cost council. \"I can assure you that those of us who are purchasers of healthcare have been discussing it and anguishing how to pay the bills.\"\nPartners was formed in 1994 by the merger between Mass. General and the Brigham. It has grown to include other hospitals and facilities, affiliated institutions, and a physicians' group with 6,000 doctors, the largest in the state. It says it provides about 22 percent of the inpatient care in Eastern Massachusetts.\nPeter Holden, chief executive of Jordan Hospital in Plymouth, said the article on Partners illustrates a problem that has confounded many community hospitals: Patients choose large academic medical centers, which cost more, despite data that suggest smaller institutions can provide the same service with the same or better medical outcomes.\n\"People default to academic medical centers because there's this presumed level of quality that's not available locally, and that's just not true,\" said Holden. \"The perception has no basis in fact.\"\nA Globe examination of the available hospital quality data showed that Mass. General and the Brigham often score well on quality measures, but also sometimes rank lower than competing hospitals.\nMarcella Bombardieri and Scott Allen of the Globe Spotlight Team contributed to this report.", "Get the Magic of March app-Watch the tournament action!\nIt's Tournament Time!

What is a modern educator to do in such a disjointed, distraction-plagued world? \u201cI make teacher raps for my students\u2019 enjoyment,\u201d reports one such pedagogue, Scott Swanson, who has his own modest SoundCloud account to attest to his claim. Scott, known professionally and musically as Mr. Swanson, has thus far only shared three tracks with the general public. Of these, two appear to be at least nominally educational in nature: \u201cGoogle Maps Is The Best\u201d and the Harry Potter-derived \u201cRemus Lupin.\u201d A third, the fiscally-themed \u201cMoney Speakin\u2019,\u201d is said to have been \u201cwritten and performed by KingFro\u201d and is less instructional in nature than the other songs but may nevertheless provide some insight into free market capitalism. \u201cGoogle Maps,\u201d meanwhile, joyously mashes up the Lonely Island\u2019s \u201cLazy Sunday\u201d with M.O.P.\u2019s \u201cAnte Up,\u201d all in the name of geography. Swanson says of the track: \u201cWhen we learn about a landmark or other interesting place, we will often use GoogleMaps and use street view to see how it looks now. I really enjoy it and the kids don\u2019t seem to hate it.\u201d In 2015, kids not openly hating a lesson must count as a victory.\nBut it is the epic-length \u201cRemus Lupin\u201d which is truly Mr. Swanson\u2019s magnum opus. Clearly, as a teacher himself, Swanson has mad respect for this lycanthropic Hogwarts professor. Over a beat which samples John Williams\u2019 unforgettable \u201cHedwig\u2019s Theme\u201d from the Harry Potter movies, Mr. Swanson raps for a full seven and a half minutes about Remus Lupin, summarizing the plots of several of J.K. Rowling\u2019s famed YA novels along the way, highlighting Lupin\u2019s greatest achievements (\u201cteachin\u2019 kids important stuff, like dark art defense\u201d), and even throwing some shade at some of the franchise\u2019s unsympathetic characters, such as calling Draco Malfoy\u2019s dad a \u201chater\u201d and Malfoy himself a \u201chypocrite.\u201d A humble suggestion to Mr. Swanson\u2019s students: David Thewlis, the renowned English actor who portrayed Remus Lupin in five films, also lacks a hip-hop tribute track of his own. Since the actor\u2019s name has the same cadence as that of his character\u2019s, doing a \u201cWeird Al\u201d-style parody of \u201cRemus Lupin\u201d should not be difficult.", "Oct 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to recover on Tuesday as upbeat earnings reports from blue-chip companies helped ease jitters over the impact of an ongoing U.S.-China trade war and other global issues on corporate profits.\nShares of Morgan Stanley rose 2.6 percent and Goldman Sachs 1.5 percent in premarket trading after the two lenders wrapped up earnings from the top six U.S. banks, with better-than-expected quarterly profits, driven in part by higher equities trading revenue.\nUnitedHealth rose 2.1 percent after the health insurer beat estimates for quarterly profit and boosted earnings forecast for the year as it added more members to its health plans.\nIn what could be a lift for the recently turbulent technology sector, Adobe climbed 5.9 percent after the software company reaffirmed its current-quarter forecast and provided 2019 targets that eased concerns over the impact of a recent acquisition.\n\u201cA couple of inputs that caused a selloff off in the last two weeks such as rising interest rates, higher oil prices and the dollar have calmed down to rational levels and the market may be able to positively respond to that as we work our way through the earnings season,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B.

Elsewhere, the state handles licensing duties and investigates complaints.\nUnder the new contract, the annual budget of the county program will increase from $26.9 million to $41.8 million and will allow the county to hire about 70 more workers to conduct yearly inspections and investigate complaints.\nThe state will take over initial certification of facilities and some other licensing duties.\nDuring the first year of the three-year contract, when the county will be hiring and training new staff, the state will also take over investigation of complaints at facilities that do not provide long-term care, including acute care hospitals and psychiatric facilities.\nCounty officials said the change will lead to better oversight of care for vulnerable patients, but that the program still needs more money.\n\"We feel that this is a great step forward,\" said Los Angeles County's interim public health director, Cynthia Harding. \"It's a first step toward getting us to where we need to be.\"\nDebra Goode, a registered nurse with the county's health facilities inspection program, told the supervisors that the new contract will help to \"position us for future success.\"\n\"We know how critical the work is that we do in protecting the frail, the infirm and the developmentally disabled in Los Angeles County,\" she said.\nAdvocates were more skeptical that the elderly and disabled living in the homes will be better protected.

They also expected the Irish to try to draw penalties. No. 13 Grace King has a penchant for theatrics on challenges, Lafayette coach Mark Godwin said.\nLafayette was also sent film of one of the Irish's most dangerous players, Kenroy Rodriguez. Some who had played against Rodriguez felt that he could be taken out of the game if Lafayette had a man on him at all times. Others felt that would only increase his level of play.\nSo the Lions certainly had a proper scouting report on the Irish, but Godwin\u2019s emphasis was not on the opponent. He wanted his players to worry about themselves, not letting the Irish dictate how the game was going to be played.\nSo even when Grace King\u2019s Omar Sanchez scored his second of two goals early in the second half, giving the Irish a 2-1 lead, Lafayette didn\u2019t panic and change tactics.\nShortly after Sanchez\u2019s second goal, Julian Alansari\u2019s header off a Chandler Pumford throw-in found the back of the net. Late in the match, Jacob Dugas, who had just entered the game as a substitution, flicked in a deflection off a corner kick to give the Lions a 3-2 advantage. Jose Ventura-Castro put the game away with his second goal of the night, a beautiful strike off a free kick in extra time.\nThe victory sends Lafayette to the Division I quarterfinals, where it will play fifth-seeded St. Amant.\n\u201cWe stood by our guns,\u201d said Godwin, the Lions\u2019 first-year coach. \u201cWe didn\u2019t change our game plan. We kept playing the way we know we can, trying possess the ball, knock it around. We got a little direct at times, but that\u2019s because the game gave that to us \u2014 the way they were playing \u2014 as the game went on and certainly in the second half.\nLafayette was also seemingly unfazed by missed opportunities in the first half. Among the failed chances was a penalty kick late in the first half by Ventura-Castro, who has been flawless on penalty kicks throughout the season. On this attempt, however, he went with power instead of finesse, hitting the ball off the crossbar to keep the game scoreless.\nBut Ventura-Castro redeemed himself quickly, scoring the only goal of the first half in creative fashion.\nEven if the Lions didn\u2019t capitalize on every opportunity in the first half, Godwin was pleased with how his team created those chances. As the half went on, Lafayette began attacking out wide instead down the middle of the field.\nGodwin said the goals conceded by his normally reliable backline were a product of miscommunications, but it buckled down from there.", "Our teams are reviewing data to determine root cause...\"\nSo posted Elon Musk's SpaceX last week, in a laconic observation that could just as well read, \"One of our rockets is missing, and we don't know why.\"\nThe explosion took with it 4,000 pounds of vital supplies destined for International Space Station astronauts, along with one of a pair of docking stations that SpaceX was supposed to deliver to ISS for installation, enabling later docking of \"space taxis\" by itself and by Boeing with ISS beginning in 2017.\nOne week after the, um, SpaceXplosion, SpaceX still hasn't explained why one of its Falcon 9 rockets exploded two minutes into its launch. But here's what we do know.\nSo goes the old trope, but space does seem to be getting harder lately. As tallied by our friends at Spaceflightnow, we have now seen a total of three resupply missions to the International Space Station scuttled by exploding or off-course rockets in the past eight months. Orbital ATK lost an Antares rocket to catastrophic failure back in October, followed by a Russian Progress cargo ship going off course in April. Completing the \"law of threes,\" SpaceX has now lost its first operational Falcon after a string of 18 successful missions.\nThis bad news could get even worse for SpaceX, which is currently competing against Orbital ATK, Boeing, and others to win a renewal of its multibillion-dollar contract to provide Commercial Resupply Services to ISS through 2024. The good news in this regard is that at least one of SpaceX's rivals (Orbital) has suffered a failure of its own; so at least SpaceX is not odd man out. The bad news is that Boeing's record of uninterrupted successful space launches as part of United Launch Alliance could argue strongly in favor of NASA giving at least part of the \"CRS(2)\" contract to Boeing.\nAnd it gets worse. As recently as May, SpaceX appeared to be on a roll. With a record of safe space launches nearly as good -- if not as long -- as Boeing's, SpaceX won certification first from NASA, and then from the U.S. Air Force, making it officially one of the U.S. government's favorite space companies. Importantly, these twin certifications opened the door for SpaceX to compete for nearly $25 billion worth of U.S. government space launch business -- annually.\nOf course, this was before one of SpaceX's rockets blew up and the company essentially shrugged and said, \"We don't know what happened.\" Viewed side by side, we now have SpaceX and Orbital ATK recording two mission failures in their last eight months of flying, versus Boeing's record of 96 launches during the last nine years, with nary a mishap.\nThis contrast in records could make NASA, or the Air Force -- or both -- think twice about awarding SpaceX a full share of their future space launch work, whether SpaceX is \"certified\" to bid for it or not. It could even convince the U.S. Congress to lift its ban on United Launch Alliance -- of which Boeing is one half -- buying and using Russian rockets to send national security satellites into space. If that happens, a scenario that looked very real just a few months ago -- one in which SpaceX becomes the only contractor legally able to launch such satellites -- would no longer be something for Boeing to worry about.", "Now that the two are starting to overlap through things like UML plug-ins for IDEs and round-trip engineering as standard, the overall differences are becoming more pronounced than ever. IDEs stand out as being fast and lovely to use, whereas - with a few possible exceptions - modeling tools are slow and cumbersome. They force you to use the mouse - an eminently serial input device.\nWhile they're being left behind in terms of productivity, though, modeling tools are making headway with advanced features such as round-trip engineering - the ability to turn a UML model into code, and reverse-engineer code into a UML model. The model is as close to the code as it's ever been right now, meaning that there's little excuse for the model and the code to become out of sync.\nThere's still a huge gap when it comes to refactoring support, though. If the model and the code are really tightly integrated, then you'd expect to be able to perform operations on the code via the model elements.\nHow cool would that be, to be able to right-click on a class in a UML diagram and choose \"extract interface\", then have a little pop-up window that shows the before and after code segments? That would be true integration. It's certainly needed if the trend for integrating a UML tool into an IDE is to make any sense at all.\nDetailed design diagrams such as class and sequence diagrams are very nearly at the code level, so refactoring operations on these diagrams would be virtually the same as code refactorings. In fact, I can't help wondering why the UML support in NetBeans for example doesn't include the same right-click menu as in its Java editor, when you right-click on a class (including the refactor sub-menu of course).\nBut why stop at code-level refactoring? A UML tool operates at so many more levels than just code. There are business processes, requirements analysis, preliminary design, deployment and tests to consider.\nUML is also concerned with both static and dynamic models. A \"refactor\" submenu on a modeling element at these levels would more suitably be called \"prefactor\".\nWhat sort of prefactorings would exist under this sub menu? To answer that, we'd need to look at the nature of refactoring itself.\nRefactoring is all about improving the design of code without modifying its semantics. In other words, the result of a single refactoring is better-designed code that does essentially the same thing. There's also an implied caveat: if we look at Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) as a \"stack\" with analysis models at the top, and code plus unit tests at the bottom, refactoring operates at the code level.\nIt doesn't affect anything \"above\" it such as requirements or the preliminary or logical design. Prefactoring should operate at the level it's performed on. So prefactoring a use case - such as extracting a use case with an \"extends\" relationship to the original, for example - should only affect the use case, nothing at higher \"levels\". It seems reasonable, though, that a prefactoring would have a knock-on effect on the levels beneath it: change the architecture and you'd expect the design to change too.\nThis would be round-trip engineering on steroids: probably beyond what current tools can do, but it's the direction they should be heading in.\nMatt Stephens has co-authored Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML: Theory and Practice, which illustrates how to get from use cases to code using a core subset of UML, and Extreme Programming Refactored: The Case Against XP.", "Meet Theresa Marie Falvey, owner of State of Grace mind.body.spirit.

The Terrorism Act 2000, which became law yesterday, has broadened the definition of terrorist organisations to include those who plan violent protests in the UK (even if the protest takes place abroad). Members of, and fundraisers for, such organisations will be subject to the law.\nBut under the banner of cybercrime, hackers have also been written into the definition of a terrorist. Anyone who tries to \"seriously disrupt an electronic system\" with the intention of threatening or influencing the government or the public, and they do it to advance \"a political, religious or ideological cause\", then they're a terrorist.\nThis sounds like an impossibly vague law and critics are split on whether it will simply be unworkable or whether mild offenders will be treated as dangerous criminals. The scariest aspect to this is the combination of Acts that Friend of the People Jack Straw has seen fit to make law. A whole range of nightmare scenarios are easily visible.\nJack defended the law, giving the nightmare scenario of people disrupting hospitals or power suppliers by hacking into computer systems - although the government seems to be doing a good enough job with that on its own. According to Jack: \"This bill actually strengthens people's civil liberties.\"\nThe fact is that it is right to prepare strong laws against cybercrime as it will inevitably become a large problem very quickly as more and more of the world is networked together.

Alter writes that Axelrod clashed with another campaign stalwart, Stephanie Cutter, and that, for a time, they \u201cbarely spoke\u201d because Axelrod believed the super-aggressive and ambitious Cutter \u201chad accepted an invitation to appear on\u2026. network [TV] that was meant for him.\u201d Alter also writes that while Axelrod \u201cdidn\u2019t like to admit he was playing class politics, he did so early and often,\u201d going after what should have been Romney\u2019s strong suit, his business record, and making him look like an oligarch lacking heart, soul, and any trace of concern for society\u2019s less privileged.\nAxelrod may have lacked the blow-dried looks for TV, but he had no shortage of smarts and shrewdly saw the 2012 contest as a \u201ctrust\u201d election, while his opponents wrongly saw it as a \u201cchange\u201d election. Axelrod understood that \u201cDoes this guy empathize with me?\u201d was the key question, and that because the answer, Axelrod knew, was no, Obama had a clear path to victory.\nAlter also reports that the much-told story of Obama accompanying Michelle, to whom he was not yet married, to an interview at City Hall with Valerie Jarrett, then Mayor Rich Daley\u2019s deputy chief of staff, \u201cfor the purpose of deciding whether Daley\u2019s City Hall was good enough for his junior lawyer girlfriend,\u201d did not \u201camuse\u201d then-Mayor Rich Daley.

It\u2019s published by BBC Studios and Science World, with some input from South Africa. I have only seen it in one local shop, but I suppose it\u2019s on sale elsewhere.\nOne of the articles that fascinated me was a discussion on why big cats had evolved over the years, but not big dogs.\nThere don\u2019t seem to be any canine equivalents of lions, tigers, cheetahs or leopards. The theory is that dogs and cats are unrelated species and survive in different ways in nature.\nDogs are pack animals and rely on teamwork for hunting. They work together and basically surround their prey and chase them (I suppose I should say \u201chound them\u201d) until they drop from exhaustion.\nIn order to do this, dogs need to be tireless and speedy. Lightness is a bonus. Cats, on the other hand, hunt alone. They need to conserve their energy for a quick dash and a fierce kill. Size and weight obviously count.\nAs a cat lover I have often wondered why my cats spend about 16 hours of every day sleeping. I\u2019ve also noticed that a sudden noise, like a pot dropping on the kitchen floor, for example, will have a sleeping cat airborne in less than half a second. All that stored energy is explosive.\nI also find it interesting that humans adopted two such different species as their companions of choice.\nDogs were obviously used as hunting partners and fitted in well with the human style of hunting.\nHumans usually hunt in packs, too. A dog is your teammate. But cats? How did cats ease their way into the human environment?\nMy guess is that cats cottoned on to another human trait - laziness.\nIf you can lie around doing nothing all day and still be provided with food and shelter, man, you\u2019re onto a good thing.\nOf course, there\u2019s a price to pay. There always is. You have to develop the cute look (gets those humans every time) and occasionally exercise that hunting skill by bringing in a mouse. Humans are undecided about this.\nIt helps to be a clown from time to time, too. Pretend to fight with a soft toy or chase a ping-pong ball and those humans are hooked. Bread and circuses they understand since Roman times.\nI suppose cats are like politicians in a way. Useless and often irritating, but sometimes hilariously funny.

The choice usually boils down to dedicating one to three years to school as a full-time student or balancing full-time employment with part-time education for three to five years. A student's situation and the pros and cons of each approach usually guide the decision.\nA primary benefit of going to graduate school full time is the ability to complete your degree more efficiently. This can help you get the degree necessary to more quickly seek out higher level jobs. Also, full-time students usually pay less money in fees to attain their degree since they spend fewer semesters in school. Going to grad school full time also allows you to focus on studies and concentrate on your degree program. This may include participating in study abroad or internship opportunities.\nThe major drawback of completing grad school as a full-time student is the limits it places on your work opportunities. It is difficult to maintain full-time employment while also going to grad school. In some cases, you may have to give up a job if you want to return to school as a full-time student. Leaving the workforce for a couple of years can limit your professional network of contacts and cause you to lose touch with professional norms and skills in your industry.\nMany students who go to graduate school do so after working for several years in business or industry. They want to return to school to better career opportunities while remaining employed. This is the benefit of a part-time grad program. Additionally, students who go to graduate school while working often have more real-life examples and experiences to contribute to the classroom. They can more effectively connect what they learn to current professional work.\nIn contrast to full-time study, grad students normally pay more over their degree process because of higher fees. A March 2012 article in \"U.S. News & World Report\" indicated, for instance, that a part-time graduate student at Houston's C.T. Bauer College of Business would spend about $3,000 more on fees than a full-time student. Some colleges also offer a full-time tuition rate that is slightly lower per credit than if you attend part time and pay by the credit hour.\nTop Ranked Colleges of Education in the U.S.\nShould We Get Rid of Standardized Tests in School?", "On July 30, 2015, Gabriel Resources registered a request for arbitration against Romania with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a part of the World Bank, invoking Bilateral Investment Treaties (BIT) between Canada, the United Kingdom and Romania. Gabriel Resources is a Canadian mining company registered in Canada, with offices also in the U.K. On July 21, 2015, Gabriel Resources issued a press release, which made no reference to environmental studies published by Alburnus Maior, an NGO dedicated to protecting the Ro\u0219ia Montan\u0103 area in Romania where the mining company had interest in extracting gold. The gold resources at Ro\u0219ia Montan\u0103 are the largest in Europe, estimated at 330 tons of gold and 1,600 tons of silver in the four mountains surrounding the town of Ro\u0219ia Montan\u0103, if the mining were to use blasting and cyanide extraction.\nThe demands from Gabriel Resources began with the claim that Romania broke the BIT signed in Bucharest on May 8, 2009 between Canada and Romania (BIT Canada) and the BIT signed in London on July 13, 1995, between the U.K. and Romania (BIT UK).\nArticle 2 which stipulates that investors must receive fair and equitable treatment, and full protection and security.\nArticle 3 which stipulates that there should be no distinction between foreign and local investors, and that foreign investors must be able to reap the benefits of their investments.\nArticle 8 which stipulates that investments or the returns of investors shall not be nationalized or expropriated except for a public purpose, under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\nFor TBI UK, Romania broke, according to Gabriel Resources, articles 2, 3 and 5, similar to TBI Canada.\nOn June 30, 2017, Gabriel Resources registered a moratorium, asking for US$ 4.4 billion in compensation, based on the fact that Romania has not answered amiably to requests for resolving the dispute initiated in 2015. The first hearing in the case will take place between September 9 and 20, 2019, according to a Reuters article, which makes no reference to the ecological disaster caused by such exploitation and to the massive public protests over the years against this project. The article was published also in The Globe and Mail and CNBC.\nThe British economist Guy Standing describes in his insightful book, The Corruption of Capitalism, how the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) are abused by global capitalism to extract wealth from weak and poor countries. ICSID is part of the World Bank. The idea for such a centre appeared in the 1950s in Germany, where a group of businessmen led by the president of Deutsche Bank sought to establish an arbitration mechanism to protect their investments in developing countries. The idea was adopted by the World Bank, which created ICSID in 1964 despite opposition from the 21 developing countries targeted by this mechanism. Since then, ISDS has been incorporated in over 3,000 trade and investment treaties, including NAFTA (in 1994), the TPP (now defunct), and CETA (2014). Between 1959 and 2002, fewer than 100 requests for arbitrage have been registered, but at the end of 2015 there were close to 700, involving more than 100 countries.\nThese arbitration suits are a very rich source of income for multinational corporations and their lawyers. The nerve of these multinationals has extended the notions of fair and just treatment and indirect expropriation to cover anything that might affect their cashflow, and the definition of an investor can be extended to cover anybody that has a financial interest.\nThe ISDS system does not conform to principles of justice. Cases are heard in secret by arbitration tribunals, of which ICSID is the main one. A tribunal consists of three members, and in most cases they are corporate lawyers. One is selected by the corporation, one by the opposing state, and the remaining two choose the president. If they cannot agree, the president is selected by the president of the World Bank, who is an American. The United States has never lost a case.\nThe system is a scam created by corporations to serve their interest of extracting wealth from public funds. More than half of the cases up to 2015 have been won by corporations. States have won only 37 per cent of the cases, and if they win, they still need to pay arbitration costs that average $8 million, and in some cases as high as $30 million. One notable case is Guatemala v. Goldcorp (another Canadian mining company) where Guatemala was forced to keep the Marlin goldmine open after being threatened with ISDS arbitration, despite facing controversies and grave human and environmental problems. In other cases the arbitration offered compensation over $1 billion. Occidental Petroleum was granted a settlement of $1.8 billion against Ecuador, equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP, for terminating legally an oil concession contract, one year after Ecuador found Chevron responsible for causing damages to the environment in the amount of $18 billion.\nOn a larger scale, in 2014, ISDS offered a staggering $50 billion against Russia for nationalizing the company Yukos. Another example is Argentina, which, after the major economic crisis of 2001-2002, tried to implement measures for economic stabilization that affected foreign investors. These investors forced Argentina into arbitration asking for $80 billion in compensation, equivalent to 13 per cent of its GDP. Of 27 cases originating from these economic measures, 30 per cent were settled out of court, 44 per cent were won by corporations, and only 15 per cent were won by Argentina. In the end, the government was forced to pay $900 million, not including arbitration costs. These, and many other examples, are detailed in Guy Standing's book.\nCorporate Europe Observatory (CEO) noted in an article published on February 13, 2017 that CETA will have adverse effects for Romania in the case of Ro\u0219ia Montan\u0103 because it will facilitate access for Gabriel Resources to arbitration, therefore increasing their chances of plundering Romanian coffers. The full CEO report is here. The author of the report, Pia Eberhardt said that \"VIP rights offered by CETA to foreign investors are in reality a massive corporate coup. These rights will give powers to tens of thousands of corporations to demand enormous sums of public money and intimidate decision makers.\"\nThe Romanian people are poised to continue the massive opposition to the mining project, which they find greedy, aggressive, non-transparent, hypocritical, undemocratic, criminal, destructive, partisan, and anti-justice. The ISDS is very business-friendly with global capital. Romanian civil society has begun putting pressure on the Romanian government not to give in to corporate pressures. The people are simply demanding that not one penny from the Romanian budget -- intended to help pensioners below the threshold of poverty, or hospitals in disparage, or infrastructure in decay -- be paid into the coffers of a corporate plunderer.\nThere will be no Kinder Morgan in Romania.\nThis article was originally published in Romanian in Strada Democra\u021biei (Democracy Street).

The hotel opened four years ago on Sand Hill Road\u2014a veritable venture-capital office park\u2014near Woodside, home to many tech billionaires. Surrounded by three of the wealthiest Zip Codes in the country, its high-design interiors and higher-powered happy hours have given a county known for coding a new sense of cool.\nHalfway to the hotel, Rudolph pulls into Starbucks for his morning coffee. At the counter as he orders a tall Americano, Rudolph is surprised to see the word \u201cRosewood\u201d scrawled in pen on the barista\u2019s hand. Granted, he has just won a Wine Spectator Award of Excellence, but he is still curious as to why a Starbucks server half an hour away has tattooed himself with the hotel\u2019s name. He has to ask.\n\u201cExcuse me, why do you have \u2018Rosewood\u2019 written on your hand?\u201d Rudolph inquires.\nIt\u2019s Thursday night at the Rosewood and huddles of women wrapped in dresses tight as sausage casings circulate around the lobby. A steady flow of sky-high stilettos and colorful minidresses come in the front door. All head to the dark barroom to the left of the entrance. By eight P.M. many are paired up with younger men. After a drink or two, couples move away from the bar, getting cozy on benches by the fireplaces or under blankets and heat lamps on the deck.\nMany attribute the bar\u2019s crush of singles to area matchmaker Amy Andersen\u2014a self-declared \u201clove concierge\u201d and the founder of Linx Dating\u2014who first helped designate the bar a singles\u2019 destination.\nSo Andersen and Ericson set out to solve the problem. With its growing popularity, the Rosewood bar was the obvious setting. Four years ago, Andersen hosted her first \u201cLink and Drink\u201d event at the hotel. The announcement came in one of her seasonal newsletters, \u201cDating Confidential,\u201d in 2009. She counseled the men beforehand to change out of their baggy Palo Alto polo shirts and exercise pants, to dress up, and put their best side forward. After further advising clients to \u201cbleach your teeth\u201d and \u201cspray tan,\u201d she invited them to the Portico patio at the newly opened hotel. It would be the first of many events at the hotel. Thus, the Rosewood scene\u2014and its accidental by-product, Cougar Night\u2014was born.\nThe next morning, I meet Andersen at her office, a few miles away from the Rosewood, in the Allied Arts Guild in Menlo Park. The 36-year-old is the perfect face for a high-end dating service. Her bright-blue eyes pop out between thick rims of onyx mascara and impossibly long black eyelashes.\nShe does not advertise her dating service. Because her clients are high-profile, they do not want to be seen to be using a matchmaker. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit underground,\u201d she says of her business. \u201cIt\u2019s not available to the masses.\u201d With other shops in the arts village ranging from the Royal Bloom Boutique to the Barn Woodshop to the Portola Art Gallery, the name Linx Dating would presumably stand out. But Andersen stays incognito. Nestled among the cluster of low ivy-covered cottages with rows of flower beds in between, Andersen\u2019s suite is camouflaged behind a jewelry-and-gift storefront. She shares space with a designer friend so her office is not visible to passersby.\nIn the back room, Andersen has set up a full silver tea service with cheese and crackers, apple slices, red, white, ros\u00e9, and sparkling wines, and ornate goblets in which to serve them. Her fastidious presentation matches the flowery style of the furniture, the plush couches and candle-covered counters. Andersen is wearing a black chiffon dress and has her hair up in a formal chignon with blond curly tendrils hanging down in front. She expertly navigates the back garden in black stilettos as she explains how her services work.\nAndersen says she is now advising about 1,000 clients, many of whom work near or on Sand Hill Road and socialize at the Rosewood. She charges $500 for the initial screening, usually performed by Nina Ericson. \u201cA lot have been incredibly successful because of their analytical minds,\u201d Andersen says, \u201cbut women don\u2019t want to be out with a cyborg.\u201d If they make it past the screening, clients can choose four different premium memberships: silver, platinum, V.I.P. 1, or V.I.P. 2. Silver costs $20,000 and comes with eight introductions to potential mates. Platinum costs $30,000 and consists of 11 introductions over two years, plus date-preparation techniques, date coaching, wardrobe advice, and dinner recommendations and reservations. V.I.P. levels 1 and 2 are price-upon-request services for clients who have long lists of must-haves; in these cases, Andersen does her recruiting on Facebook or in a \u201cnationwide\u201d search. There are few successful Palo Alto engineers who have not received a Facebook-friend request out of the blue from Andersen. She is constantly trolling. \u201cI use Facebook a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cI can announce as a status update that I am searching on behalf of this client.\u201d She says that, in reading the 13-page applications of the Silicon Valley guys who hire her to meet someone, she finds so many who want Einstein-meets-Heidi Klum (the former being far more plentiful in Palo Alto than the latter) that she has assistants on staff to search social media for any likely possibilities.", "Before getting down to the full offerings of the week, I want to take this opportunity to remind \u2014 or tell \u2014 readers that this Wednesday there is one showing of David Bowie in Nicolas Roeg\u2019s science fiction classic The Man Who Fell to Earth in its only playdate in the area. This is the newly restored 35th anniversary print of the full director\u2019s cut. It shows at 7:30, Wed., Nov. 9 at The Carolina. And then there are four new films opening this week. Three of them \u2014 Immortals, J. Edgar, Jack and Jill \u2014 are mainstream releases and open at most area venues. The fourth \u2014 Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life \u2014 is in the realm of art house and is at The Carolina. Offhand, I\u2019d say that three of the four have the potential of being at least interesting.\nThe reviews for The Man Who Fell to Earth and Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life are in this week\u2019s paper, so there\u2019s not a lot of reason to go into them here \u2014 presupposing, of course, you\u2019ll actually read the reviews, which may be wishful thinking on my part. With that in mind, I will pause to note that The Man Who Fell to Earth showing is one of those things that comes under the heading of \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d \u2014 and I\u2019m not really exaggerating, since the likelihood of this coming around on the big screen again is pretty darn slim. Gainsbourg, while not a one-time affair, is such an unusual and even unorthodox approach \u2014 at least for these days (35 to 40 years ago, it wouldn\u2019t have seemed so odd) \u2014 to the biographical film that I want to recommend it very highly. That\u2019s kind of a roundabout way of saying you might want to catch it while you can.\nOK, on to the mainstream stuff.\nBack in 2006, Tarsem Singh (under the name Tarsem) made a pretty terrific movie called The Fall, which finally got a very small release by Roadside Attractions in 2008. It did not play Asheville \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure why because several less likely Roadside releases have (House, anyone?). I\u2019m not sure who got the worst end of that deal \u2014 Tarsem or audiences. Well, now he\u2019s back with a big-budget, heavily CGI mythological fantasy called Immortals, which is being touted mostly on the strength of it being \u201cfrom the producers of 300 \u2014 not my idea of a recommendation, though it will be in some quarters. There\u2019s an irony to all this in that one of the big claims about The Fall was its lack of CGI. (I suppose it\u2019s like the 1970s when Queen albums boasted using no synthesizers \u2014 an idea that hardly stood up in the next decade.) I\u2019m not four-square against CGI \u2014 it\u2019s a tool like any other \u2014 but I can\u2019t say the trailers for this ancient Greece dust-up between Theseus (Henry Cavill, Whatever Works) and the unstoppable army of King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke \u2014 well, why not?) don\u2019t quite enthuse me.\nAny doubts that award season is upon us are dispelled by the arrival of a new Clint Eastwood picture \u2014 especially, a historically significant one with Leonardo DiCaprio in heavy-duty Oscar-bait make-up as J. Edgar Hoover. No doubt mantles are being cleared for awards even as we speak. (Not wishing to be cynical, but Oscar does dearly love a heavy make-up. It clues the voters in that you\u2019re acting.) OK, I\u2019m not a big fan of Eastwood\u2019s movies. They don\u2019t tend to be to my taste, but I respect his tenacity in terms of sticking with his own style and I would never question his sincerity or his craftsmanship. With all that in mind, I\u2019m at least very curious about J. Edgar. It will be interesting to see how Eastwood \u2014 and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black (Milk) \u2014 handle the story of J. Edgar Hoover with his very public publicity and his very private (but heavily rumored) private life. It will also be worth seeing how the film manages to work up much in the way of sympathy for the man.\nWhat on earth is there to say about the latest Adam Sandler assault on popular culture Jack and Jill? Damned if I know. It\u2019s yet another apparently witless Sandler vehicle directed by Sandler\u2019s pet Christmas Tiger, Dennis Dugan. (If Dugan ever had an opinion beyond saying, \u201cThat\u2019s great, Adam!\u201d I\u2019d be stunned.) The trailer is far and away the most God-awful thing I\u2019ve seen all year, and that\u2019s saying something. I mean, isn\u2019t it enough that we\u2019ve already had one Adam Sandler movie \u2014 Just Go with It \u2014 this year? We needed a second? And we needed one in which Sandler plays his usual character and his identical twin sister? Really? Aren\u2019t there laws about this sort of thing?\nIt looks like everything of note with the the exception of The Black Power Mixtape is going to stick around for another week. Blackthorn and Margin Call will still be at The Carolina (with Blackthorn on a split bill), and The Way and Margin Call at the Fine Arts. Yes, I know I expected The Way to be phased out this week at the Fine Arts, but that didn\u2019t happen. Next week, however, expect something pretty tasty in its place. I can say no more.\nApart from the already mentioned The Man Who Fell to Earth, we have the usual run of films this week. The Thursday Horror Picture Show is running Larry Cohen\u2019s The Stuff (1985) on Thursday, Nov. 10 at 8 p.m. in the Cinema Lounge at The Carolina. This week\u2019s film from World Cinema is Sergei Parajanov\u2019s Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (1964) at 8 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 11 in the Railroad Library in the Phil Mechanic Building. Edgar G. Ulmer\u2019s Carnegie Hall (1947) is this week\u2019s Hendersonville Film Society presentation on Sunday, Nov. 13 at 2 p.m. in the Smoky Mountain Theater at Lake Pointe Landing, Hendersonville. The Asheville Film Society is showing Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper in Frank Borzage\u2019s Desire (1936) on Tuesday, Nov. 15 at 8 p.m. in the Cinema Lounge at The Carolina. More information on all films in this week\u2019s Xpress.\nThe big deal this week is, I suppose, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part: 2. Actually, considering the fact that the other two \u201cmainstream\u201d releases are Atlas Shrugged and The Change-up, there\u2019s no supposing about it. Generally, this looks like a pretty good week to go to the movies \u2014 you know, in a theater.\nThe folks at TCM have some pretty choice offerings this week, which makes for a nice change. On Saturday, Nov. 12 at 9:30 a.m. they\u2019re running Rouben Mamoulian\u2019s gangster film City Streets (1931). This is one of the most stylish gangster pictures ever made and it doesn\u2019t get enough recognition \u2014 even within the confines of Mamoulian\u2019s richest period (1929-1933). At 9:30 that evening, they\u2019re showing Ernst Lubitch\u2019s Trouble in Paradise (1932) , a film I unhesitatingly will call Lubitsch\u2019s masterpiece.\nOn Sunday, Nov. 13 starting at midnight they have another brace of Laurel and Hardy silent short films \u2014 Habeas Corpus (1928), Big Business (1929), Double Whoopee (1929), Angora Love (1929). Generally, Big Business is considered the best of their silent films, though I confess I\u2019m partial to Angora Love, which we are told (via a title) is \u201cThe dramatic story of a goat \u2014 a strong dramatic story.\u201d The goat in question attaches himself to Stan and Ollie when Stan feeds it a doughnut. (The wildlife roaming the streets of Culver City in those days was peculiar.) Unable to get rid of the animal, they have to sneak it past their landlord, who apparently has a strict \u201cno goats\u201d policy. Not only does this turn out to be more difficult than it might seem, but the goat seems to be rather fragrant (\u201cThere sure is a tang in the air tonight\u201d) and in need of a bath.\nMonday, Nov. 14 is a particularly good day. It starts with the George Arliss comedy The King\u2019s Vacation (1933) at 10:30 a.m., followed by The Glass Key (1942). The latter is a film that all admirers of the Coen Brothers\u2019 Miller\u2019s Crossing (1990) really do need to see. And at 10 p.m., they\u2019re showing Josef von Sternberg\u2019s Shanghai Express (1932) \u2014 a film that\u2019s welcome at my house any day of the week.\nIt\u2019s going to be interesting to see how Eastwood handles a man who was arguably one of the worst things that ever happened to the USA. I wonder if he\u2019ll cover Hoover\u2019s penpal relationship with Heinrich Himmler or his refusal to forward solid intelligence information about the Pearl Harbor attack to the Navy.\nI can only assume this is [i]Take Shelter[/i].\nI wonder if he\u2019ll cover Hoover\u2019s penpal relationship with Heinrich Himmler or his refusal to forward solid intelligence information about the Pearl Harbor attack to the Navy.\nI can only assume this is Take Shelter.\nActually, it isn\u2019t. That\u2019s been moved to December.\nWell then I\u2019m crossing my fingers for The Skin I Live In.\nLooking forward to Take Shelter and Marcy May. Could it possibly be Marcy May?\nUnless something changes \u2014 and it\u2019s been known to \u2014 Xanadon\u2019t\u2019s crossed fingers have done the trick. But it won\u2019t be long to wait for Marcy May.\nWell, since the Fine Arts has now officially announced that The Skin I Live In is on for next Friday, I think we can pretty safely assume that it\u2019s a go. This is perhaps the film I am most looking forward to, especially since it\u2019s looking more and more like a lot of the year-end tasty titles will not be here till January or even February.\nWell, since the Fine Arts has now officially announced that The Skin I Live In is on for next Friday, I think we can pretty safely assume that it\u2019s a go.\nYay! I finally caught up with Talk to Her just last night, partly under the assumption that I\u2019d be treated to another Almodovar flick soon. And wow! Now I\u2019m even more excited.\nespecially since it\u2019s looking more and more like a lot of the year-end tasty titles will not be here till January or even February.\nI fear that A Dangerous Method is lumped into that group. Say it ain\u2019t so Ken!\nSay it ain\u2019t so Ken!\nI wish I could, but it does seem a likely candidate.\nIs the Descendants opening next week in Asheville?\nThe only new \u201cart\u201d title this coming week is The Skin I Live In. As it stands now, it looks like Martha Marcy May Marlene is the following week and Like Crazy is the week after. It\u2019s unclear at this point how The Descendants is going to be handled by the distributor \u2014 or that\u2019s the last I heard from the bookers I hear anything from.\nThe Descendants is only in 433 theaters. Blame Fox Searchlight. They\u2019re the ones making the call. Figure the next week or two.", "Social Security's Reserves Grew by $35 Billion in 2016 -- So Why Is the Program in Trouble?\nSocial Security's reserves are now at $2.85 trillion, but don't expect it to last.\nAccording to the just-released 2017 Social Security Trustees' report, Social Security brought in $35 billion more than it paid out, and now has a whopping $2.85 trillion in reserves in the OASDI Trust Funds. Despite this surplus, the program is still expected to run out of money in 2034, at which point it will only be able to pay out about three-fourths of promised benefits. Here's why Social Security's financial condition is expected to deteriorate rapidly over the next 17 years and what could be done about it.\nIn 2016, Social Security's income was $957 billion, and its total expenditures including paid benefits and administration costs came to $922 billion, which resulted in the $35 billion addition to the reserves.\nAlthough the $836 billion Social Security collected through payroll taxes wasn't enough to cover the program's costs, an additional $33 billion was brought in through the taxation of benefits and another $88 billion came from the interest earned on the existing reserves.\nWhat's more, the program is expected to operate at an overall surplus all the way through 2021, so we should see the $2.85 trillion stockpile of reserves continue to grow for the next five years. Social Security's reserves are invested in special government bonds, which earned an effective interest rate of 3.2% in 2016, so you might think that Social Security is in good financial shape. And you would be right -- for now.\nStarting in 2022, the total annual cost of Social Security is expected to exceed the program's income. At this point, it will become necessary to tap into the reserves held in the OASDI Trust Funds in order to continue paying promised Social Security benefits.\nBasically, the American population is aging. The large baby boomer generation is reaching retirement age, and people are generally living longer and longer lives.\nTo put some numbers behind this statement, consider that between 1974 and 2008, there were between 3.2 and 3.4 workers paying into Social Security for every person collecting a benefit. By 2016, this ratio had fallen to 2.8 workers per beneficiary. In 2035, when baby boomers will be mostly retired, this is projected to fall to just 2.2-to-1. Simply put, not enough people will be paying in to the program to support the people who will depend on it for income.\nHow can we fix it?\nIn a nutshell, there are only two ways to fix the problem. We can cut benefits, which can take the form of a higher full retirement age, lower benefits for high earners, or across-the-board cuts, just to name a few possibilities.\nOr we could increase taxes to combat the expected deficits and keep the program viable over the long run without reducing Social Security benefits. The report estimates that the 75-year actuarial deficit for the OASDI Trust Funds is equal to 2.83% of taxable payroll. Since half of the Social Security payroll tax is paid by employees, and half by employers, this implies that by raising the payroll tax rate by 1.415% for employees and their employers, we could solve the funding problem.\nOf course, this is a simplified solution to a complex problem. For starters, it doesn't account for the phasing in of such a tax increase. Most proposed solutions involve a tax increase that's phased in over a number of years. Doing so would require an even more dramatic increase. Additionally, an increase in the payroll tax rate is only one potential tax-related solution. We could also increase, or remove, the cap on taxable payroll, which is $127,200 in 2017. We could do a combination of the two, or a compromise that consists of a combination of tax increases and benefit reductions.\nThe exact reform package that will ultimately be implemented (if any) is anyone's guess at this point, but the bottom line is that there is still time to fix the problem while Social Security is still on firm financial footing. The longer we wait, the more painful the fix could be.", "2017 started off looking bright, but then turned into a dark year for Pakistan\u2019s economy.\nThe year 2017 started on a positive note. Economy was growing, inflation was low, the rupee was stable, CPEC was progressing, Pakistan\u2019s credit rating had improved, and the stock market was racing. There was hope for better times.\nBut then, things took a turn.\nPolitical chaos hit the economy, and hit it hard. The chaos gained momentum with the formation of the Panama case JIT in April and then culminated with the Islamabad sit-in by a faction of the religious right in November.\nThe prolonged chaos changed the once hopeful sentiment. The economic narrative shifted to fiscal deficit, trade deficit, rising debt, setbacks for CPEC, an overvalued rupee, and a sliding stock market. Pessimism sidelined hope.\nLet\u2019s look back at the highlights of 2017.\nInflation, a tax we all pay, is perhaps the most significant economic statistic for ordinary Pakistanis. It remained at around 4pc. This is according to the Consumer Price Index by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), if you are willing to believe the Bureau.\nThat surely does not mean that the price level of essential goods is within the reach of common Pakistanis. What it means is that these essentials did not move much further out of their reach.\nPakistan's population has officially hit 207.77 million. This is the provisional result of the 2017 census data by the PBS. The data has been collected after nearly two decades and it has not been without controversy.\nThe compound annual growth rate for the population since 1998 turns out to be 2.4pc, well above the global average. Female population is 101.3 million or 48.76pc.\nThe share of population of Punjab and Sindh decreased while that of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan has increased.\nAccording to the Word Bank, Pakistan is the sixth most populous country following China, India, USA, Indonesia and Brazil.\nSBP kept the policy interest rate at 5.75pc, where it has been since May 2016. Credit to the private sector grew on a year-over-year basis in 2017-18 by 18.5pc.\nSBP says that the prospects of achieving the 6pc target of real GDP growth continue to be strong due to the availability of cheaper money and higher credit off-take by the private sector. Critics are bound to be divided on whether this is feigned optimism by SBP or an objective analysis.\nAnother statistic that is close to the hearts and minds of Pakistanis is the unemployment rate. Officially, it is around 6pc but not everyone is willing to believe it.\nThe credibility of economic data in Pakistan in general has long been subject to debate. But the unemployment number stands out because of the incredulity surrounding it.\nThe army of applicants applying for every advertised job in 2017 surely does not suggest unemployment is low. In one of its report, marketing research firm Nielsen puts the employment rate at 51pc, leaving the unemployment rate much higher.\nThere will inevitably be issues regarding definition and measurement techniques, but the wide gap between the public and private sector estimates leaves one scratching one\u2019s head as to what the unemployment rate really is.\nEconomic issues took a back seat for most of the year as the leadership got occupied with the ongoing political turmoil. The government was greatly weakened and its fragile writ was fully exposed in the Islamabad sit-in.\nFollowing the disqualification and resignation of prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the embattled finance minister Ishaq Dar has taken leave of absence.\nThe office of secretary finance and chairman of FBR changed incumbents. A new governor assumed office at SBP, and an acting chairman was appointed at Securities and Exchange Commission Pakistan (SECP) after the former chairman was suspended in the \u201crecord tampering\u201d case.\nIt has been a surreal experience watching all the key policy makers get replaced in a matter of months. The economic challenges were mounting, the economic leadership was conspicuous by its absence, and no one was counting the cost of political uncertainty.\nThere are great expectations from CPEC and they keep becoming greater. The seventh round of the CPEC Joint Cooperation Council took place in Islamabad in November.\nThe largest sector under CPEC is energy, where shortages have long been the bane of our economy. The government is now examining a proposal to replace the US dollar with the Chinese yuan for trade between China and Pakistan.\nAll, however, is not reported to be well with CPEC. There have been news items about potential setbacks with calls for greater transparency.\nRemittances, recorded at $19.3 billion during the last fiscal year, have long helped manage Pakistan\u2019s trade deficit. Unsurprisingly, of the total global remittances, 80pc are received by 23 countries, led by China, India, the Philippines, Mexico and Pakistan.\nThe World Bank\u2019s Migration and Development Brief says that Pakistan had witnessed 12pc growth in remittances in 2015, which moderated to about 2.8pc in 2016 and is expected to grow by a meagre 1.4pc in 2017.\nSBP\u2019s forecast for remittances for the current fiscal year is between $19 and $20 billion. The SBP in collaboration with Pakistan Remittance Initiative has introduced Asaan Remittances Account to help move traditional over-the-counter cash transactions to formal banking channel.\nRemittances during July to October 2017 have reportedly grown by 2.3pc and it is an open debate if the growth has slowed down as much as anticipated.\nUnlike some of the traditional economic indicators, such as inflation and unemployment, terror and political violence are not systematically measured and publicised in Pakistan. This is quite puzzling given that they have an unusually strong link to our economy.\nA report published in 2017 by the US State Department says that terror in Pakistan is on the decline. A publicly available data set says that fatalities from terror incidents were 1209 in 2017, down from 1803 in 2016.\nWhile terrorism is receding, its frequency is still disturbingly high and recurrent. The violent ending of the Islamabad sit-in by a faction of the religious right shows that political violence is very much alive and it is hurting economic activity.\nPML-N's government unveiled its fifth bugdet of Rs4.5 trillion, allocating Rs1 trillion to development projects and Rs920 billion to defence spending. The budget offered little good news for financial markets.\nThe tax rate on capital gains on securities was increased to a flat 15pc for filers and 20pc for non-filers regardless of holding period.\nA super tax of 4pc for banking companies and 3pc for persons other than banking companies earning more than Rs500 million was extended to 2017-18.\nHow the Federal Board Revenue has gone about increasing tax revenue has been criticised and the Board continues to be assailed for corruption. If critics are to be believed, the government is now set to miss all the major budget targets including the GDP growth of 6pc, containing budget deficit of 4.1pc, and increasing tax- -to-GDP ratio of 13.7pc.\nPakistan\u2019s stock market soared because large inflows by foreign funds were expected after the country regained entry into the MSCI Emerging Market Index.\nAnticlimactically, however, it was found that contrary to hype. The market had experienced more outflows than inflows because the MSCI Emerging Markets Index gave Pakistan a relatively low weight.\nTogether with mounting political uncertainty, rising deficits, disappointing budget, and fears of depreciation of the Rupee, the MSCI surprise was a hard blow for the investors.\nLater in the year, Pakistan\u2019s weight was further reduced during review of MSCI indexes. After rising 46pc in 2016, the KSE-100 index has fallen by more than 25pc from the all-time high it hit in 2017.\nThe market price-to-earnings ratio has slid down to about nine times but investors seem uninterested. On the bright side, in a welcome break from the past, and despite the very large movements in the market, there have been no chain defaults.\nIn a leap forward for PSX, its stock brokers sold 40pc of their shares for US $85 million to a consortium of Chinese securities exchanges, Pak-China Investment Company, and Habib Bank Limited.\nThe demutualisation, integration, and attraction of foreign strategic holding had been contemplated by SECP since 2002. It finally happened 15 years later in 2017.\nFollowing the strategic investment, PSX also got listed on itself though there was limited investor interest in its shares during the book building process. Many investors in Pakistan are still trying to get their head around the fact that the exchange itself has become a listed company.\nHBL, one of the largest banks in Pakistan, was rocked by a money laundering scandal that shook the entire banking sector. The Department of Financial Services of New York State alleged that HBL had committed 53 separate violations between 2007 and 2017.\nWhile details about the wrong doings remained sketchy, HBL agreed to pay a fine of $225 million. It is a huge amount, but still less than half the $630 million that the US authorities had reportedly assessed.\nInterestingly, news that all was not well at HBL\u2019s branch in New York had been appearing for a few years but had not gained public attention. HBL announced that its president and CEO is bowing out and so is its branch in New York.\nThe Companies Act 2017 was promulgated in May replacing the Companies Ordinance, 1984. A feather in SECP\u2019s cap, this is the longest piece of legislation ever approved by Pakistan\u2019s parliament.\nThis was a mega project many years in the making. The new act focuses on abolishing unnecessary requirements and benefitting from the use of technology. It envisages a softer regime for companies without public interest.\nAmong its many features are mandatory minimum quotas for women directors and persons with disabilities. This act will continue to touch each of the roughly 80,000 companies registered in Pakistan and the lives of millions of Pakistanis for many years to come.\nIMF says Pakistan has the potential to reach a tax-to-GDP ratio of 22pc but it remains just that: unrealised potential. New records of trade deficit were being set with such frequency that it became difficult to keep up.\n\u201cNever before in the country\u2019s history have imports been over two-and-a-half times of exports as they are now,\u201d lamented an observer, as trade balance worsened. The ratio of gross public debt to GDP, as reported by the SBP, remained above 60pc.\nThere has been ongoing speculation as to whether Pakistan would return to borrowing from IMF and face the painful adjustments. The government sought to buy time by raising $1 billion through sukuk at 5.625pc and $1.5 billion via eurobond at 6.875pc.\nThe oversubscription and competitive yields of the issues show the creditors of Pakistan are less concerned about our economic challenges than some of the local economists.\nThat the rupee was overvalued was being suggested. There were a range of estimates from 20pc to 40pc. There has been a bitter debate if devaluation has even worked for Pakistan.\nBut early in December, \u201cthe State Bank launched what appeared to the rest of us like an ambush\u201d and the rupee, that opened at 105.5 against the dollar, quickly hit 109.5, and has remained volatile since. Devaluation is not without consequences but it is uncertain by how much it will fuel inflation.\nAs per the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources, Pakistan may run dry by 2025 if the present conditions continue. In another report by Institute of Public Policy, there are five challenges on the supply side: water scarcity resulting from higher demand and diminishing capacity of reservoirs, excessive conveyance losses, deteriorating infrastructure, high operation costs and an excessive groundwater use.\nThe Supreme Court called upon the chief ministers of Sindh and Punjab expressing concern over the lack of availability of potable water.\nATM skimming hit the headlines towards the end of the year. HBL confirmed that Rs10.2 million had been stolen from 559 accounts. The scandal was far from huge.\nWe are talking about less than 1,000 people and just about Rs1 crore in the whole country. But the media outcry it generated was indeed huge.\nOn the bright side, the media outcry created more awareness about cyber crime than the National Response Centre for Cyber Crime under the FIA could ever expect to achieve through its awareness activities.\nLooking back, 2017 started off looking bright, but then turned into a dark year for Pakistan\u2019s economy. This unwanted twist was not caused by bad luck or a natural disaster. It was very much the making of powerful Pakistanis eager to play a game of thrones.\nThey put their ambition, their ego, and the glory of their institution above that of Pakistan. None of them came out a winner.\nBe it any party or the parliament, the judiciary, the army, or the media, all have suffered reputational damage during 2017. But there has been one clear loser: Pakistan.\nDirty politics trumped development economics in 2017. It could have been a much better year for Pakistan\u2019s economy, but it was not.\nWell written article. To the point, whenever economy started getting better we ourselves put it towards worst case scenario. Thanks to our great politics. Lets see what Imran khan can do besides dharnas and dirty politics!\nExcellent very comprehensive economic review. Specially how dirty politics during the last one year has ruined the country economy.\nThe economic damage which is affecting the masses in the form of depreciation of rupee, high inflation, stock exchange going down for which IK and his team is responsible and the SC should act against them for the immense damage caused by dharma's and anti-govt policies of IK. This shows the honesty of IK, this is the patriotism of PTI towards Pakistan. What is the fault of the masses? why are we punished? Pakistan Economy was getting much better this year, but PTI does want it. I am pretty sure IK will not win next year elections as your contribution to Pakistan is only chaos and dharnas.\nSadly , there seems to be no end to this dirty politics , and with every passing day it's getting dirtier . People are bewildered . GOD save Pakistan .\nwhen stable democratic government is uprooted yet again, you can expect everything and anything.\n@arif so u say we let go crooks for the sake of economy or democracy.what you says about nawaz sharif disqualification.he was dishonest that is why he got punished.In fact we Pakistanis,not IK are responsible for electing such crooks who give damage to our country and economy.\nVery naive to blame it on dirty politics or rather call for accountability, it is hard earned reward for four years of unprecedented corruption and nepotism.\nA good balanced drawing room analysis though, yet ground realities are different. 2018 is being ending well in the sense that powerful corrupt elite is being trailed and rule of law is prevailing, which is fundamental aspect of long lasting prosperity.\nHere's hoping 2018 fairs better.", "NEW LOW PRICE!! \"\"New email feature in this version!If you play the strategy game Mafia (aka Werewolf) in online forums or at get-togethers, Mafia Boss can be there on your iPhone or iPod touch to keep track of the game's status.\"Mafia\" is a multiplayer game that is played in a group or online in a forum.

Mr. de Oliveira was 39, and despairing because he could not find work or pay child support for Lara or his other three children, but his ex-wife said they had no hint he was feeling suicidal.\nIn Guarani, they are called mokoi and gwyra. You can think of them like two small birds that fly to join you at the moment of birth and travel on your shoulder all your life. They are the guardians of your ayvu, your animating force, your soul. If you grow old, and your body wears out, then the birds depart for their natural home in the cosmos. That's a good death.\nBut the birds can also be frightened off your shoulder, long before your body wears out. They can be dislodged by harsh words, or by a shocking sight \u2013 your lover encircled in someone else's arms, for example. The birds may settle and return to you \u2013 but they may not. That is when trouble begins: The most evil spirits, the angue, that are around us and in us, can take over then.\nThe angue can lead you to do all manner of bad things. They may even give you the idea to pick up a rope, toss it over the branch of a tree, pull it tight around your own neck, and jump. Jejuvy, in Guarani: It is usually translated as suicide in English, but that's a limited word \u2013 the clear implication is that the angue suffocated you, after giving you a wish to die. And then the spirits are loose, and if no one is on hand to take steps to stop them, they can fan out to cause new suffering \u2013 including jejuvy in many others.\nOnce the hangings have started, it can be a very long time before they stop.\nJejuvy took hold in December, 2015, in Sassor\u00f3, an Indigenous reserve in central Brazil that is home to 3,800 people. The first to die was Junior Silveira, who was 20. He hanged himself from a large tree in a clearing between the houses. His family found him near dusk, and the chief, Paulo Fiel, called the police \u2013 but they are never quick to answer calls from the reserve, and it wasn't until the next day that Mr. Fiel was given permission to cut his body down.\n\"By then, everyone had seen, even the little ones,\" said Junior's mother, Maria Benites. Years ago, a child would never have been permitted to see a victim of jejuvy. These days, you can hardly prevent it.\nAfter Junior, the deaths came swiftly, a 15-year-old boy, a 14-year-old girl. Until the last to die: Junior's brother, Gilmar, who strangled himself with a belt on a post inside the family's rough board house in October.\n\"They were not sad boys \u2013 they were normal,\" Ms. Benites told me, her voice flat. \"They liked school. They played football. They went to dances. They were always together.\nMaria Benites looks at a photo of one of the two sons she lost to suicide over the past 15 months at her home on the reserve in Sassor\u00f3.\nThere is a suicide crisis among Brazil's Indigenous people, who take their own lives at an average rate 22 times that of non-Indigenous Brazilians. Among the non-Indigenous Brazilian population, it is men over 60 who are most likely to kill themselves (a statistic that is in line with most Western countries); on Brazilian reserves, it is almost entirely adolescents who take their own lives. More boys kill themselves than girls, but the rate of suicide by girls is growing more quickly. The overall Indigenous suicide rate is higher than the national one across the country, but it is wildly higher in a handful of places.\nThe situation has many parallels with the phenomenon of Indigenous suicide in Canada, with one conspicuous difference: In Canada, it is called a \"crisis.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged urgent action on Indigenous suicide, and cabinet ministers have promised a federal intervention (although Indigenous leaders say both a plan and resources are still starkly lacking).\nIn Brazil, however, there is no talk of a crisis. In 2015 the federal government announced a prevention plan for what it calls the worst-affected reserves (pledging to cut suicide by 10 per cent) but it will not make public the budget or where that plan is supposedly being implemented. This belated and haphazard response reflects, in part, the fact that the country is mired in economic and political turmoil that has pulled away resources and attention from most social problems. But even at the best of times, Brazil's 900,000 Indigenous people are profoundly marginalized, the poorest citizens, little remembered, less served.\nNo more than a dozen people in Brazil, a country of 210 million, are researching the possible causes of the astronomical rates of Indigenous suicide. Community-level resources are pitifully scarce: For the 70,000 Indigenous people in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where Sassor\u00f3 is located, there are 13 psychologists, none with more than an undergraduate degree.\nIt is difficult to determine precisely when this problem began, because data are predictably scarce: A federal Indigenous health service has kept statistics only since the mid-1990s. But suicides \u2013 occurring in such large numbers, not just one or two in a generation \u2013 are by all accounts a recent phenomenon. Most people the age of Ms. Benites, who is 52, say it never happened when she was young. The phenomenon first drew attention in Brazil with a spate of suicides among her people, the Guarani-Kaiowa, in 1986, when the Brazilian Indigenous affairs agency noticed a spike \u2013 from about five a year to 40. Statistics collected since 1996 show an average of 46 a year \u2013 a rate that is 21 times greater than the national one. Many of those who work in the field say this is probably a sharp underestimation, since Indigenous deaths are almost never subjected to a coroner's analysis, and are often simply not recorded at all.\nAs a series of suicides by young girls in Northern Saskatchewan made news in Canada in recent months, I went to Sassor\u00f3, and to reserves scattered through Guarani-Kaiowa territory, to try to understand what is happening here, and what, if anything, is being done in response. I talked to the psychologist whose catchment area includes the Benites family; to the regional health authority; to traditional healers and to anthropologists; to parents and siblings of the dead.\nWhen I asked people why they thought the young Guarani-Kaiowa are killing themselves, they told me about lost land and lost rituals, and the lure of the city and fancy sneakers and cellphones. About chronic disease and near-universal unemployment. About alcohol and drug abuse, and a generation of children whose parents feel they cannot control them. (And a generation of children who feel their parents should not try to control them.) I heard about the nature of the Kaiowa, some of whom described their people to me as closed, reserved, disinclined to share emotion but prone to sticking fiercely to an idea once it has entered their minds.\nAnd I heard about the mokoi and gwyra, the birds of protection that can be startled away. That explanation, in the end, made as much sense as any of the others.\nBrazil has 900,000 Indigenous people, and 480 \"demarcated territories\" encompassing just over a million square kilometres, 12 per cent of the country's land \u2013 land set aside for Indigenous people to live on. (Indians, as they are almost universally known here, have no ownership rights, or control of minerals or anything else beneath the soil.) Some 400,000 of those indigenous people live away from those demarcated territories, in rural areas or in cities.\nThe Indigenous people of the Amazon rain forest, with their bowl haircuts and yellow feather headdresses that are a National Geographic staple, are the archetypical Brazilian Indian. And 98 per cent of the demarcated Indigenous land is in the Amazon. But the second-largest Indigenous population in the country is here in Mato Grosso do Sul, a state on the western flank of Brazil that shares a border with Paraguay and Bolivia. There are eight First Nations in the state \u2013 \"ethnicities,\" they are called in Brazil; the largest, by far, is the Guarani-Kaiowa, who make up two-thirds of the Indigenous population and whose traditional territory is today fractured between the three countries.\nOn the Brazilian side of the border, the Guarani-Kaiowa have nine reserves in the south of Mato Grosso do Sul. This is breadbasket territory, the heart of Brazil's thriving industrial agriculture business. The land is a vast sea of green fields of soy, spiky sugar cane, and darker green corn, owned by a handful of giant firms, many of them multinationals. While the rest of Brazil staggers under the weight of a stalled economy, plenty of money is still being made here: The Asian market's hunger for Brazilian soy, and for beef fed on soy, has not dimmed. Once in a long while the farmland is interrupted by a town, built around a plaza, with a handful of clothing stores and gift shops, a couple of bakeries, and lines of big trucks idling at the one traffic light.\nYou can drive for 15 or 20 minutes at a stretch and pass only fields that are pasture for white Brahman cows. After a while, you realize that far more land here has been given to cows than to Indigenous humans.\nThe reserves are unmarked; you have to know what you are looking for to find them, down long, rutted, red dirt roads. Eventually there are houses in among the scrubby bush \u2013 the best ones a couple of low rooms with plaster over mud brick; the poorest, such as that of Ms. Benites, just tarp pulled over sticks. Each reserve has a school, where all classes except Guarani language are taught in Portuguese. The schools are chronically short of teachers and the most basic quality control. Just 5,400 Indigenous people in the state have made it as far as the first year of high school. There is usually a small health post on each reserve, where for a few hours each day an \"Indigenous health agent\" vaccinates babies and doles out tuberculosis medication.\nThere are plenty of trees between the houses, and a sense of spaciousness; there is also a total absence of any kind of economic activity. The teacher and the health agent are the only people on most reserves with paid employment. The only jobs to be had are day labour on the farms, a few months a year during harvest \u2013 but farmers don't like to hire \" \u00cdndios.\" Sometimes women get jobs washing clothes or floors for white people in the town \u2013 but it's far, and the work pays only about $20 a day.\nBrazil's Indigenous people had their first interactions with European colonizers in 1500, along the Atlantic Coast. So, some of them have more than 500 years' experience dealing with the mundo branco, the white world. But colonialism came much later to the deep interior of the country. The first plantation land grants in Mato Grosso (\"thick forest\" in Portuguese) were doled out to white settlers in the 1800s, but a major effort to control the movements of the Indigenous people began only in 1915.\nFor decades, most of the Guarani-Kaiowa managed to stay away from the reserves, and kept to the forests. But by the 1970s, the last swaths of forest were being cut down for cattle ranches and mat\u00e9 plantations, and the government drove the Guarani-Kaiowa off their land and into small reserves. The pain of the displacement was then compounded: Before they were moved, the Indigenous occupants were forced to act as slave labour, clearing the land for the new farms, and building the roads that would serve them; some were obliged to continue for generations as unpaid farm workers.\nThe relocation was, by all accounts, a catastrophe for the Guarani-Kaiowa. They were a semi-nomadic people used to ranging over large distances, suddenly denied access to their traditional means of supporting themselves. The forests were razed, the wild animals they hunted disappeared, and the water sources were drained to irrigate plantations. The relocations upended the Guarani-Kaiowa in another, terrible way: Particular places are essential for the practice of their rituals for planting, for hunting, for marriages and treating illness. A family's tekoha, its original and sacred land, is the source of teko pora \u2013 words that mean, essentially, to be alive and well. When they were \"interned\" \u2013 that is the word people usually use to describe the dislocation \u2013 everything began to fall apart.\nLeft: Youth in the village of Lim\u00e3o Verde on the Amambai Indigenous reserve pay desultory attention to a cultural presentation intended to build self-esteem.\nRight: Amambai rsidents attend a community meeting organized by SESAI, Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Health Agency. The agency has launched a new initiative to engage community elders and service providers such as police officers and pastors in efforts to lower the rate at which Guarani-Kaiowa people, particularly teens, take their own lives.\n\"The deaths, the murders, the suicides \u2013 they have to do with how we live now,\" Izaaque Jo\u00e3o, who lectures on Guarani-Kaiowa religion in a local college program for Indigenous teachers, explained to me. \"When people are mentally and physically well, it's fine, but when we're not, the spirit can get to us, because we're not protected. A way exists to protect the group, but what happens now is that shamans are not doing the rituals to protect the people \u2013 they have inadequate space to do it. To do it you need your proper place. It's a sacred thing that can't be sung anywhere.\"\nWe were sitting in front of his mud-brick house on a reserve on the outskirts of Dourados, a city of 215,000 people that is the largest in the region. Mr. Jo\u00e3o gestured briefly with his chin, taking in the jumble of houses down the road and the highway behind us that the government had recently carved through the centre of the reserve.\n\"This is not a sacred place \u2013 it's not purified. You can't do those rituals here.\"\nA few days after I met Mr. Jo\u00e3o, I went to see a shaman. I drove four hours along that highway, past soy fields that stretched to the horizon, to the Guarani-Kaiowa reserve at Amambai. It's a languidly bustling, cheerful community, with a well-built school and playing fields for kids. The town of Amambai is about 20 minutes up the road, so a few people go there for work. But the darker side of life here is also apparent: In the middle of the day, you come across women so high on something they can barely walk, leading a pack of filthy half-dressed children down the centre of the road. Amambai has been notorious in recent years as the community with the highest suicide rate in Brazil, a grim title it lost this year to Sassor\u00f3.\nEarly in the morning, I found Ilma Gomes, 58, at home, cooking something in a huge, soot-stained pot over a wood fire in a lean-to. Dried gourds doubled as dishes, animal skulls were stashed in the rafters, and mysterious leather bags of things hung on the stick walls; she was playing Guarani ritual music off a thumb drive in a laptop. She wore capri pants and a chiffon shirt; her silver hair was pulled back in an elegant knot.\nIlma Gomes is a Guarani-Kaiowa shaman who lives on the reserve in Amambai. After 17 people, mostly teenagers, took their own lives in the community in 2015, she and other traditional healers got together to perform rituals to strengthen the spiritual forces they said could protect the children.\nShe echoed what Mr. Jo\u00e3o had told me: Few people do the rituals any more. There are many rituals a Kaiowa must do each day, like taking herbal remedies, to keep the angue away. There are the steps a parent can take if they fear their child is menaced. There is a protective leaf they must use to wash their hair. Prayers they must say, to keep safe. But they don't.\n\"Lots of things now are out of control,\" she said, popping up and down from the bench where we sat, to stir the smoking pot. She described how all the youth on the reserve walk around with headphones on, looking at cellphones. \"There is a voice speaking right into their heads and they don't control what goes in their heads \u2013 this takes children into despair, it amplifies sadness,\" she said, in Guarani. \"They fall in love secretly and sometimes start drinking \u2013 without the control of the rituals they should be doing.\"\nSometimes mothers come and ask for her help with their children, Ms. Gomes told me. \"When the parent sees they are not well, it is the moment to intervene,\" she said. \"If no one notices, it's a problem.\"\nOften, these days, she said, parents are not watching.\nLeft: A pickup soccer game on the reserve in Amambai.

Their brother Allen, 16, was found hanging in a tree a year ago. Neighbours say he was frustrated his parents could not afford to buy him nice sneakers or a fancy cellphone. His mother believes jealous forces, human or otherwise, took his life.\nA few days before I met Ms. Gomes, on my way to Guarani-Kaiowa land, I went through the state capital, Campo Grande, and stopped in at the pristine blond-wood office of the state's Indigenous health service. There, I heard some of the data that lies behind the kind of fractured families Ms. Gomes would tell me about. I met with Edemilson Canale, who is in charge of the service, and Fabiane Vick, a psychologist who heads up the mental-health initiative.\nMr. Canale, a public-health expert, is Terena, one of the First Nations native to the region, while Ms. Vick is white, and did her master's thesis on Guarani-Kaiowa suicide. They talked about the high rates of violence in Guarani-Kaiowa reserves, of endemic domestic abuse, child sexual abuse, and incidents of assault; and about alcohol and drug abuse, which they said was widespread, even among children. Mr. Canale said that his chief preoccupation is child mortality \u2013 the Indigenous rate in the state is more than double the figure for Brazil as a whole \u2013 and both of them talked about how difficult it is to try to tackle issues related to mental health when many of the people they try to serve are malnourished and living in decrepit homes, problems outside their ostensible mandate.\nIn addition to the internal violence, there is external conflict, Mr. Canale explained: Since the 1980s, groups of Guarani-Kaiowa have been attempting to reclaim land they say is theirs, pitting them against agribusiness. The violence has intensified as the farms have expanded. Two chiefs were murdered in the past six years, and there were shootings, kidnappings and disappearances, leading to a constant sense of menace around Indigenous communities.\nMr. Jo\u00e3o told me about this, too: Attackers are rarely charged with assaults on \u00cdndios, he said, because the state and federal congress representatives are closely tied to agribusiness. State and federal military police often carry out evictions of Guarani-Kaiowa squatting on land they seek to reclaim; farmers use guards (with military-grade weaponry) from private security firms staffed mainly by ex-police.\nEvangelical churches have had a strong and constantly expanding presence on Indigenous reserves in the past 15 years, and, Mr. Canale said, forcefully discourage their followers from consulting traditional leaders or healers. The result has been disruption of communities and families. Izaaque Jo\u00e3o, the teacher of Guarani-Kaiowa spirituality, talked about that, too.\nGuarani-Kaiowa youth grow up with access only to poor education, with no recreational option beyond drinking \u2013 which they often start to do before they are 10 \u2013 or smoking the abundant marijuana that comes over the border from Paraguay, or crack, the health workers said; they have virtually no career prospects, and yet plenty of exposure to another, parallel life that they see on TV, and in the towns. Ms. Vick said that in interviews with families of teens who have killed themselves, parents say their children \"see everything, the televisions, the cellphones, the nice clothes, they see it and they want it but they live in another world.\"\nStudies of Indigenous youth in other countries have demonstrated the corrosive effect of \"increasing relative disadvantage.\" Although Brazil is currently facing a crisis of unemployment and inflation, real standards of living for most people here improved dramatically in the past 15 years. The poorest Brazilians \u2013 with the exception of Indigenous people \u2013 benefited most; fully 35 million moved out of poverty altogether. Almost none of that change reached the reserves.\nI visited 10 families on reserves in southern Mato Grosso do Sul who lost at least one member to suicide in the preceding year, and the stories the grieving parents told me had many common elements: He fought with his girlfriend. He was angry because I said he could not live with the girl he liked. My daughter was drinking. My son wanted new runners, and I said I could not buy them. \"They're banal things,\" Paulo Fiel, the elected leader in Sassor\u00f3, told me. But the conflict could be enough to startle off the mokoi and gwyra, he said, and leave a soul vulnerable.\nMs. Vick, the head of the mental-health team, said their epidemiological tracking shows that suicide comes in waves, something they are at a loss to explain. Mr. Izaaque, however, said it makes perfect sense: With no rituals to control the spirits that break loose in jejuvy, and no rituals of protection, the evil spirits wreak havoc on one person, and then the next.\nCattle ranching and industrial soy farming have taken over most of the land that was once Guarani-Kaiowa territory. Indigenous people have many land claims in the area registered with the federal government, but these take decades to be adjudicated.\nResidents of the Guarani-Kaiowa reserve at Amambai blocked a nearby highway in November to protest the fact that half the community had been without running water for nearly two months after a pump broke down. Protest leaders said that only blocking the highway brings attention from the Indigenous affairs organization that manages utilities and other services for the reserve. Police separated the protesters from angry white farmers wanting to use the road to get to town.\nChildren play in a schoolyard in Amambai. Guarani-Kaiowa youth grow up with access only to poor education.\nAraci Samor of Amambai lost her husband Nivaldo Chara Martin, 42, and son Michel, 15, to suicide.\nThe theory that roots the clusters of death by suicide among the Guarani-Kaiowa in the loss of their land is compelling, and it is cited in virtually all the research or public discussion about the issue. But it raises serious questions. First, why is it only the Guarani-Kaiowa? There are seven other Indigenous ethnicities in Mato Grosso do Sul, all with similar trajectories of dispossession, yet only this one has a suicide crisis.\nEighty per cent of Indigenous suicides take place in four \"hot spots,\" which are home to 40 per cent of the Indigenous population. The first is Mato Grosso do Sul; the other three are in the Amazon rain forest, among ethnicities that have dramatically different experiences from the Guarani-Kaiowa \u2013 they have not been driven off their land, they continue to practise traditional agriculture and hunting and handicrafts, and in many cases they are the dominant ethnicity in their towns. Two of the Amazonian communities share some features: They are in remote areas near borders with Colombia and Peru \u2013 where the federal government has made a push in recent years to increase urbanization and establish a Brazilian (that is, non-Indigenous) presence. There is a large military installation in each, and a growing influence of drug traffickers. But the fourth of the \"suicide hot spots\" is in a state to the north, in its largest city, with nothing in common with the other areas.\n\"The question of demarcation of land is an interesting lens to look at the suicides in Mato Grosso do Sul,\" said Maximiliano Ponte de Souza, a psychiatrist based in the Amazonian city of Manaus who is one of the leading (and, he points out dryly, one of the only) medical experts on Indigenous suicide. \"But that doesn't apply to the Amazon, which is where the largest Indigenous territories in Brazil have been demarcated.\"\nMost of the rain-forest communities share one feature: Starting in the 1950s, children about nine or 10 years old were taken from their families to live in a network of religious boarding schools run by Salesian Catholic priests, in an initiative enthusiastically endorsed by the federal government. The schools had a rigorous schedule that combined studying in Portuguese (Indigenous languages were forbidden) and manual work on farms. There have not been reports in Brazil of widespread sexual abuse in the schools, but then there has been no public accounting of the residential-school experience. Dr. Ponte de Souza says children were taken young \u2013 because that was viewed as the best way to break the cycle of passing on their community's spiritual beliefs \u2013 and in the process, missed the rituals for the process of becoming adults. The last of the schools was closed in 1986.\nThe loss of rituals features in a number of anthropology journals, but this is not a clear-cut explanation either: Each of the three Amazonian hot spots is home to a number of ethnic groups, but as with the Guarani-Kaiowa, only one such group, in each place, has a suicide crisis. In this, the Brazilian situation mirrors Canada's: There are Canadian Indigenous communities with epidemics of suicide, such as Northern Saskatchewan; and Attawapiskat in Northern Ontario, where more than 100 people tried to kill themselves in the past year. But there are also Indigenous Canadian communities where the suicide rate is lower than the national one. In a single geographic region, different First Nations have a marked difference in suicide rates \u2013 the James Bay and Northern Quebec land claim, for example, covers both Cree and Inuit; only the Inuit have elevated rates of suicide. Suicide in Canada is often connected with the residential-school experience, yet the largely Catholic communities that surround the former residential school at Chesterfield Inlet in Nunavut have some of the lowest suicide rates in the territory.\nIn Canada, there is research under way to try to understand why suicide occurs within some but not other groups with highly similar socioeconomic environments and experiences of colonialism. In Brazil, Dr. Ponte de Souza works out of a closet-sized office stuffed with what passes for an archive and struggles to scrape together funds to allow a graduate student or two to do field work based on interviews with a dozen people.\nIn Mato Grosso do Sul, I asked everyone I met why they thought the Guarani-Kaiowa are plagued by suicide, when other First Nations living on the surrounding land are not. Edemilson Canale, the head of Indigenous health services, said the Guarani-Kaiowa reserves are closest to the cities \u2013 giving people a sense of what they lack \u2013 but also located in the part of the state with the fewest employment possibilities. As a people, they were traditionally semi-nomadic, whereas the people of the Terena ethnicity, for example, always farmed, making the \"internment\" harder for the Guarani-Kaiowa.\nHis colleague, the psychologist Fabiane Vick, said her staff reports that the Guarani-Kaiowa are \"much more introspective and reserved than other ethnicities \u2026 our professionals find it very difficult \u2013 they don't share their emotions or suffering. It's locked away, even with their own people.\"\nBut Dr. Ponte de Souza said this line of explanation makes him uneasy. \"People seek answers in the sociocultural organization of each group and their differences. 'The Terena are more open in incorporating the new, unlike the Guarani-Kaiowa' \u2013 that kind of thing. This \u2026 places the blame for the suicide on the victim,\" he said. \"I ask, 'Is suicide perhaps a social strategy for diminishing suffering?' If I say 'Their culture is the cause,' I forget all the suffering that the community endured.\"\nIn every conversation about suicide he has ever had with Indigenous people of every ethnicity, he said, it is clear that they see it as a \"bad death,\" not desirable \u2013 so it is difficult to believe there is anything inherent in the people or their culture that makes suicide an acceptable choice, he added.\nIn Sassor\u00f3, I found Maria Benites sitting in a broken bamboo chair in the dirt patch between the two lean-tos where she and her grandchildren have been sleeping. They moved here from another house after Gilmar killed himself in October \u2013 most families choose not to stay in a house where jejuvy has happened. She got up and brought out a small, rickety bench for me to sit on \u2013 the best piece of furniture for a visitor. The combined material possessions of Ms. Benites and the two children and four grandchildren who live with her would fit in a laundry basket.\nNilcilene, 10, and Vera Lucia, 5, listen while their grandmother Maria Benites talks about two of her sons, who died by suicide in the past year and a half.\nShe said there was no warning sign that either of her boys was considering suicide. Junior, she said, was angry that she didn't want him to go to an all-night dance party with a friend she believed was a drug user. And when Gilmar died, 10 months later \u2013 he missed his brother, and he was squabbling with his pregnant wife. But she believes someone may have been envious of her good-looking, healthy sons, and put a spell on them. That, she believes, could unlock angue as well.\nAnd that makes her fear for the grandchildren. \"I think every day they might take the same path,\" she said. \"I need to find out who cast the spell, so they can't do the same to the others.\"\nBut the loss of both these boys, in just a year, has left Ms. Benites bone-achingly weary, with a sparseness to her movements and an even greater economy of words. Thoughts of those boys catch her mind and draw her away for long stretches, when she sits and stares into the middle distance.\nOne thing Ms. Benites did not tell me, something I learned later from the reserve leader, Paulo Fiel: Junior Benites had tried twice before to kill himself. No one in the family sought help, at the time, or later. None came to them.\nDr. Ponte de Souza told me he hears variations of this in many of the verbal autopsies he does with the families of suicide victims in the Amazon. \"In addition to saying that the people were 'normal' and 'fine,' family members also said that the person who died by suicide had already attempted suicide other times,\" he said.\n\"In other societies, this situation would be considered very alarming and not at all 'normal.'\" But the terrible frequency of suicide has served to normalize it. \"And although people have attempted suicide various times, they haven't sought help, either from the Indigenous health agents or from traditional sources.\"\nAnd although the deaths were recorded as suicide, help has not sought them, either. On the reserve in Amambai, I met Claudin\u00e9ia Rodrigues and Fernando Sarmori, who agreed to talk to me about their son, Allen. We settled together in the yard, as their daughters \u2013 a six-year-old with a grimy Barbie; an aloof 16-year-old \u2013 swung in a hammock in the yard.\nAllen was 16, in his first year of high school and thinking about a career in the military when he was found hanged in a tree near their home a year ago. Ms. Rodrigues sobbed and rocked from side to side, tipping forward so that her dark hair tumbled over to hide her face, saying she was sure someone had a hand in her son's death, then telling me that he had her cellphone and was wearing a new shirt she had bought him, on the day he died \u2013 words that sounded almost defensive, because the neighbours had told me Allen was angry at his parents that he couldn't buy a phone or new clothes. \"Why did they take the life of my son?\" she asked, and wept, and the \"they\" seemed as if it encompassed all who wished her ill, human and otherwise.\nMr. Sarmori, a tall, thin man, stood behind his wife raking distractedly at the dirt, and told me Allen wasn't the first, far from it: His father and his sister both hanged themselves. So did Ms. Rodrigues's brother.\nAnd yet, despite this, Allen's parents said that I was the first person to come to their home to ask about him and what was happening when he died. The first to ask about any of the suicides in the family. No mental-health professional has come, no one from the medical service or the reserve leadership, Ms. Rodrigues said. I heard this in every one of the homes I visited: No one has come. No one has asked.\nThe psychologist who covers this region is an earnest white woman named Monay Larissa de Souza, who is 29. For six years, she served the community \u2013 whose language she does not speak \u2013 alone, even as the number of youth suicides rose steadily. Last year, two more psychologists were added to her team. Now they are attempting to visit every home where someone takes his or her own life, in order to identify and try to track family members, she said \u2013 because they have learned that when there is one, there will usually be more.\nIn Sassor\u00f3, the psychologist assigned to the area is one of the few Indigenous professionals in the health service, a Guarani-Kaiowa woman named Barbara Rodrigues. (She doesn't speak the language either, because her mother, determined that she would get a good education, put her in a \"white\" school where she learned Portuguese.) She has been in the job a year, and says if she had known what it would entail, she might not have taken it. She hears stories of abuse, but says she has no way to intervene; stories of people in the community selling alcohol to minors, but can do nothing about it. \"It's a very frustrating job, I won't deny it,\" she said, in a late-night conversation on the porch of her home in Tacuru, the town near the reserve. \"I identify risks and tell the rest of the services, and nothing happens. I'm here to collect statistics \u2013 there's nothing else I can do.\"\nIn her lap, she held a pink, glitter-spackled folder of her case notes: interviews with family members and friends of the young people who killed themselves in Sassor\u00f3 this year. Each one was a litany of misery \u2013 of alcoholism, domestic abuse, unemployment, hunger for opportunities that didn't come. But the reasons family members give for suicides \u2013 \"they're just trivial things.\" It leaves her mystified. \"If I could say that's the thing that's causing it \u2013 fantastic, we'll go there and tackle it. But I can't say.\"\nMs. Rodrigues's concern was palpable, but I did not find it echoed everywhere. On the reserve in Dourados, I had a jarring encounter with the mental-health services. I drove up to the administration office and met the community leader. When I told him I was reporting on suicide, he replied, \"We had one yesterday! Or maybe it was two days ago.\" He summoned the psychologist on staff, Elizeti Moreira, and told her why I'd come. Ms. Moreira is Terena, the only other Indigenous psychologist working in the region. She reached into her pocket and drew out her mobile phone, thrusting it toward me to display a picture. \"He had been in to see me just two days before, and when I heard the news, I rushed right there to see if it was the same guy. And it was! Hanging here.\" She laughed in apparent amazement and shook her head. In the photo on her screen, a man in blue shorts hung from a mango tree, his neck crooked sharply to the left.\nPsychologist Elizeti Moreira looks out the window of the health centre on the Dourados reserve.\nShe led me to her office and read me her case notes from her meeting with Onildo de Oliveira. He was a father of four, unemployed and deeply troubled about his inability to find work. His former wife had had him detained for failure to pay child support once before, and he didn't want to return to jail. The children asked him for food, and he had nothing to give them. He went to apply whenever he heard about jobs, but the people hiring made clear those jobs weren't for \u00cdndios.\nMs. Moreira put his file down and repeated that she had had no hint he might be suicidal. I asked her what she would have done had she suspected he might be. She told me how, a year earlier, a woman of about the same age had come to see her, similarly desperate about how to feed her family. Ms. Moreira had got her a job washing clothes with a white friend in town, \"and then she was fine.\" But with Mr. Oliveira? \"Because he's a man, there's nothing I could do.\"\nI asked if I might be able to meet his family, and the leader told a reluctant Ms. Moreira to show me the way. As we drove up, through a thicket of trees, she pointed out the one where he had killed himself. His mother, Celestina Vilhalva, 58, tiny, hunched, with a weathered face, was crocheting on a bench outside the two-room house, but began to sob when we said we had come to ask about Mr. Oliveira; his former wife, Mara de Souza, 33, had a dazed expression on her face. They told me that he was a good man, who went to church, and didn't drink, and they had had no warning.\nMs. Moreira, the psychologist, interrupted to bring up the cycle of suicides that could be set off now.\nMs. de Souza shuddered. \"I don't know what this means for my daughter,\" she said.\nWhile we talked, five-year-old Lara ran back and forth in the yard, chasing geese into the tall grass, slowing a little, from time to time, to see if her mother and grandmother still wept.\nLeft: Alisson Ortis and Nicole Samoiri Martin, both eight years old, play in a tree in their yard in Amambai. Nicole lost her father and brother to suicide. Right: The da Silva siblings Miguel, 4, Bruna, 6, and Neto, 8, in the village of Jaguapiru on the reserve in Dourados. Child mortality in their community is more than double Brazil\u2019s national rate.\nDiscussion about the causes of Indigenous suicide in Canada often focus on the loss of language and cultural identity, and on how young people feel a lack of opportunities for their future. There is broad consensus that these are factors, although they raise the same questions \u2013 why some communities with these problems have high rates of suicide and others do not. Inuit communities have the highest suicide rates in Canada, but in most cases they have the highest levels, among all Indigenous peoples, of geographical, language and cultural continuity.\nSome of the newer research in Canada looks at intergenerational trauma \u2013 at the impact on the young people whose parents and grandparents were coerced into relocation, or abused at residential schools, for example. There is a focus on adversity in early childhood, and how it can play into suicide risk: There is strong evidence to suggest that children who are exposed to \"adverse environments\" \u2013 to alcoholism and drug use, to domestic violence, to sexual abuse even if they are not its direct victim \u2013 will develop impulse-control problems and have trouble understanding the consequences of their actions. It's a description that fits every one of the cases in Barbara Rodrigues's pink folder. But none of the mental-health workers in Mato Grosso do Sul had ever heard about this research.\nAt the end of 2015, with 17 suicides in Amambai, Fabiane Vick and her team began to implement the government's new suicide-prevention program there. It was the first organized effort in the Indigenous health service to address suicide, even though it was the leading cause of death for people under 30.\nThey got better vehicles, so they could travel to more parts of the reserves, and added to the staff. \"We did activities on 'valuing life' \u2013 talking about plans, dreams, goals, self-esteem \u2013 with the help of Indigenous health agents in communities,\" Ms. Vick said. They held meetings for pastors, leaders, and others in the community called upon to interact with the reserve, such as police and paramedics \u2013 and talked to them about identifying suicide risk, and prevention strategies. Last year, there were just four suicides in Amambai.\nMs. Vick and her team are understandably delighted. But the federal government did not make any provision for research to evaluate the impact of the intervention, or to compare the outcome to communities that do not receive it, so they have to base their plans on their faith that it is working. There was one suicide in Amambai in January, of a 26-year-old; there were none in February.\nMeanwhile, when I was in Amambai, I learned that there was another suicide intervention under way, another possible explanation for the decline in deaths. Ilma Gomes, the shaman, told me that last year, after so many children took their own lives, she and the other traditional healers got together and decided they needed to take action. Clearly these children lacked the forces that would shelter the mokoi and the gwyra, would keep them in place as the guardians against evil spirits.\nSo the healers began to do the rituals of protection, all of them together, at once, every day \u2013 in the schools and all the places where young people gather.\n\"We did it for three months. And then the dying stopped.\"\nNatan Obed: Indigenous suicide is no longer a mystery. So why the continued political apathy? Prevention requires an understanding of how social, political and health inequities negatively influence the environments in which children grow up, explains the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.\nGabor Mat\u00e9: How do we heal trauma suffered by native communities?

Changes include a sleek appearance that reflects the look of Windows 8, functional improvements, and tie-ins to SharePoint and SkyDrive for storing documents online. In addition, the various components of Office Web Apps improve productivity in the cloud, while Windows 8 Surface RT tablets get their own flavor of Office.\nModern Style Interface In keeping with the \u201cModern\u201d (previously called \"Metro\") style interface that you'll see in Windows 8, Office 2013 is getting a new look. Gone are the multiple shades of color that decorated the older interface, as well as the shadows and shading that suggested three dimensions. Instead, everything is minimalist, flat, and stark\u2014mimicking the tiles on the Windows 8 start screen. The only hint of frivolity exists in a watermark design in the top right corner of the screen. The idea is that the new look will help you focus on your work rather than being distracted by the objects decorating your screen. Whether the redesign will achieve this goal or not\u2014time will tell one way or the other\u2014I certainly like the crisper look.\nStart Screens Each app supports a new color-coded start screen\u2014blue for Word, green for Excel, orange for PowerPoint, green for Publisher. Like the other applications' start screens, the one for Word displays a list of recent documents. Though creating a blank document is the default option, you can alternatively select a template, search online for templates, or click Open Other Documents to search for a document on disk or in a SkyDrive folder. These screens will help new users find their way around more easily, and experienced users will appreciate having all of their options in one place at startup. The top right of the screen shows details of the SkyDrive account that you are currently logged in to use.\nSkyDrive Integration Office 2013 is designed to integrate with the cloud\u2014with SkyDrive and SharePoint, in particular. That's good news if you prefer to save your work online for anywhere-access, though most small businesses and individuals still save files locally. If you use SkyDrive, the account details wil appear in the top left corner of all the application screens, as well as on their start screens. Click your account details to switch accounts and to manage them. When you save a document, worksheet, or presentation, the application will default to saving to your SkyDrive account, but you can save to your local disk if you wish.\nSyncing Across Devices When you save your Office documents online, they\u2019ll be available to you (and others) from any device at any time, via Office 2013 on a PC or tablet, or via the WebApps. Microsoft has already upgraded the WebApps for Word, Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint with the new Modern-style look and Office application color coding. In addition, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint will save the last location where you were working before you saved--down to the letter, cell, or image. This feature makes it easier to pick up where you left off working, even if you open the file on a different device than you last used.\nTouchscreen use Some new Office 2013 features are designed to make working with a touchscreen easier. The new Read Mode in Word opens a document in reading view, which lets you scroll through the document by swiping horizontally with your finger. On a desktop with a touchscreen monitor, you can change this behavior back to the more traditional page navigation mode if you wish. Click the Touch Mode button on the Quick Access Toolbar\u2014to the right of the program logo of each application\u2014and the ribbon toolbar spreads its icons further apart for easier access to fingers. Apart from these useful changes, however, touch integration in Office is somewhat erratic. You can use gestures such as tap, pinch, stretch, slide, and swipe for various features.\nPDF Editing In the past you could save a Word document as a PDF file, but until now you couldn't edit PDFs in Word without first converting them to Doc or DocX format. The new Word 2013 can open PDF files, edit them there, and then save them as either DocX files or PDFs. When opened in Word, the file retains the structure of the PDF file, even for elements such as tables. This advance will be a big plus for many users, who can simplyopen a PDF and get straight to work.\nFormatting Task Panes in PowerPoint Formatting images, shapes, and other objects in PowerPoint is now more intuitive. Right-click an image and choose Format Picture to open the new Format Picture task pane, which shows the formatting options available for that object. Click another object, and the options in the task pane change to show only the options available for that object. You can leave the pane open as you work, so that it\u2019s visible without cluttering your workspace.\nEasier Charting For users confused by the plethora of charting options in previous versions of Excel, the new Recommended Charts feature is useful. Select the data to chart and click Insert > Recommended Chart to see options such as line, bar, and pie charts that the program recommends for your data. Click each chart to preview what your data will look like in that form. After you select and create a chart, small icons will appear outside its top right corner when you select it, giving you access to work with chart elements, styles, and colors, and with the chart data itself.\nAccount Login The Backstage View in Office 2013 applications (accessed via the File tab) includes a new tab called Account (or 'Office Account', in Outlook). Here you can log in to your SkyDrive account or switch accounts. You can also see a list of connected services, such as Twitter and Facebook, and add services, such as LinkedIn and SkyDrive. The Office Updates area gives you information about the status of any available updates. Click Update Options to disable or enable updates and to view a history of Office 2013 updates.", "Both Comcast and Time Warner Cable are now pushing for data caps on their broadband home services, similar to data limits set on regular cellular data plans.\nIn the fall of this year, Comcast initiated a trial run of capped broadband plans of which the lowest data caps were set at 300 GB per month. This Comcast feels is sufficient for the majority of its customers. The trial session was in the southern states, which included Atlanta, Nashville and Charleston which are major markets of the company.\nUnlimited data access on home internet services has boosted a flourishing growth in online activity on Internet-based applications. This growth in Internet usage can be hindered by the imposition of data caps due to fear of overage fees.\nThe data caps will allow Comcast to bill consumer\u2019s having excessive data usage, with overage fees raking in more money for the broadcasting company. If FCC allows Comcast to provide Internet \u201cfast lanes\u201d for paid content providers, it can give more power to the company. These \u201cfast lanes\u201d will exclude those companies\u2019 services data from getting capped.\nAlthough many consumer\u2019s will not like this new plan, they have little to no choice to stick with Comcast because in many markets there are absolutely no other options.\nComcast Drop Data Useage Cap.

This time it wasn't to tear down any slain opponents, but to talk up his team. The Seahawks, now Super Bowl champions after a 43-8 win over the Broncos, got there on the back of a stifling defense.\nSherman was the most prolific member, part of a secondary nicknamed the Legion of Boom, and a defense as good as any over the last decade.\nWith a composition of mostly unheralded players, Sherman went about naming then and their unlikely paths to this point.\nSherman was a fifth round pick, as was safety Kam Chancellor, K.J. Wright was a fourth-round pick, and on it went.\n\"We're a bunch of misfits in some ways,\" Sherman said.\n\"It's not a lot guys that people have heard of...It's not just the Legion of Boom.\"\nThe Seahawks got here by shutting down Peyton Manning at the end of a record setting season. The Broncos scored less than 27 points just once this season.\n\"It's not our standard to give up a lot of points,\" he said.\nAccording to Sherman, Chancellor had said before the game that he wanted to set a tone early. He did it with a first quarter hit on Broncos WR Demaryius Thomas.\nFrom there, the route was on. The Seahawks forced four turnovers, sacked Manning once but pressured him relentlessly, Malcolm Smith ran back an interception for a touchdown and made Manning look mortal.\nSherman got hurt late in the game, suffering a high ankle sprain \u2014 though he said X-rays were negative \u2014 but that won't deter him from reveling tonight.\n\"I'm as 100 percent as I can be for the celebration,\" he said.", "To love it or to list it?\nBefore Francine Achbar and her husband, Dr. Stuart Mushlin, committed to an extensive and expensive remodel of a condominium at Longboat Key\u2019s Promenade, Achbar embarked on a fact-finding mission that would determine the best lifestyle for the couple.\nAchbar interviewed six designers and ultimately invited Jill Geisdorf to plan the renovation that would involve modernizing the kitchen and three bathrooms, enlarging the master bath, creating illuminated display space for a studio-glass collection that belonged to Achbar\u2019s parents, taking down walls, creating a whole-house lighting system, and carving out more storage space throughout the 2,300-square-foot residence.\n\u201cWe have adult children who visit and we like to entertain,\u201d said Achbar, \u201cso I wanted the kitchen and dining area, den and the two balconies to function as party space and now they do. I can have 30 people here for a buffet brunch.\u201d The renovation took eight months, during which time the homeowners rented a house on Cape Cod and communicated with their design team by Skype, email, texts and regularly scheduled 6 a.m. conference calls with Geisdorf that Achbar said she missed once the renovation was complete.\nStuart Mushlin had only two major things on his wish list. The internist retired from a 40-plus-year career in medicine at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women's Hospital but he mentors younger doctors through a residency training program and he continues to consult. The author of the book \"Playing the Ponies and Other Medical Mysteries Solved,\u201d he also continues to write. Consequently, Dr. Mushlin needed a home office. But he also needed another specialized space. A jazz saxophonist, Mushlin asked for a small soundproof room where he could practice anytime he wanted to without disturbing neighbors.\nHe got both when the design team reworked a bedroom to function as a home office. Then they converted the walk-in closet into a practice studio. It\u2019s cozy and soundproof and the musician says it\u2019s just right for him. The doctor is an avid bridge player and golfs besides playing jazz saxophone. He also participates in a physician mentoring program at Sarasota Memorial Hospital.\nDesigner Jill Geisdorf of Chic on the Cheap brought associate Tori Wansley into the project and also Jeff Francola, owner of J&K Building and Remodeling.\nBoth designers and homeowners agree that flooring made a huge difference. \u201cWe took up cream-colored carpeting and put down wide-plank engineered hardwood in a white oak finish,\u201d said Geisdorf, \u201cwhich immediately updated the rooms. And improved lighting made everything better.\u201d The designers installed specialty lighting over the dining table with pin-point lights that make it seem like dining under stars at night.\nThe homeowners define their style as contemporary casual and favor white and neutrals with accent colors taken from a rug in the living room they already owned. Navy, cream and brick red from the carpet were introduced into the rest of the rooms through upholstered pieces, art work and accessories. They kept some of the furniture that was already in the condo and brought favorite pieces from a home they sold in Brookline, Massachusetts. The wall color throughout most of the residence is Hush by Benjamin Moore while the trim color is Lancaster White.\nThe master bath was enlarged, a separate toilet room was added as well as additional storage space. The designers removed a bathtub and expanded the walk-in shower. One of the other bathrooms, off the den, has a tile wall feature that speaks directly to Francine Achbar. Small black tiles form random arrangements of words and letters in white script and print. It\u2019s a giant puzzle or an opportunity to put together words and whimsical sentences.\nFor the past two decades Francine Achbar has been a panelist on ''Says You,'' a weekly hour-long syndicated word-game quiz show on National Public Radio.

This includes Sunni and Shia Muslims who are at grave risk, as well as tens of thousands of Christians and other religious minorities.\n\u201cWe cannot allow these communities to be driven from their ancient homelands,\u201d the President said, noting that already, allies are flying planes with the U.S. over Iraq, sending arms and assistance to Iraqi security forces and Syrian opposition, also sharing intelligence and providing billions of dollars in humanitarian aid.\nThe speech drew praise from Mark Arabo, a leader in the national Iraqi Christian community, including some 60,000 Iraqi Christians in San Diego County.\nOn the eve of the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in the U.S., the President emphasized that his highest priority remains the security of the American people. Targeting ISIL is the latest in a series of actions to take the fight to the terrorists, he observed. Those efforts have included killing Osama bin Laden and much of al Qaeda\u2019s leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as recent successful strikes against al Qaeda affiliate leaders in Somalia and Yemen\u2014efforts the President said have made American safer.\nAlthough ISIL calls itself the \u201cIslamic State,\u201d the President emphasized that the terrorist group is neither Islamic nor a state.\nAdding that ISIL\u2019s sole vision is the slaughter of anyone and everyone who stands in its way, the President detailed the threat that ISIL poses to Iraq, Syria, and the broader Middle East. And \u201cif left unchecked,\u201d he said, \u201cthese terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region, including to the United States.\nIntelligence sources believe that thousands of foreigners -\u2013 including Europeans and some Americans \u2013- have joined them in Syria and Iraq. Authorities voice concerns that trained and battle-hardened fighters could try to return to their home countries and carry out deadly attacks.\nThe President stated that America has the capacity and the will to mobilize the world against terrorists and to help Muslim communities in a fight as well for opportunity, tolerance, and a more hopeful future.\nHe said America will be remembered for helping to protect innocent people, such as stopping the massacre of civilians trapped on a mountain top after they had fled ISIL forces.", "Stock prices ended lower yesterday in slow pre-holiday trading as futures-related activity eroded the value of many stocks.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average dropped 8.16 points, to 1,900.87, as declines outnumbered advances by 872 to 657.\nThe market's decline was broad-based.

It illustrates just what Apple is trying to achieve when it comes to music, and content in general.\nYes, the 92-minute documentary, which came out on Friday, is engaging on its own. It could have popped up anywhere \u2014 Amazon, HBO, Netflix, or some other video hub \u2014 and made for interesting TV. It even has a wonderful twist at the end.\nThe video can bring new interest to existing Apple Music library content, across multiple genres. The subject matter of the documentary, the 808, has been used to produce hip-hop, funk, and dance and electronic music. Sure enough, Apple Music now stocks a playlist of songs from 808.\nThe movie includes commentary from several prominent music figures, including Afrika Bambaataa, Lil Jon, Questlove, and the Beastie Boys\u2019 Ad-Rock and Mike D, as well as people who have supported stars, such as Marvin Gaye\u2019s audio engineer Mike Butcher and Public Enemy producer Hank Shocklee. These appearances reinforce the notion that Apple remains at the center of the music conversation for artists and insiders.\nDirected by Alexander Dunn and produced by You Know Films in association with Atlantic Records, the movie even promotes some friends of Apple Music. Mike D produces \u201con-demand\u201d episodes for the service. Diplo, whose artist collective Major Lazer regularly produces episodes, offers his thoughts on the 808, as does Pharrell Williams, who runs the OTHERtone show. The narrator of the documentary is none other than Zane Lowe, one of the key anchors of Apple Music\u2019s Beats 1 radio.\nAnd, of course, this thing is only available on Apple Music. So if you\u2019re into electronic music, or music hardware, you\u2019ll want to sign up for Apple Music or renew your subscription. Personally, this is more relevant to my music interests than the two-hour documentary on Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 tour that came to Apple Music last year. And while I don\u2019t expect to like Apple\u2019s upcoming TV shows about apps or James Corden\u2019s Carpool Karaoke sessions as much as I like 808, those are sure to attract certain audiences in their own right.\nIf this were Apple\u2019s perfect world, there would already be an Apple video subscription streaming service for the Apple TV that would really give Netflix a run for its money. But, for one reason or another, we\u2019re not there yet. So Apple isn\u2019t going full-bore on video production yet. It has taken its time and made something that\u2019s in its best interests. Perhaps this release will turn out to be a prototype for music-oriented content that Apple will pump out on a regular basis.\nUpdate on December 14: Added references to You Know Films and Atlantic Records and comment from the film\u2019s publicist.", "The \u201cVale of Tears\u201d is an epic thread on the Top-Law-Schools forum that chronicles the lawyer unemployment crisis.\nTLS is pretty ruthless about telling it straight.\nA user on Top-Law-Schools or TLS, the forum where current and prospective lawyers speak candidly about the job market.\nShutterstock - A distressed man in a suit sitting on the ground, his head in his heads and resting on a briefcase.\nIf you\u2019re a lawyer or law student, you probably know Top Law Schools or TLS, the collection of forums with a religious following of people who currently are, or were at one point, obsessed with getting into law school.\nLaw schools initially ignored the employment crisis and continued to increase tuition. At first there were few critics from within the academy. In 2011, University of Colorado law professor Paul Campos began his blog Inside the Law School Scam. Shortly thereafter, Washington University law professor Brian Z. Tamanaha published his seminal book Failing Law Schools. \u201cMany law professors at many law schools across the country are selling a degree to their students that they would not recommend to people close to them,\u201d he wrote. Tamanaha predicted that structural changes meant that the legal market would never return to its pre-Recession levels. Unemployment for lawyers would be the new normal. The Vale of Tears catalogues the human toll of that trend.\nIt makes sense that there is so much weeping on this particular message board. These graduates face an average of $112,776 of student debt with no foreseeable prospect to repay. \u201cThe Vale gives people an opportunity to talk openly about sensitive personal and employment issues in a way you can\u2019t with classmates,\u201d Michael said.\nTop Law Schools was founded in 2003 by Ken DeLeon, a Silicon Valley attorney who transitioned to a successful career in real estate. He started the site to help applicants optimize their chances at getting into law school. Historically most TLS activity focused on the law school application process, with forums dedicated to studying for the LSAT and writing a personal statement.\nOther professions have similar online communities. Business school applicants have Poets & Quants, which produces a series called \u201cB-School Smackdowns.\u201d (Spoiler alert: Wharton beats Harvard.) Unlike TLS, however, the articles on Poets are more popular than the forums, making the site more akin to an industry publication like Above the Law. Accountants have Going Concern, but that is mostly read by practicing accountants rather than students. Perhaps the closest thing to TLS is Chemjobber for science professionals. The popular blogger challenges the assumption that STEM degrees are \u201csafe\u201d by revealing unexpectedly high unemployment rates. He also provides data on the prevalence of depression and anxiety to draw attention to STEM\u2019s mental health crisis.\nDespite common themes, Top Law Schools distinguishes itself from other sites with its unique blend of elitism and pessimism. Each year U.S. News & World Report releases its official law school rankings, and schools that are ranked 1-50 are widely considered to be Tier 1. But TLS promotes an even snobbier hierarchy: Yale through NYU are T6 (top six); followed by either T10, T14, T15, or T20 (the exact number is fiercely debated); then the rest of Tier 1 and Tier 2. Tier 3 and Tier 4 schools are collectively referred to as TTT (\u201cthird tier toilet\u201d).\nWhat fascinates me about Michael is that he\u2019s a TLS mega-poster where law school actually worked out. He landed a well-paying litigation job through his school\u2019s on-campus recruiting program. Many of his classmates struggled to find jobs, so he kept this news private in real life. He felt something like survivor\u2019s guilt.\nJohn has a very different story. He went to law school for the \u201cexistential reason\u201d of being interested in social justice issues. But he also had practical experience working in corporate HR, a soft that could give him an edge in a tough job market. During the application process, John read the TLS forums extensively. When he applied in 2010, he knew based on his GPA and LSAT exactly what schools would admit him and at what price. \u201cNo question that TLS gave me an advantage,\u201d he says.\nUnemployment for lawyers would be the new normal. The Vale of Tears catalogues the human toll of that trend.\nJohn estimates applying to 500 jobs before and after graduation. Out of this, he got four interviews; two were just courtesies. The only \u201cjob\u201d John landed was a volunteer position for a government agency. He lived in a former tenement in the South Side of Chicago and went on Medicaid for health insurance. Unable to make payments, his student loans quickly ballooned from $205,000 to $260,000. He scrambled to find doc review gigs for $19 to $22 hour. This meant reading thousands of spam emails and clicking on the ones that were not relevant to the pending lawsuit. He felt like a trained chimpanzee.\nJust a warning to all new applicants. This process takes a lot out of you mentally, puts you in a mountain of debt, and in the end, is nothing more than a giant pyramid scheme that allows silver-haired shysters running law schools to become millionaires with no accountability to what they are doing to students or to society [. . .] I've seen this scam wilt the life out of so many brilliant, young people, from the T6 on down. You should make sure you're not one of them.\nJohn resolved to put the TLS haters out of mind \u2014 just like his student debt. \u201cThe reality is if I don\u2019t make any money, they can\u2019t make me pay it.\u201d He stopped obsessively checking his balances.\nThe notion that TLS models real life recalls the argument that the internet actually is real life. Everyday people are asking these forums to decide their real life questions, publicly revealing highly personal stats to ask whether and where they should go to law school.\nMichael describes his contribution to TLS the way others speak about the value of volunteering. He joined TLS because he needed to connect with current law students and recent grads who knew how to succeed in the new economy. In recent years, he\u2019s been giving back to the site. I ask if he considers himself a \u201ccoach\u201d to applicants and students. More like \u201ceducator,\u201d he says.\nIf that\u2019s the case, John has work to do. When the legal employment crisis first attracted publicity, law school applications tanked. There were 38 percent fewer applicants in 2013 compared to 2010, contributing to a 30-year-low. But it appears law school applications are on the rise again with programs reporting a 12 percent increase between 2016 and 2017 even though the job market for lawyers has not significantly improved. Ten months after graduation, only about 63 percent of graduates find legal positions where bar passage is required, according to the American Bar Association. Many factors are likely at play, including the current political climate and a younger millennial cohort that was largely shielded from the recession. John continues to publish on TLS to reach this doe-eyed new audience.\nI wondered if Top Law Schools had become what creator Ken DeLeon intended. DeLeon told me he envisioned a supportive environment where people could \u201csynergistically help themselves through the forum and the community would give back to itself.\u201d Overall, TLS seems to be abiding by its founding principles. But its approach to giving back to the community has become very unorthodox: On TLS, paying it forward means telling others to think long and hard before they join.\nStephen Harrison is a lawyer and freelance writer.", "Mandalay Circle: A loud party was reported in the 16300 block at 10:43 p.m. Friday.

Her parents are Eric Roberts, an actor, and Kelly Cunningham but they divorced when she was young. Her aunt is the actress Julia Roberts who inspired her to embark on an acting career at the age of nine.\nActing Career: Emma Roberts' first acting role was in the 2001 drama 'Blow' opposite Johnny Depp. In 2002, she appeared opposite Jacob Fisher in 'Grand Champion' and the following year was in 'Spymate' alongside Chris Potter. In 2004, she became highly established among teenagers as singer/songwriter Addie Singer in Nickelodeon's 'Unfabulous' which ran until 2007. In 2006, she appeared with Sara Paxton and JoJo in 'Aquamarine' which was a box office success. That year she also finished filming 'Nancy Drew' in which she played the title role. In 2007, she was in 'Hotel for Dogs' which also starred Lisa Kudrow, Kevin Dillon and Don Cheadle. The following year she voiced Wilma in the animated movie 'The Flight Before Christmas'. In 2008, she starred in 'Wild Child' alongside Alex Pettyfer, Natasha Richardson, Shirley Henderson, Kimberley Nixon and Juno Temple. In 2010, she and her aunt Julia Roberts co-starred in 'Valentine's Day' and she also made appearances in 'Twelve' with Chace Crawford and Curtis Jackson, and 'It's Kind of a Funny Story' alongside Zach Galifianakis. In 2011, she was in the horror movie 'Scream 4' alongside David Arquette, Courteney Cox and Hayden Panettiere. In 2012, she starred as a popstar in 'Celeste and Jesse Forever' with Rashida Jones, Andy Samberg and Elijah Wood. Emma Roberts: Other career ventures Emma Roberts became brand ambassador for Neutrogena in 2009 and appeared in various advertisements.\nPersonal life: Emma Roberts dated her 'Wild Child' co-star Alex Pettyfer after meeting him on set. Between 2011 and 2012, she dated Chord Overstreet and she is currently dating actor Evan Peters. In 2011, she attended Sarah Lawrence College, though work commitments caused her to put it on hold.\nEmma Roberts is officially a cast member on the seventh season of FX's hit series 'American Horror Story', with the show this time round using the subtitle 'Cult'. Though no details surrounding her role have yet been revealed, the news came via a pair of social media posts by both showrunner Ryan Murphy and the actress herself.\nWith a premise that feels almost eerily current, this stylish thriller revolves around a phone app game that takes its users out into the streets, where they cause additional mayhem. The energetic cast and crew keep the story moving at a brisk pace, generating moments of comedy, emotion, romance and some genuinely breathless suspense along the way.\nIt's set in New York City, where creative teen Vee (Emma Roberts) lives with her single mother (Juliette Lewis) in Staten Island, frustrated that she can't afford to attend her chosen art college in Los Angeles. Her best pal Sydney (Emily Meade) has just started playing the gaming app Nerve, in which watchers goad players to take increasingly bold dares for cash prizes. Tired of being the quiet good girl, and clearly in need of money, Vee gives in and signs up to the game herself. Watchers then team her up with fellow player Ian (Dave Franco) for an escalating series of dangerous pranks around Manhattan. And as this outrageous night continues, suspicions grow that there's something sinister behind the game.\nDirectors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (Catfish) give the film a colourfully kinetic visual style, with acrobatic camerawork and a variety of social media imagery, from text graphics to video-streaming sequences. Rather than just noise, these elements pull the audience into the action, adding a first-person point of view that's involving and exciting. Jessica Sharzar's script doesn't dig beneath the surface, and her cautionary observations on gaming culture aren't terribly subtle, but there's a genuine sense of both fun and life-threatening chaos in each set-piece.\nFor their new thriller Nerve, Dave Franco and Emma Roberts play strangers thrown together by a gaming app as they take dares all around New York City. The lively combination of action, romance and edgy humour appealed to both actors.\nRoberts enjoyed the original approach of the script. \"I hadn't read anything like it,\" she says. \"I feel like people are always trying to incorporate social media into television and movies and it's so hard to do in a interesting way. But I saw this to be really relevant and captivating.\"\nAnd she couldn't imagine anyone else as her costar. \"I remember reading it and thinking the only person who could play the role of Ian was Dave Franco. They went out to him and I texted him, 'Please do this. You will love it. It will be so much fun!'\"\nEd Wallis has never really been the popular boy in his class and the thought of having to move to a brand new school and start over isn't exactly his idea of fun. Starting over in a new location with his mum, Ed soon becomes an easy target for the class jocks but he doesn't let it bother him. When he's given a new assignment from school to speak with and write an essay on an older person, Ed doesn't know where - or rather who - to turn to, that is until he sees his neighbour might and thinks he might be just the person to speak to.\nThough hesitant at the start, the neighbour agrees to speak with Ed. After the duo spend some time together, Ashby and Ed soon open up to one another and form an unlikely friendship. Ashby teaches Ed some much needed life lessons and vice versa.\nAshby was written and directed by Tony McNamara and had its premiere at this year's Tribeca Film Festival.

These heat-trapping gases are the byproduct of industrial processes such as refrigeration and can be eliminated from those processes by re-engineering. The amendment comes under the Montreal Protocol, the world\u2019s most successful international environmental treaty, which aims to stop the depletion of the ozone layer.\nHFCs are prime examples of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), a range of chemicals that are spewed into the atmosphere by human activities and contribute to global warming. While attempts to reduce climate change have rightly focused on the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, mostly produced from our use of fossil fuels, these other substances have been largely ignored.\nExperts estimate that cutting down on SLCPs could reduce global warming by as much as 0.5C. That would not be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change if we continue to burn fossil fuels, but it could buy humanity some much-needed time while carbon emissions are brought under better control.\nMany SLCPs break down relatively quickly in the atmosphere, unlike carbon dioxide, which can stick around for a century. But while they are present, they can have a greater impact: some HFCs have a global warming potential more than 11,000 times greater than that of carbon dioxide.\nThe Kigali amendment, by avoiding the equivalent of up to 90bn tonnes of CO2 by 2050, could be \u201cperhaps the single most significant contribution to keeping warming well below 2C, aiming for the still safer 1.5C,\u201d Zaelke told the Guardian.\nAnother SLCP is methane, produced when vegetation rots and from animals, and in the form of natural gas from fossil fuel exploration. Methane is more than 20 times as powerful as carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, but few attempts are made to stop it reaching the atmosphere, even from easily containable sources such as sewage plants and intensive livestock farms, and from industrial sources such as fracking wells and oil and gas production.\nSoot, or black carbon, is another byproduct of burning fossil fuels, and its effects can clearly be seen at the poles, particularly the Arctic. Brown, black and grey stains over the pristine wildernesses of Greenland, Siberia and Alaska come not from natural sources but from the fall of soot from the air, carried thousands of miles from fossil fuel burning. The stains contribute to warming, because the darkened snow absorbs more heat instead of reflecting it.\nSoot from power station chimneys and vehicle tailpipes can be captured at source or reduced by switching to burning cleaner fuels. But getting rid of soot helps combat not just warming but also air pollution, as the particles are one of the leading causes of ill-health from environmental factors.\nCutting down on soot is not straightforward, however. The contribution of aerosols such as soot and other small particles to warming is complex: while soot on Earth blackens snow and other surfaces and increases warming, aerosols high in the atmosphere deflect some of the sun\u2019s rays back into space. This dimming effect could have already saved the world from as much as 0.5C warming that might have been expected from the quantities of carbon now in the air, according to Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, chief scientist at Conservation International.\nRemoving soot or stopping its release into the air might end up being of less use to the climate than stopping other SLCPs as a result, but it would save lives blighted by air pollution.", "Bomb threat found in bathroom at Cedarburg H.S.\nCEDARBURG -- Police are investigating a bomb threat that was written on a bathroom stall inside Cedarburg High School Tuesday afternoon.

Cedarburg school officials say if parents choose to keep students home from school Thursday, the absence will not count against the student.\nThe bathroom where the threat was found Tuesday was immediately locked and the Cedarburg Police Department was contacted. At the time, the school was searched and found to be safe for class. On Wednesday morning, multiple students were questioned about the situation, but so far, police say they have nobody in custody in connection with the threat.\nThe school was searched again Wednesday afternoon by Cedarburg police and school administration. It will be searched one more time Thursday morning before classes, and Cedarburg Principal Jeff Nelson says two police officers will be on campus Thursday morning. \"Both the Cedarburg Police Department and our school administration are confident that our school will be safe Thursday, but in an attempt to be sensitive to parents' concerns for the well-being of their children, the absence will not negatively affect that student's attendance status,\" Nelson said in the letter Wednesday.\nCLICK HERE to read the letter from Cedarburg Principal Jeff Nelson to parents.\nAnyone with information relative to the threat is encouraged to talk to an administrator or any other school personnel.

The Tigers managed 12 rushing yards during the entirety of their 29-0 loss. That number was less than zero well into the second half.\nMississippi State now has to face an Alabama defensive front that is finding its stride during the stretch run of the season. The Bulldogs might be finding their own footing on the side of the ball that has to line up against that vaunted Tide defense.\nOffensive coordinator Luke Getsy said the MSU offense has really come together during this mini two-game winning streak.

Getsy said all of those aspects must continue to be executed at a high level for Mississippi State to see any semblance of success against the top team in the country.\nThrough the air, Getsy said the difference in the last two weeks compared to the struggles of weeks prior has been the cohesiveness between Fitzgerald and his receivers.\nAfter a 19-3 loss to LSU in which the Dogs only had 59 passing yards, junior wide receiver Deddrick Thomas said he didn\u2019t think everyone on the offense was on the same page.\nThe Bulldogs fixed that with a 28-13 win over Texas A&M when Fitzgerald threw for 243 yards, and then they backed it up last week in a 45-3 victory over Louisiana Tech. Fitzgerald tallied 241 yards through the air, and Thomas had 70 of them.\nImproving upon that success against Alabama is a lot to ask of an offense that looked completely broken as recently as three weeks ago. It has been imperative for State to figure it out before traveling to Tuscaloosa.\nNow that the Bulldogs have improved, the question now is whether or not the Dogs can maintain the offensive inertia they've built. Sustaining drives will be a big part of sustaining the overall functionality of the offense. Getsy said the feel of the LSU game would have been different had MSU scored a touchdown instead of kicking a field goal on its second drive of the game.\nMississippi State kicked that field goal in an in-goal situation early in the first quarter and then didn\u2019t score the rest of the game. Teams don\u2019t win road games in the SEC West by kicking field goals in situations in which touchdowns should have been scored.\nGetsy knows that, so the goal this week is to take advantage of every opportunity. Mississippi State simply doesn\u2019t know how many good ones it will get against the No. 1 Tide.", "Among the Americans in Baghdad, there is back-stabbing and miscommunication -- people on the same side working at cross purposes and sometimes in direct conflict. Miller experiences this in a series of encounters with a Special Forces hotshot played by Jason Isaacs, who has a habit of showing up to undermine whatever Miller is doing, sometimes punching him in the face for good measure.\nFor the Iraqis things are much worse, and \"Green Zone\" is admirable in its refusal to make them bit players in their own nation's drama even though the Americans occupy center stage. A Baathist general named Al Rawi (Igal Naor) lurks in the shadows, either a potential asset in the American effort to reconstruct the country or a dangerous obstacle. At Miller's side is a man he calls Freddy (Khalid Abdalla), who serves as an informant and a translator and who expresses the deep ambivalence -- the hope, the disappointment, the anger -- of ordinary Iraqis who suffered under Hussein's dictatorship and are not sure how much to trust their liberators.\n\"It is not you who will decide what happens here,\" Freddy says to Miller, in one of the film's forgivably pointed lines. I say forgivably because \"Green Zone\" seems to epitomize the ability of mainstream commercial cinema to streamline the complexities of the real world without becoming overly simplistic, to fictionalize without falsifying. Pedants may object that the chase sequences and plot twists distort the facts, while thrill-seekers may complain that the politics get in the way of the explosions and firefights. And the inevitable huffing and puffing about this movie's supposedly left-wing or \"anti-American\" agenda has already begun.\nAll of this suggests that the arguments embedded within the movie's version of 2003 are still going on seven years later, and are still in need of accessible and honest airing. Which is precisely what \"Green Zone,\" without forsaking its job of entertainment, attempts. When Mr. Greengrass made \"United 93,\" his 2006 reconstruction of one of the Sept. 11 hijackings, some people fretted that it was too soon. My own response to \"Green Zone\" is almost exactly the opposite: it's about time.\nI wish I could see this in the theater, but I think I'm going to have to wait on Netflix. I do love Damon and Amy Ryan, though.", "JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s struggling state-run power firm Eskom said on Monday it was considering cutting staff and selling assets after reporting a $171 million loss which underlined the gravity of its financial position.\nEskom, Africa\u2019s largest public utility, was embroiled in corruption scandals under former president Jacob Zuma and narrowly avoided a liquidity crunch early this year after banks halted lending. Zuma has denied wrongdoing.\nThe company is critical to South Africa. It supplies more than 90 percent of the country\u2019s power, has around 270 billion rand ($20 billion) of state-guaranteed debt and is often cited as a threat to South Africa\u2019s credit ratings, which hover on the edge of junk status.\nCash-strapped Eskom has also become one of the most visible examples of the effects of corruption at state-run companies in South Africa, as a pay dispute with unions triggered protests leading to a spate of rolling blackouts last month.\nNew President Cyril Ramaphosa replaced Eskom\u2019s entire board and top executives in January, in one of his first interventions since becoming leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC).\nEskom blamed the 2.3 billion rand loss for the financial year which ended in March on increases in financing costs and depreciation of assets like Kusile and Medupi, two massive coal-fired power stations which have suffered significant delays and cost overruns.\nIt also reported 19.6 billion rand of irregular expenditure and said it had 15.8 billion rand of cash at the end of March, down from 20.4 billion a year earlier.\nEskom\u2019s new management is combing its finances from late 2012 in an effort to recover money lost through corruption. It has asked for criminal cases to be opened against some former employees and suppliers.\nChief Executive Phakamani Hadebe said Eskom had started discussions with the government about getting its staff numbers right, a veiled reference that the firm is considering cuts to its bloated 47,000 workforce.\nAnalysts have long called for Eskom to take action to reduce ballooning staff costs, and Eskom Chairman Mabuza said on Monday the company believed it had around one-third too many employees.\nEskom executives also said they were looking at whether to sell non-core assets to shore up the firm\u2019s balance sheet.\nANC sources told Reuters this month that Ramaphosa had secured the backing of senior figures in the ruling party for steps to boost private investment in the power supply industry, including by selling off non-essential parts of Eskom\u2019s business.\nEskom has already announced plans to sell a mortgage lender it owns.\n\u201cWe are busy with the process of optimising our balance sheet,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Calib Cassim said, warning that high financing costs would continue to drag on Eskom\u2019s bottom line in the 2018/19 financial year.", "New medical facility opens in Lewis Center.\nBeginning at 8 a.m. Wednesday, Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital and OhioHealth began offering separate 24/7 full-service emergency departments under one roof in Lewis Center.\nAlso, a wide range of outpatient services are also available at the facility located at 7853 Pacer Drive, just north of Orange Road, a news release states.\nIt\u2019s important for parents to understand when to seek appropriate health care for their child.

Find out what it will have to offer.\nTHE latest project from The Block\u2019s most successful contestants to date, Alisa and Lysandra Fraser, is set to hit the market this spring.\nThe twins have revealed they\u2019ve been hard at work renovating a Victorian terrace in Albert Park over the past 18 months, since they purchased it off-market for $2.15 million.\nLysandra told Property Insiders they planned to list the finished product in September or October.\nShe said it was the first project they\u2019d taken on themselves, rather than for a client, since launching business Alisa and Lysandra Interiors after appearing on the Channel 9 reno show\u2019s 2013 and 2014 seasons.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had each other to contend with. But we\u2019ve had free rein,\u201d Lysandra said.\nThe former cops were drawn to the single-fronted terrace\u2019s closeness to the beach and period features including high ceilings.\nThe fact its 200sqm block had access and space for off-street parking at the rear was also \u201ca real drawcard for Albert Park\u201d.\nThe sisters\u2019 reno has involved restoring the home\u2019s brick facade, front rooms and hallway, and adding a modern three-level extension at the back.\nTo achieve the latter, the pair dug out a 3m-deep and 16m-long basement and cellar level.\n\u2018That\u2019s going to be the big surprise,\u201d Lysandra said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that probably hasn\u2019t been done in this type of property before, because not many people would be gutsy enough.\nThree bedrooms, three bathrooms, two living areas, a cinema room and two terraces will complete the pad.\nThe Adelaide-based twins have worked for several clients in the Albert Park area \u2014 including a fan of the show who hired them to fit out his three-bedroom Victorian at 102 Graham St before selling it for $2.155 million last April.\nThe Block apartment that won them $616,000 in prize money on 2014\u2019s Fans vs. Faves season is also in the suburb.\nThis, combined with their $395,000 earnings from winning 2013\u2019s Sky High series, makes the Frasers the show\u2019s highest earning contestants.\nTheir latest project has been filmed for an eight-part series, set for release on their website in September.", "Would A Pill To Protect Teens From HIV Make Them Feel Invincible? : Shots - Health News Trials are underway to see how effective a pill approved for HIV prevention in adults may be for teenagers. But some worry Truvada could end up encouraging reckless sexual behavior among young people.\nTruvada can dramatically reduce the risk of HIV infection when taken as a preventative medicine \u2014 if taken every day. Studies are underway to determine if young people are likely to take the pill consistently.\nLeon Richardson is 18 years old and tall, charismatic and thoughtful about his sexual health.\nHe understands that as a young, gay black man, he is in the demographic with the highest rate of HIV infections in the country. But when Richardson learned that he could be part of an HIV prevention pill research study for young people, he was skeptical.\n\"I was scared. I had to really think about it, 'What is this drug going to do to me?' \" he says.\nThe regimen, called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, can reduce the risk of HIV infection by more than 85 percent when a pill called Truvada is taken daily. In a first, the Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada for prevention of the infection in 2012. Truvada had been used previously to treat HIV infection.\nBut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends caution when prescribing PrEP to adolescents. CDC is waiting for final results from the trials being conducted on young people in cities across the country.\nInitially, Richardson's mom stoked his concerns. \"She was saying the medical industry tried to sterilize some people; they were trying to do it again,\" he remembers. But he found encouragement from another family member: his grandfather, who is HIV-positive.\n\"We had a long discussion about this drug and what the side effects could be, and he overall supported me totally,\" Richardson says. \"And it was kinda like, why not? Let me just try it.\"\nNow, Richardson is part of CRUSH, an HIV-prevention project in Oakland, Calif. CRUSH offers PrEP to participants.\nDaniel Zeh is part of a PrEP study being conducted by the Adolescent Trials Network with young people between the ages of 15 and 22, based at John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital in Chicago. He was 17 when he started taking the pill as part of a daily regimen that was sometimes hard to explain, he says.\n\"I guess it was kind of weird during high school, popping it before lunch, trying to make sure nobody sees,\" Zeh chuckles. \"People are like, 'What are you taking?' 'Nothing, you know, just a sugar pill.' \"\nZeh first heard about the Stroger Hospital study on Facebook. Outreach coordinators also turned to gay hook-up apps, like Grindr and Jack'd, to recruit possible subjects. It's a clever strategy, even if it's awkward to run into a researcher when you're looking for a date.\nPsychologist Sybil Hosek, the lead researcher for the study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, offered to pay participants $50 per visit to the clinic. When enough guys said yes, she got to work.\n\"What we wanted to do was design a study where they could try to take this pill every day,\" Hosek explains. \"And see whether, one, they were interested in taking it; two, if it was hard for them to take it; and three, how it impacted their sexual behavior.\" For instance, would being on the pill encourage more risky sexual activity?\nInside a conference room at the hospital, a group of the guys in the study share stories about what it's like to be on PrEP. Dexter Canty is also enrolled in the Chicago PrEP study, and says people have a lot of misunderstandings about the pill and individuals who take it. They're often asked, \"Are you HIV positive?\" But, in fact, they're taking the drug to prevent getting infected.\nCanty compares the reactions he's experienced to people's perceptions when he goes to the drugstore to buy condoms or when a woman goes to Planned Parenthood and gets birth control. \"You're automatically looked at as being promiscuous instead of safe,\" he says.\nThe idea is that PrEP would be used in combination with condoms. But critics worry that the pill will make users feel invincible, increasing the likelihood that they won't use condoms or follow through on taking the pill every day. And when you miss doses, the pill becomes less effective.\nAndrew Weinstein, President of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, is against PrEP use, especially by young people. \"Young people have unstable lives. They're sleeping on someone's couch. They're out for the weekend,\" he says. \"That's not to stigmatize them, it's just the nature of youth. It's a carefree time. Expecting people to take a pill every day is not realistic,\" says Weinstein.\nIt's enticing to imagine a magic pill that could bring about the end of AIDS. But a recent study of young adults taking PrEP shows that they take it, at best, 60 percent of the time.", "Thor could get go-ahead if finger injury heals enough for Subway Series finale.\nAfter throwing 25 pitches in a simulated game Tuesday afternoon at Citi Field, Syndergaard is lined up for the Mets\u2019 series finale against the Yankees, as long as he and his strained right index finger continue to feel fine until then.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Syndergaard will be in a special pitch count. He last played May 25 \u2014 more than two weeks before his anticipated Sunday start \u2014 when he stopped at 78 pitches against Milwaukee. He did not stretch out Tuesday, throwing one simulated inning against Yoenis Cespedes, Jose Lobaton and Luis Guillorme.\nJacob deGrom is scheduled to face the Yankees on Friday, with Steven Matz going Saturday.\nOf Syndergaard\u2019s 25 pitches, Cespedes saw 15 of them, the first time he faced live pitching as he rehabs his strained right hip flexor.\nManager Mickey Callaway said Cespedes is scheduled to run the bases and do fielding drills Wednesday.\n\u201cSome more position-specific exercises and kind of running through \u2014 kind of a test per se \u2014 and go from there,\u201d Callaway said.\nThe Mets have said they are considering bringing Cespedes back without a minor-league rehab assignment, though they will see how he feels.\nCespedes declined to comment. He has not discussed his injury since May 6, a week and a half before he went on the disabled list.\nThe Mets took college players with all eight of their choices on day two of the MLB draft (rounds 3-10) Tuesday, including ambidextrous second baseman Carlos Cortes from the University of South Carolina in the third round. In the infield, he throws righthanded. In the outfield, lefthanded.\nHalf of the Mets\u2019 picks were pitchers 6-foot-5 or taller. \u201cI think an NFL scout got in here and started drafting for us,\u201d said Tommy Tanous, vice president of international and amateur scouting.\nMets second-rounder Simeon Woods-Richardson, a pitcher from outside Houston selected Monday night, said he was surprised to get picked when he did, having expected to go on day two.

A congressional vote is expected later this week.\nBut that tweet order was even more remarkable because it also represented an astonishing break from what congressional lawmakers \u2013 whose actions on the floor of the House of Representatives and Senate hew to centuries-old traditions \u2013 call \u201cregular order,\u201d two ordinary words with extraordinary power in the American capital. Among the many hoary traditions of Washington that are under siege in the Trump era is a fundamental one: Presidents don\u2019t order legislators around.\nMr. Trump has already challenged, and then upended, much of the regular order in Washington. But what is emerging in recent weeks is that the President is increasingly acting more like a prime minister than a president, and the GOP is in danger of becoming the Trump Party.\nThus Mr. Trump, who has sparred with unusual bitterness with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, may actually covet the political birthrights the prime minister possesses.\nEven the strongest of presidents defer to the prerogatives of Congress, and often they require at least some support from the rival party; the landmark civil-rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, promoted by president Lyndon Johnson, himself a former titan of Capitol Hill, required both Republican and Democratic support. And even in that case, Mr. Johnson, a former Senate majority leader, did not issue orders to his former congressional colleagues. He romanced and cajoled them, but privately and with traditional presidential deference to Congress. The separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches are the bedrock of the American political system.\nMr. Trump\u2019s inclination to issue directives and to disrupt the regular order \u2013 first emerging when he not only called the tune, but also set the key signature for the effort to repeal Obamacare \u2013 may be the result of the President\u2019s management style, forged in business. American chief executives expect loyalty and fealty, and particularly in real estate, top firms take on the character of a single deal-maker.\nOr it may be a result of the failure, or disinclination, of Republican leaders to veer from Mr. Trump\u2019s wishes, given his huge popularity among party members (87 per cent on the 500th day of his presidency earlier this month, though dropping as a result of the migrant children episode).\nU.S. presidents have often regarded the Canadian and British systems with envy, believing prime ministers have more power than presidents and that parliamentary ministries operate with greater efficiency, and with more centralized control, than American departments and agencies.\nAnd so, when presidents seek to assume the roles prime ministers play in Canada and Britain, they often speak of \u201ccabinet government,\u201d efforts evident in the administrations of the Republican Richard Nixon (1969-1974) and the Democrat Jimmy Carter (1977-1981).\nIndeed, Mr. Nixon sat as chairman in 21 of the first 23 urban affairs cabinet groups in his first 18 months, but soon grew tired of the exercise. Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to assume the role of a prime minister is of a different character, plunging him into the legislative arena in a way that presidents, many of whom have congressional experience or are surrounded by aides with Capitol Hill experience, studiously avoid.\nThen again, congressional leaders in the past guarded their prerogatives more jealously than do Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Majority Leader, and Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House. Both are more inclined to march to the presidential tune than their predecessors, who were vigilant in defence of the separation of powers.\n\u201dIt was the separation of powers upon which the framers placed their hopes for the preservation of the people\u2019s liberties,\u201d said the late Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who as Senate majority leader during the entire Carter administration taunted his fellow Democrats in the White House with his vigilance on the separation of powers.\nThere are, to be sure, dangers in Mr. Trump\u2019s approach, as British Prime Minister Theresa May, who leads a minority government and who faces rebellions from her own party over Brexit, could ruefully explain to the President.\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this article misspelled British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s name and incorrectly said she leads a small majority government. This version has been corrected.", "Calls for law enforcement reform have proliferated since the death of Michael Brown on Aug. 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, along with other subsequent allegations of police brutality.\nThe symposium will begin at 9 a.m. in the Bedsole Moot Courtroom of the law school and will end at 4:30 p.m. The event is free and open to the public.\nThe symposium will feature speakers with legal and law enforcement backgrounds who will offer their expertise on issues related to civil rights, reform and other related topics.

Arnold Schwarzenegger last year put on hold plans to spray 12 counties, most of them in the Bay Area, until safety tests were done.\nOne of the products tested was Hercon's Disrupt Bio-Flake, which the EPA registered in January as a pheromone pesticide that interferes with mating of the moth.\nTests on animals for acute effects, but not chronic effects, showed no immediate problems. The pesticide is made with an active pheromone and three undisclosed other ingredients. Hercon must apply for registration in California and undergo an evaluation that could take months.\nStephan Volker, an Oakland attorney representing the residents in last year's suit against the EPA, said residents want to know all of the ingredients in any product.\nWhile the EPA contends that federal pesticide laws allow the manufacturers to keep the inert ingredients secret, Volker said \"the law allows EPA to disclose the ingredients where necessary to protect public health.\"", "Brine-time: You know all those small-scale picklers are dying to get together and talk shop.\nBurlesque we can: Think about your favorite burlesque performacne.

A recent report from a Niko Partners analyst estimates that the series generated $700 million in revenue from September 2015 to September 2016, an especially impressive performance given that the last version of Grand Theft Auto V launched in April of last year.\nEven more impressive, the game did more sales in its third year than its second, and probably at higher margins thanks to greater contribution from downloadable content purchases. This type of staying power is virtually unheard of in video games, and the series' successful formula looks to generate ongoing advantages for Take-Two, some of which might also extend to the company's recently announced Red Dead Redemption 2.\nWhile the biggest software releases from video game rivals Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) are built around annual release models, Take-Two has taken a more staggered approach to Grand Theft Auto releases that has helped preserve the series' relevance and stave off franchise decline. The company's massive development investments in its core property have helped keep quality sky-high, and this has translated into sustained sales and an ongoing strengthening of the GTA brand.\nAs of the end of October, Grand Theft Auto V had shipped more than 70 million copies, and the game's nearly unmatched sales life is still not close to being finished. In fact, with the exception of Nintendo franchises including Pokemon and Mario, no other gaming property has managed to remain at the forefront of industry popularity to the same extent as Grand Theft Auto \u2013 and moving away from more regular releases looks to be making the franchise more profitable.\nThe series launched in 1997, but its blockbuster success really kicked off with the release of Grand Theft Auto III in 2001. Grand Theft Auto IV came out in 2008, followed by the release of the series' most recent mainline installment in 2013. Before Grand Theft Auto V, Take-Two followed up mainline series releases with semi-sequels and paid downloadable content expansions that focused on adding new single-player experiences, but the company now appears focused on releasing one big series installment every four to five years and continuing to generate revenue through evolving online modes.\nIn April, a lawsuit filed against Take-Two revealed that Grand Theft Auto: Online had generated at least $500 million in digital revenue, and with strong continued engagement and the addition of new features, it's likely that this sum has climbed substantially higher.\nThe 2016 fiscal year saw Take-Two achieve record digital content revenue of $698 million -- representing 55% year-over-year growth from 2015. Much of this momentum came from the ongoing success of GTA: Online. Compared with the expenses needed to develop a major series update, the dramatically lower cost of producing virtual goods and new game modes and scenarios to keep players involved means that Take-Two is generating massively improved sales margins. Despite development and marketing costs north of $265 million, GTA V will probably wind up as the most profitable entry in series history.\nIn an industry climate that has increasingly come to revolve around annualized releases, GTA: Online is keeping the series fresh and relevant and bolstering Take-Two's performance in the years between major releases in its most important franchise. This successful model is also being applied to some of the company's other big franchises, including the upcoming Red Dead Redemption 2. The continued digital-content push looks to unlock earnings potential in the years to come.\nThe Red Dead and GTA series have significant gameplay elements in common, and early indications suggest that Red Dead Redemption 2 will include an online mode that's similar to GTA: Online. While the Read Dead series has a much smaller player base than GTA, it's still big in its own right. The series' last installment shipped over 14 million copies, and a successful mirroring of the high-quality experience and persistent online gameplay component seen with GTA V would probably create another sustained earner for Take-Two.\nWith GTA V still moving copies at an impressive clip and driving high-margin in-game purchases, Red Dead Redemption 2 set to receive a similarly styled online mode, and a mainline GTA sequel a fair bet to arrive as a huge success in 2018, Take-Two investors can look forward to strong earnings drivers on the horizon.", "New Delhi: Jet Airways\u2019 unlisted subsidiary, low-cost airline JetLite, had incurred a loss after tax of \u20b9 273 crore for the second quarter ended 30 September, which made the accumulated losses of the erstwhile Sahara Airlines exceed its net worth.\nWhile declaring its results of the second quarter ended 30 September, Jet Airways had said the subsidiary had \u201caccumulated losses exceeding its net worth and its financial statements have been prepared on going concern basis\".\nAccording to reliable sources, JetLite\u2019s revenues for the said quarter were at Rs429.3 crore against Rs366.2 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.\nJetlite\u2019s loss after tax increased over three-fold for the second quarter to Rs273 crore from Rs86.27 crore in the year-ago period.\nJet Airways had also said in October that the parent company planned to support the growth plans of the said subsidiary based on its assets, growth model and other factors.\nDuring the quarter under review, Jetlite had a seat factor of 61.2% against 68% in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.\nThe carrier\u2019s revenue per passenger kilometre increased to Rs4.3 in Q2 in FY\u201909 versus Rs3.6 in Q2 FY\u201908.\nWhen contacted, a company spokesperson said: \u201cThere was no specific reason for losses but the general downturn in the industry\".\nThe operations of Jet Airways as a whole showed a pre-tax loss of Rs578.5 crore versus a profit of Rs42.5 crore which was achieved in the same period last year.\nThe breakdown of this number shows a loss of \u20b9 88.6 crore on the domestic operations and a loss of \u20b9 289.9 crore on the international operations.\nThe net loss suffered by Jet Airways stood at Rs384.5 crore with total income of Rs3,121.34 for the second quarter.", "PESHAWAR: The leaders of various political parties have condemned the killing of people by police in Sahiwal and demanded judicial probe into the incident.\nQaumi Watan Party (QWP) chairman Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao in a statement here on Monday asked the government to probe the incidents occurred in Sahiwal, Punjab and Khaisor village in North Waziristan and provide justice to the affected families.\nHe said the sanctity of veil and shelter was violated in Khaisor village. He said that it was not the first case of its kind as similar incidents had taken place in the past. He said that it would create distrust among the people. about the state institutions.\nMr Sherpao showed sympathy with the relatives of the people, who were killed in an alleged encounter by Counter-Terrorism Department in Sahiwal. He said that the officials involved in the incident should be awarded exemplary punishment.\nThe QWP leader said that the Sahiwal incident created unrest among the people and raised questions about the ability of the law-enforcers.\nHe criticised the Punjab law minister for terming the killing in Sahiwal as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d, saying it was tantamount to rubbing salt into the wounds of the affected family.\nPPP women wing provincial president MPA Nighat Orakzai also condemned the incident, saying she had submitted a resolution to the provincial assembly secretariat to condemn the tragic incident.\n\u201cI want the assembly to approve the resolution so that exemplary punishment could be awarded to the personnel of CTD for taking lives of innocent people without any reason,\u201d she said.\nThe MPA urged the government to ensure provision of proper medical and psychological care to the children, who survived the gory incident. \u201cI want the government to ensure provision of all facilities to the children including quality education so that they could become sensible citizens of the country,\u201d she added.\nSimilarly, PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam also described the incident as total failure of the government. He demanded judicial probe into the matter to teach a lesson to the people involved in the heinous crime.\nIn a statement, he said that PTI leadership always claimed to have brought reforms in police but the incident showed the reality of the hollow claims. He said that government should admit failure and take legal action against the concerned officials otherwise such incidents would force people to take to the streets across the country.", "A new law takes effect July 1 in California which makes it more expensive for homeowners to install or replace garage door openers.\nThe new law, signed last September, requires newly sold or installed garage door openers in residential applications to have a battery backup. The law was enacted in the wake of a series of deadly fires in the state.\nAccording to the California Real Estate Inspection Association, the loss of electricity in neighborhoods affected by the fast-spreading fires made it difficult for some people to escape. In some cases, residents were not able to flee in their vehicles, which were behind closed doors in a garage.\nAt least 44 deaths and 192 severe injuries were attributed to the series of wildfires that burned nearly a quarter of a million acres in 2017. There were even more serious fires the following year.\nGarage door openers have a manual release, disengaging it from the powertrain. However, the Association says there were reports of neighbors stopping to help raise garage doors for elderly people who didn't have the strength to manually open their garage door, and a mother who struggled to get her disabled son into a car because their custom van was in the garage they couldn't open.\nIn the end, the fact that the garage door could not be easily opened was blamed for some of the wildfire deaths.\nThe new law will require homeowners who install an automatic garage door opener that is \u201cmanufactured for sale, sold, offered for sale, or installed in a residence\u201d to have a battery backup system that can operate the door in the event of an electricity outage.\nFailing to comply with the law would result in a $1,000 fine.\nLast year, the California legislature passed a law requiring new homes built in the state to be equipped with solar panels. The California Energy Commission estimated that the move would drive up housing costs by $10,000, but it said that the decision will eventually save consumers in the form of reduced energy bills.\nBuilders had initially criticized the measure but were reportedly on board with the final rules after regulators agreed on Wednesday to a series of exemptions -- including one for houses with roofs too small to support solar installations.\nThat new law takes effect in January.", "If you don't already have tickets for tomorrow's Diamondbacks/Dodgers game, you're out of the luck.

It helps build a brand, drives traffic and awareness and builds out communities.\nBut, what we've also seen is social media bringing together people to lend their time to important causes on a global level. By using the sites we LIVE on every day (don't tell me you haven't realized you've been spending about 30% of your day tweeting)\u2014why not use all of these friends and followers to do something good?\nWhile many people have ideas to start a charitable program or event, actually doing something isn't as easy. There is planning, event scouting, logistics, food, drink\u2014-you name it, it's tough. Typically, this process can take weeks or months to come together. But, with the help from online communities this process can become even easier, and the results can be nearly instantaneous.\nLooking for motivation to start your own charity event using social media? We\u2019ve put together a list of recent events that have used the success of past events and others to springboard their efforts.\nOn 12 February 2009, 202 cities around the world held Twestivals, bringing together the Twitter community for an evening of fun and to raise money and awareness for charity: water. The total raised from the Global Twestival stands at $250,000 USD with numbers continuing to roll in. By organizing an event globally using Twitter as a driving force with additional information on Vimeo videos and Facebook pages, the event was able to provide clean water for over 17,000 people.\nTwestival's success lies in its scale to change the world in a mass way on one single night, and by appealing to people to get together in person for the cause. To organize like this event, start with the basics and use the power of the tweet to spread the news.\nTweetsgiving was a project of Epic Change that sought to demonstrate the power of Twitter and the social web by raising $10,000 in 48 hours to build a classroom at a school in Tanzania. The project was inspired by the TrickorTweet campaign organized around Halloween by @TheGrok and @ChrisBrogan. By using social media including blog posts and Twitter, the online event spread virally within a short amount of time to bring together those interested in contributing to a good cause.\nTweetsgiving worked best because it was able to appeal to donors' sense of holiday and giving within a short window of time, which drove a viral effect.\nHosted by Joel Comm and Dan Nickerson, The Twitter Power Tweet-a-Thon was a 12 hour charity event on February 12th that played out concurrently in two social media venues; a live video broadcast on Ustream.tv and on Twitter itself, to raise money and awareness for Water is Life.\nTweetathon represented a low barrier to entry for users - all they had to do was watch. And many donors, who were typically comfortable with the concept of \"online communities\" didn't see the online nature of this as an impediment, rather, it was a way to unify people all around the world from their computer screens.\nLaura Fitton, or @Pistachio as she is popularly known on Twitter, had one goal this past holiday season: To save kids' lives. Not wanting to ask for too much in a time tough for everyone, she realized that if every one of her followers donated only $2 she could raise $25,000 and donate it to Charity: Water and build an entire water project for a school or hospital in Africa. The Well Wishes campaign has ultimately raised nearly $20,000 and is still going strong.\nThis was a Twitter only project, and worked because of Laura's goodwill, and the novelty and ease of use of Tipjoy's donation system. This proves also how simple tools that have been created to HELP social media spread can also help a good cause.\nCritical Mass VP and well-regarded usability and branding expert David Armano sent a personal appeal to his readers to help a woman affected by domestic abuse, to find an apartment for her and her family. Within a matter of days, mostly in small amounts, his network came together to raise nearly $17,000, which went directly to help her.\nDavid's appeal worked because it was authentic, honest and true, but also because people could immediately identify with the cause. By creating a relationship with a network, you can interact and provide value to the cause and give it a personal touch.\nThese events illustrate the power that a small group of individuals and their networks can have to instantly and effectively change the world for the better, whether it be on a worldwide scale or to benefit one single individual in need. Knowing your audience, targeting marketing, appealing to the greater good, great timing, and a clear call-to-response help, but personal networks, trust and transparency have started to usurp years of tried and true offline fundraising techniques - and with more immediate impact. The art of fundraising is changing, and social media, like with so many other things, is helping to change the rules.\nThis post was co-authored by Gradon Tripp and Matthew Knell, co-organizers of Social Media for Social Change, host of The SM4SC NYC event on Friday, April 3rd. The fundraiser will combine live entertainment, invaluable networking, and fundraising into a single night of fun to benefit City Harvest, the world\u2019s first \u2014 and New York\u2019s only \u2014 food rescue program.

We want a simple explanation and if we just say they\u2019re mentally ill, case closed. Because of how fearful dangerous and deadly their actions are, we really want to distance ourselves from it and relegate it to illness.\"\nDespite this, gun violence is an open question that is now dogging Washington, as politicians discuss how to resolve a seemingly unending number of mass shootings. And now Republicans have primarily framed the issue as a mental health crisis.\nBroward County Mayor Beam Furr told NPR that Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz had shown signs of mental illness \u2014 as many mass shooters have \u2014 and \"had been a client at some mental health facilities.\"\nIn response to the shooting, President Donald Trump said he would help the nation with \"the difficult issue of mental health.\"\nThe claim appeared at odds with his administration's 2019 budget proposal that included a 22.5 percent cut to Medicaid, which accounted for a quarter of 2014's mental health spending nationwide, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nOn Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that he intends to have the Department of Justice work with other federal agencies \"to study the intersection of mental health and criminality and violence and identify how we can stop people before these heinous crimes occur.\"\nTrump previously pushed that same perspective after the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, stating \"mental health is your problem here\" and calling the shooter \"a very deranged individual.\"\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan Thursday touched on the issue of gun control when he said mentally ill individuals might be \"slipping through the cracks and getting guns.\"\nBut Fox remains skeptical that a greater emphasis on mental health and background checks will bring about change.\n\"Most mass murderers don\u2019t have criminal records or mental health treatment,\" said Fox. \"The reason we should have [background checks] occurs every day in America. We have an average of 40 shooting homicides a day. That\u2019s the reason, not the occasional mass shooting.\"\nExperts say that the public has to be careful with how it thinks about gun violence and mental illness, otherwise it could stigmatize those who suffer from mental health issues.\nAnd considering that suicide by firearm killed 313,641 people between 1999 and 2015, according to the National Center for Injury Prevention, it appears much more likely that the mentally ill will hurt themselves than others.\nDr. Jonathan Metzl, director of the Center for Medicine, Health and Society at Vanderbilt University, said that these mass shootings highlight Americans' desire to reaffirm a stigmatization of the mentally ill as \"ticking time bombs\" to avoid more difficult conversations about gun violence.\n\"Mass shootings are horrific and terrifying,\" he said. \"But if we really want to stop gun violence in this country, everyday gun violence is predictable and could be stopped. Ending everyday gun violence would help end mass shootings as well.\"\nAccording to Everytown for Gun Safety, 34 percent of the mass shootings that occurred between Jan. 2009 and Dec. 2016 were committed by those considered to be \"prohibited possessors\" \u2014 or people who are unable to purchase guns because of their age, criminal conviction(s), history of addiction, a domestic abuse conviction or a person who has been \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" or been admitted to a mental institution.\nAccording to a 2016 report published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), just ensuring weapons don't enter the hands of the mentally ill isn't enough to prevent mass shootings from occurring regularly. Instead, the report suggests that public health and education campaigns are needed to teach people how to report concerning behavior to authorities and how to learn coping skills for anger and conflict resolution.\nThe report also proposes that policies and laws be focused on dangerous behavior that shows risk for committing gun violence, rather than a blanket category for the mentally ill, and recommends that institutions and communities develop threat assessment teams that can evaluate reports of potential danger.\nAs Fox asserts, the belief that the mentally ill are more likely to take part in a mass shooting appears to be a misleading. There were 198,760 homicides committed by a firearm in the United States between 1999 and 2015, according to the National Center for Health Statistic. Despite the high number, the APA report from 2016 says that fewer than 1 percent of firearm homicides are committed by a person diagnosed with a mental illness.\nMetzl has researched the correlation between mental illness and gun violence, and he said that it\u2019s a tenuous connection at best.\n\"There\u2019s no mental illness diagnosis that explains causality,\" Metzl said. \"There\u2019s no mental illness whose symptoms are shooting anyone else. Most mental illnesses cause people to withdraw from society.\"", "Dr. Robert Cowan is Higgins Family Professor of Neurology and Director of the Headache Program at Stanford University.

He was part of the team building the consumer version of the device.\nAt the time, Wong's departure from Glass was viewed as a high-profile poach by Facebook. It was also a blow to Glass, representing one of the first signs that Google's futuristic face-mounted computer was struggling to meet the high expectations placed on it.\nIt's not clear exactly what Wong is doing at Alphabet, which has not technically been created as the Google parent company yet (that's expected to happen later this year, though in practice Google's various divisions are already operating as if the restructuring has occurred).\nOn LinkedIn, Wong lists his new position at Alphabet simply as \"Building Blocks,\" but his current tagline gives a little more color, with the phrase \"G is for Gadgets, Glasses, and Goggles.\"\nWong rejoined Google in June (before Alphabet was officially announced), not long after Business Insider spotted Google job postings that indicated that the company could be planning to release other products in the Google Glass division, besides just the smart eyewear.\nGoogle stopped selling the initial version of Glass in January, but is now reportedly planning to distribute a new specialized enterprise version for companies to use in the workplace.\nWong was also responsible for early recruiting for Oculus, which is prepping to release its first consumer product early next year.\nWe've reached out to Wong, Google and Facebook for comment and will update if we hear back.", "UPDATE: To the delight of fans, the Fox-Disney deal has gone through with the Fantastic Four included. The original story follows.\nDisney will soon return the X-Men to Marvel Studios with the purchase of 20th Century Fox, although that doesn't mean every set will return: it looks like the Fantastic Four may stay at their adopted home.\nThe Walt Disney Company is close to acquiring 21st Century Fox's movie and TV divisions, namely 20th Century Fox. As one of Hollywood's Big Six studios, 20th Century Fox has a vast library of content that will significantly bolster Disney's expansive catalog, most notably their live-action slate that's been heavily reliant upon Lucasfilm and Marvel Studios alongside live-action remakes and re-imaginings of Disney's classic stories and characters. With Fox under their belt, Disney would control blockbuster franchises such as Alien, Avatar, and Kingsman, among others.\nThe Mouse House sees the potential in owning virtually one-third, if not more, of Hollywood and various aspects of the media industry, which would arguably (and adversely) embolden them to continue twisting theater chains' arms across the US to agree to their outrageous distribution terms. That's partially why many people believe the two companies uniting under one banner is distressing and can be potentially detrimental to the filmmaking industry. But that doesn't mean there isn't a silver lining. If a deal goes through, comic book fans may finally get to see the X-Men fight alongside the Avengers on the big screen.\nHowever, if Disney does indeed acquire 20th Century Fox, the mutant superhero team may be moving into the MCU without the Fantastic Four. Although it's been long perpetuated that Fox owns the rights to Marvel's First Family, they actually only license them; Fox doesn't own the Fantastic Four, and they never have.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, comic book sales were steadily declining, and to save themselves from potential extinction, Marvel's chiefs held a fire sale of their characters' movie and TV rights, with most big-name titles landing at studios such as Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures, and 20th Century Fox. But Stan Lee took it upon himself to find a special buyer for the Fantastic Four - arguably the most important superhero team in Marvel Comics' history. In 1983, German producer Bernd Eichinger met Lee and eventually agreed to option (not purchase) the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer's film rights (read: production rights) for $250,000 in 1986, and he would keep the rights so long as a movie for either property entered production by end of 1992.\nFinding a studio willing to front $40-45 million (approximately $79 million in 2017 dollars), though, proved difficult for the producer, since comic book movies were tough sells at the time. As the story goes, Eichinger then tasked B-movie producer Roger Corman with making a low-budget Fantastic Four film, an ashcan copy, just so he and his company, Constantin Films, could retain the superhero team's rights - and it worked, to an extent. The doomed 1994 Fantastic Four movie is the stuff of legend; a film that never released and only exists through illegal copies available online.\nIn 1993, shortly before Oley Sassone's The Fantastic Four was scheduled to premiere in January 1994, Marvel Studios co-founder Avi Arad made an eleventh-hour purchase of the movie from Eichinger and subsequently had all copies destroyed, without even seeing the movie for himself, because he felt its release would damage the Fantastic Four and Marvel brand. Eichinger then began courting blockbuster directors to direct a big-budget Fantastic Four movie before the rights expired at the turn of the century, and that's what led to the German producer forming a long-standing partnership with 20th Century Fox, due to the studio's strong relationship with Marvel Studios on Bryan Singer's X-Men film.", "Zoetis Inc.\u2019s successful public offering last week \u2013 pricing above the range on Thursday, raising $2.2 billion, the shares opening trading on Friday another 21% higher \u2013 may be a harbinger of a busy year in health-care stock issuance, if banker movements are any indication.\nZoetis\u2019s IPO was a milestone for two expanding investment banks, Jefferies Group Inc. and Guggenheim Partners LLC. For both firms it was the first time they were in lead roles (in banker parlance, \u201cbookrunners\u201d) on an IPO over $1 billion, according to Dealogic.

In a budget year with about $25 million more thanks to a recently passed 0.5 percent sales tax hike, the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday finalized the city's $301 million 2018-19 budget with some but few changes mayor's recommendations.\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 In a budget year with about $25 million more thanks to a recently passed 0.5 percent sales tax hike, the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday finalized the city's $301 million 2018-19 budget with few changes to the mayor's recommendations.\nThe adopted budget includes the same breakdown for the new sales tax revenue proposed by Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski: about $7.1 million for streets and infrastructure; nearly $6 million for public safety, including $2.2 million for 27 police officers; nearly $5.3 million for transit projects; and more than $4.1 million for affordable housing initiatives. The rest would be held in reserves.\n\"We are committed to tackling bedrock issues with this budget,\" Council Chairwoman Erin Mendenhall said in a prepared statement issued after the vote. \"The budget funds many needed services and projects, and it works in concert with a possible fall bond vote that would fund major repairs to our road system.\"\nThat possible bond vote is next on the City Council's list to consider placing on the November ballot to help fund street reconstruction.\nBiskupski didn't attend Tuesday night's meeting, but her deputy chief of staff, David Litvack, applauded the City Council for passing the budget.\n\"This is just another example of how the administration and the council work well together,\" Litvack said.\nThe budget approval came despite protests from a group of about a dozen people from Utahns Against Police Brutality, who held a rally on the steps of the Salt Lake City-County building prior to Tuesday's council meeting to protest the hiring of 27 more police officers.\n\"Instead of hiring 27 more cops, why don't we put a drug rehab center in Glendale or Rose Park?\" Carlos Martinez asked the council prior to the vote. \"Get to the real heart of the issue. You think the heart of the issue for crime and drugs is because of lack of police? No, it's because of poverty. It's because of lack of access to resources.\"\nSeveral more protestors urged city officials to not hire more police, but the City Council moved forward with the budget as proposed. That's despite some council members' previous misgivings with Biskupski not funding the full 50 officers the council previously hoped to hire, though Biskupski and her staff has said she still intends to fund all 50 in future budget years.\nStill, the council proceeded with the budget mostly as-is, though they did make some changes or added some specific requests.\nThose included some objectives for the $5.3 million for transit funding.\nThe council will need to approve an interlocal agreement between the city and Utah Transit Authority to implement enhanced routes for increased coverage in underserved areas, particularly the west side; increase ridership, particularly in the city's downtown core; built out infrastructure on the city's Transit Master Plan routes; and to budget and plan a timeline for service on 1000 North, 600 North, 200 South, 900 South and 2100 South, with 400 South to be implemented last.\nOther changes included an additional $2 million to about $1 million previously budgeted to reconstruct 300 West from 600 South to 2100 South in order to bring the city's match to $3 million to qualify for a $12 million federal grant.\nThey also included an additional $150,000 to hire two new full-time fire department employees.", "Younger people are twice as likely to miss work through illness as their older colleagues, according to a new survey.\nUnder-30s are more likely to stay at home while suffering from colds and flu, allergies and intolerances than over-55s, figures showed.\nYounger people were also more likely to take time off work due to stress, tiredness and feeling run down, which the older contingent said would not be a reason to call in sick.\nAlmost one in five people aged 18 to 29 admitted they had missed work because they were \"too hung-over\", but 85 per cent of over-55s said they would only miss work if they were bedridden.\nThe higher rates of illness in younger people could be explained by the impact of unhealthy lifestyles, the survey of 3,000 people suggested.\nMen and women aged 30 and under were more likely to eat junk food like ready meals and takeaways than older people, and were half as likely to eat the five daily portions of fruit and vegetables that experts recommend.\nOlder people also showed a more positive outlook towards their wellbeing, with 59 per cent believing they are healthier than their parents compared with just 37 per cent of the younger group.\nA number of under-30s reported that they often fall ill as a result of stress, with work-related pressures, money issues and relationship problems among the most common causes.\nIn contrast, fewer than a quarter of over-55s who replied to the survey said they often felt unwell due to stress at work.\nHigh levels of stress could cause symptoms including irritability, headaches, tiredness and upset stomachs, respondents said.\nPeter Morton, the marketing manager of multivitamin manufacturer Multibionta, which commissioned the survey, said: \u201cToday\u2019s fast paced, work-hard play-hard lifestyle appears to be taking its toll on the younger generation.\nPrevious surveys have suggested that the nature of someone's job can have a major impact on how many days they miss through illness.\nOffice for National Statistics data from 2008 showed that call centre workers and other customer service staff were the profession most likely to call in sick.\nSome 4.8 per cent took at least one day off in a sample week \u2013 almost double the national average of 2.5 per cent \u2013 while train drivers, pilots and air traffic controllers were the least likely to miss work.\nA report by PricewaterhouseCoopers earlier this year estimated that absenteeism costs UK businesses \u00a332 billion each year, with British workers taking almost twice as many sick days as their American counterparts.\nThe real cost could be even higher because the figure is based on the direct cost of wages paid to absent employees earning an average of \u00a325,000 a year, and does not take into account other factors like lost productivity, the report said.\nEmployees in Britain take an average of ten days' unscheduled absence from work each year compared with 5.5 days in America and 4.5 days in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAbout 80 per cent of absenteeism is down to illness while jury service and compassionate leave account for the remainder.", "Terry Lenzner has written a vivid, tantalizing portrayal of his role as a prosecutor, defense lawyer and private investigator at or near center stage in an extraordinary range of events that captivated and traumatized the Western world during the last half of the 20th century. Among the events: the murders of three civil rights workers near Philadelphia, Miss.; the supposed plot of antiwar activists to kidnap Henry Kissinger; the Watergate investigation and the resignation of President Richard Nixon; CIA assassination plots; the deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed; the impeachment of President Bill Clinton; and the apprehension of the Unabomber. With a list like that, it's hard to believe it's all true.\nYet at first, in reading \"The Investigator,\" I found myself in complete agreement with blurbs on the book jacket by, among others, Cokie Roberts (\"If you want to read riveting true-story crime-busting tales, this is your book\"), Leslie Stahl (\"A fascinating work of history, absorbing and fun to read\"), and my brother-in-law, Jonathan Alter (Lenzner is \"a great storyteller and shrewd judge of character who tells us \u2014 finally \u2014 where so many of the important bodies are buried\").\nAlthough Lenzner presents no sensational new disclosures about Watergate, his perspective as deputy counsel and chief investigator for the Senate committee that investigated the scandal is fascinating. He speculates, as others have, that the burglary's purpose was to search and destroy evidence that Howard Hughes funneled a $100,000 cash bribe to Nixon through Bebe Rebozo in exchange for political favors \u2014 among them Attorney General John Mitchell's approval of the Hughes empire's acquisition of the Las Vegas Dunes Hotel over the objection of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. Nixon, or so Lenzner's theory goes, personally ordered the Watergate burglary, believing that Democratic National Committee Chairman Lawrence O'Brien, a former Hughes lobbyist, possessed documentary evidence of the bribe.\nRebozo, Nixon's close friend, \"grudgingly acknowledged that he had received two $50,000 cash payments from Hughes,\" Lenzner writes, but claimed he put the money in a safe deposit box and \"never touched it.\" Soon after that disclosure, Rebozo and his lawyer met with U.S. Sen. Sam Ervin, chairman of the Watergate committee, and opened a briefcase filled with stacks of $100 bills, claiming this proved the Hughes money hadn't been distributed. But an examination of the bills established that several of them had been issued after the date Rebozo claimed to have received the cash.\nThe matter wasn't pursued because Rebozo fled the country. The now-deceased O'Brien never commented, constrained perhaps because his or other Democratic hands were as dirty as Nixon's. There is little doubt that Hughes, to quote Lenzner, was \"a bipartisan ATM.\"\nSuch is the stuff \u2014 it's just one of myriad examples in the book \u2014 that left me, a former muckraker, in awe of Lenzner's career, driven, as it seemed, by high-mindedness justifying the book's subtitle: \"Fifty Years of Uncovering the Truth.\"\nBy happenstance, however, I discovered something disquieting. In a six-page section two-thirds of the way through the book, Lenzner dubiously takes considerable personal credit for the arrest of the Unabomber. Had it not been for him, Lenzner suggests, additional murders might have occurred. Initially, I had no reason to question what he says, and I certainly didn't set out to investigate \"The Investigator.\" I just happened to know someone who had been integrally involved in the case: Susan Swanson, who at the time was an investigator in the Chicago office of Lenzner's detective agency, Investigative Group International.\nSwanson had been approached about the case by a close friend since childhood, Linda Patrik, who said that she and her husband, David Kaczynski, suspected that the Unabomber might be David's older brother, Theodore Kaczynski, a reclusive mathematical prodigy living in the wilds of Montana. Their suspicion had been aroused by unusual phraseology that appeared both in letters Ted had written to the family and in the so-called Unabomber Manifesto, which recently had been published by The New York Times and Washington Post.\nI was in our Washington office when Susan called to tell me about the case. We decided to have a conference call with David Kaczynski to learn more about his suspicions and explore what we might do to help him. ... He sounded cautious, hesitant, and probably scared about the possibility that his older brother could be the Unabomber. ... Susan and I decided to contact an expert profiler named Clint Van Zandt. We asked him to compare Ted's typed letters to the Manifesto, looking for similarities in ideas, tone, syntax, and vocabulary. ... Van Zandt's first report, though not conclusive, found striking similarities. ... At the same time, we matched the postmarks on the letters ... with the locations of various bombings. A pretty devastating pattern emerged. Ted Kaczynski always seemed to be in the right place at the right time.\nI called David personally to convey the results of the investigation thus far. I told him that the evidence wasn't conclusive, but it was persuasive that his brother was the likely Unabomber. As I relayed what we'd found, David seemed startled, if not shocked.\n\"I'm recommending that you go to the FBI with this information,\" I told him.\nTo my great relief he didn't. He said, \"I think you're right.\"\nAfter reading the section, Swanson minced no words. \"What rot,\" was her characterization of Lenzner's account. She told me that the telephone conversations to which Lenzner refers simply didn't occur. \"Most galling,\" she wrote in an email message, \"Lenzner claims he told David to go to the FBI with the information. Lenzner has never talked with David Kaczynski. ... Lenzner did not talk to me about this case until after Ted was arrested. Then he tried to spin this silly story to reporters about how he was involved. ... All fabricated.\"\nBoth David Kaczynski and Van Zandt, the professional profiler who compared Ted Kaczynski's letters with the manifesto, told me essentially the same thing. Kaczynski emphasized in an email message that he and his wife had \"wrestled, as a couple, with a horrible dilemma, figured out strategies together, and came to one mind about the actions that needed to be taken\" before his wife contacted Swanson.\n\"Just to be clear,\" David said in another email message, \"I've never in my life had any contact with Terry Lenzner \u2014 not in person, not by phone, by email, nor post. Nor has any third party delivered a message from him to me.\" In a telephone interview, Van Zandt told me: \"Terry Lenzner had nothing to do with this. He's not just adding a caboose to the story. He's pretending to be the engine.\"\nWhen I asked Lenzner to respond, he told me: \"If that's their memory, that's fine. It conflicts with mine. ... I have a specific recollection of talking to David. ... That's my recollection, and I stand by that.\"\nMemoirs, of course, by their nature, tend to be self-aggrandizing \u2014 they are not written under oath \u2014 and even though the writer and subject are one and the same, given the slippery hold of memory on reality, mistakes are inevitable. That said, it's hard to imagine that the conflict in this instance stems merely from imperfect recollections of what occurred. The preponderance of the evidence weighs heavily against Lenzner's version, casting doubt on the veracity of the rest of the book. Lenzner has proven himself a great storyteller; the question, though, is how much should we believe?\nRob Warden, a former investigative reporter and editor at the Chicago Daily News and Chicago Lawyer, is co-founder and executive director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University School of Law.", "Sitar virtuoso Mohamed Assani plans to use his MusicFest Vancouver concert to launch a new album\u2014and given that the title of said CD is Spirit of Tradition, his repertoire is going to lean toward the more conservative side of what he does.\nWhat his performance might not fully indicate, however, is why Assani\u2019s recent arrival in Vancouver\u2014he moved here from the U.K. in October of last year\u2014is very good news for the local world-music community, and for our city\u2019s cultural life in general. Like his tabla-playing accompanist Cassius Khan, who came to Vancouver from Edmonton in 2008, Assani is both a musician who\u2019s deeply rooted in the artistic traditions of South Asia and a one-of-a-kind innovator who\u2019s bent on ensuring that those age-old forms will survive, and grow, in the modern era.\nIn terms of his performing career, Assani is an anomaly: he\u2019s equally skilled on sitar and tabla, although he won\u2019t be playing percussion at Christ Church Cathedral this weekend. While all practitioners of North Indian music learn its complex rhythms as a matter of course, instruction is usually in oral form\u2014students essentially learn to speed-rap the beats\u2014rather than through hands-on drumming lessons.\nAnd his style on sitar is especially rich, as he\u2019s trained in the Poonch gharana, or school, founded by the late Bengali master Vilayat Khan. Members of this gharana specialize in the long, slow development of melodic material, often using techniques borrowed from South Asia\u2019s great devotional singers. It\u2019s almost the polar opposite of the more familiar Maihar gharana, as epitomized by Ravi Shankar\u2019s exuberant approach.\nVocal techniques have also influenced the playing of percussionist Khan, a brilliant drummer who is also North America\u2019s only practitioner of the singing style known as tarranum ang gayaki, which the Fijian-born musician learned from his aunt, the late \u201cQueen of Melody\u201d Malika-e-Tarranum Mushtari Begum.\nAs Khan explains in a separate interview, his chosen form is a free-flowing and deeply meditative approach to the ghazal, a form of sung or spoken poetry that conflates the spiritual and sensual worlds. Making his ability to combine this with percussion all the more startling is that tarranum ang gayaki is similar to free verse in that it\u2019s not tethered to a predictable structure. Playing the tabla, on the other hand, is all about precise rhythmic subdivisions.\nKhan won\u2019t sing at Assani\u2019s MusicFest concert. After it, however, he plans to jump in his car and head down Burrard Street to Canada Place, where he\u2019s been booked to play three shows at the South Asian Family Association\u2019s Sawan Mela festival.\n\u201cThe first performance is going to be with my wife, Amika Kushwaha,\u201d he says. \u201cShe is going to present a kathak [Indian classical dance] solo recital, and of course we never do anything with taped music; we\u2019re very sensitive about that. So my wife\u2019s sister, Lavika, is flying in from Saskatoon to play the harmonium for Amika, and I\u2019ll play the tabla for her. Afterwards, we\u2019re playing for a young musical prodigy, [14-year-old singer] Akhil Jobanputra; his musicians, unfortunately, were not able to perform with him, so he asked my wife and I if we could accompany him on harmonium and tabla. And then the d\u00e9nouement will be mine. I will be performing ghazal while playing tabla, and then I\u2019m going to play a blistering tabla solo recital at the end.\nFor the moment, Khan is concentrating on his solo career as possibly the world\u2019s only tabla-playing ghazal singer, but he\u2019s already made his mark in B.C.\u2019s larger musical scene through collaborations with Vancouver Island Dobro master Doug Cox and fingerstyle guitarist Don Alder. And while Assani is still settling in to his new city\u2014and to his new job, teaching sitar and tabla at the Vancouver Symphony\u2019s school of music\u2014he\u2019s planning to perform with the Vancouver Inter-Cultural Orchestra this fall. Further developments may well be in the offing.\nVancouver\u2019s world-music scene\u2014already one of the best anywhere\u2014might be about to get a whole lot more interesting.\nMohamed Assani performs at Christ Church Cathedral at noon on Saturday (August 13). Later that day, Cassius Khan will make three Sawan Mela appearances at Canada Place.\nCassius Khan is one of the shining gems of our country. He is one of the greatest human beings and musicians to come out of Canada.", "Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Southeastern Michigan celebrated its 100th anniversary with an open house and airshow headlined by the Thunderbirds and featuring one of the best flying lineups of any airshow this year.\nThe Trojan Horsemen making their first pass during Saturday\u2019s airshow.\nLocated about 20 miles northeast of Detroit on the shore of Lake St. Clair, the base is named after Army Lt. Thomas Selfridge, who, in 1908, became the first person to die in an airplane crash. While on a demonstration flight with Orville Wright himself at the controls, one of the aircraft\u2019s propellers broke, causing a vibration that damaged the aircraft enough to send it into a nosedive. Less than ten years after the crash, the Joy Aviation Field was established on the shores of Lake St. Clair as a test site for the Packard Motor Company\u2019s early aviation engines, and was then taken over by the US Government for use as an Army Air Service training facility when the United States joined World War I.\nOne of only nine military airfields at the time, Selfridge\u2019s became the home of the Curtiss JN-4 Jenny, the first in a line of base aircraft that would eventually include everything from Spads and Mustangs to Vipers and Warthogs. Selfridge was an early training base for the Tuskegee Airmen, and has earned the nickname \u201cHome of the Generals\u201d by hosting famed aviators Curtis LeMay, Carl Spaatz, and Jimmy Doolittle during their careers.\nToday, Selfridge ANGB is home to personnel from all five branches of the armed forces, as well as a Customs and Border Protection patrol wing, owing to its location just 10 miles from the Canadian border. The main Air National Guard unit is the 127th Air Wing, which includes the Michigan Red Devils of the 107th Fighter Squadron flying A-10Cs and the 171st Air Refueling Squadron flying the KC-135R. Selfridge is also one of five ANG bases being considered to house an F-35 squadron, which would see the return of fighters to the skies over Southeastern Michigan for the first time in nearly a decade.\nThe airshow\u2019s Friday night kickoff party was headlined by the country band A Thousand Horses and featured a night airshow with afterburner passes from Randy Ball\u2019s MiG-17F, skydiving by the all-female Misty Blues team, and an aerobatic pyrotechnic show from Bill Leff in a T-6.\nEach show day began with the national anthem and a traditional flag jump from the Misty Blues with the jumpers being circled by Buck Roeteman in a Pitts biplane. After all of the jumpers were on the ground and their aircraft landed, Buck launched into a teaser routine, wringing out his yellow and black airplane to open the flying portion of the show.\nIn keeping with the theme of Selfridge\u2019s centennial, the flying program was set up in chronological order, showcasing the base\u2019s history and the progress of US military aviation. First up were a trio of WWI-era aircraft, with replicas of a Fokker Dr.1, a Sopwith Strutter, and a Nieuport 28 taking to the skies and weaving a figure-8 pattern over the field. The formation opened the show in place of a JN-4 Jenny, as the originally scheduled aircraft was damaged in a forced landing on the way to Michigan for the show. Thankfully, pilot Terry Richardson was not seriously injured.\nWith the fragile WWI planes back on the ground, the WWII portion of the show began with a mass launch of fighters, trainers, bombers, and even transports, nearly all of which have ties to Selfridge. Airshow fans were treated to a number of passes from a P-39, P-40, P-51C, P-51D, B-17G, B-25, C-47, Hawker Hurricane, and a handful of T-6 Texans/SNJs. Each aircraft was able to make a number of flat and photo passes and the Tora Bomb Squad provided strafing and bomb effects to add to the ambiance. In the hands of skilled aviators, the rare warbirds were able to put on an impressive show and filled the skies with the sounds of freedom as heard in 1945. The Trojan Horsemen flew next, putting the mighty T-28s on display with a combination of formation grace and solo performance demonstrations similar to other formation teams, albeit with the growl of large radial engines as they carved graceful arcs across the sky. The Bremont Horsemen P-51 demo team was also scheduled to perform at the show, but cancelled for unknown reasons. The remaining warbirds did a great job of filling in the gap, and a short demo by the Tuskegee Airmen P-51C gave fans their fix of Merlin noise for the day!\nGreg Colyer and his Lockheed T-33 \u201cAce Maker II\u201d brought the show into the jet age much as the T-33/P-80 airframe did for the US Air Force just after WWII. Colyer\u2019s routine is familiar to East Coast airshow fans, and it is always a treat to see his graceful handling of America\u2019s first jet trainer. A short deviation from history was next, as Greg Koontz went up for his first demonstration of the day in an Extreme Decathalon. The high-wing red monoplane is used for basic aerobatic training and competition, and Koontz showed his mastery of the aircraft, flying an impressive routine managing energy and performing crisp maneuvers all while narrating his routine live from the cockpit in his signature easygoing Southern style.\nThe Korea portion of the show was represented by Paul Keppler in his F-86 Sabre flying a short demonstration aboard one of the best looking fighters ever to grace the skies. This particular airframe is painted in the colors flown by Maj. James Jabara, the first jet ace in the USAF and the second highest scoring USAF pilot of the Korean conflict.\nAirshow fans were treated with Dr. Joe Masessa\u2019s rare OV-1 Mohawk as one of the aircraft to take to the skies during the Vietnam commemoration. In addition to the tri-tailed twin-turboprop observation plane, an F-100 Super Sabre and a MiG-17 took to the skies, and all three aircraft mixed it up with mock dogfights. The MiG was slated to go head to head with the Collings Foundation\u2019s F-4 Phantom, but maintenance issues grounded the aircraft before it could even get to Selfridge. Even without the Phantom, the show delighted with the Mohawk\u2019s simulated attack runs, the F-100\u2019s distinctive afterburner pop, and the flickering trail of fire coming from the back of Randy Ball\u2019s MiG-17. Dean Cutshall\u2019s F-100F Super Sabre is one of only a handful of surviving airframes from an initial production run of over 2,200. With such rarities in the air, the Vietnam-era display was truly an avgeek\u2019s dream.\nThanks to a last minute authorization from Air Combat Command, Selfridge Airshow patrons were treated to an unplanned act at the show that brought the present and possible future of the base together in the sky. One of the F-35s in town for the static display at the show took off and joined in formation with the newly-painted 107th Fighter Squadron centennial commemorative A-10C (81-0994) for a heritage flight. While the F-35 was limited to a few formation passes and a pattern, the sight of the A-10 next to a 5th generation stealth fighter was impressive, and an powerful display of the broad capability and mission range of the US Air Force and Air National Guard.\nHaving launched earlier, four other Selfridge based A-10s, along with a KC-135R were soon overhead for the hometown Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) demonstration. After the Hogs passed overhead with the Stratotanker in a simulated aerial refueling position, the SANDY flight of A-10s began to make strafing and bomb runs in support of a \u201cdowned aviator\u201d in need of rescue. After suppressing the hostile forces, a Coast Guard MH-65D Dolphin from the Selfridge-based CG Air Station Detroit played the role of rescuer, landing at show center to pick up the stranded pilot as the KC-135R made passes overhead. While not as involved as some of the combined arms demonstrations at other shows, the joint display at Selfridge allowed three hometown units from two different services to show off their capabilities to the gathered crowds.\nJacquie Warda, known as \u201cJacquie B\u201d took to the skies next in her Extra 300L and tumbled around the airspace over Selfridge. Having not taken up aerobatics until she turned 50, Jacquie B has become a prominent member of the airshow performing community and hopes that her performances inspire other ladies both young and young at heart to take wing and discover the joys of aviation.\nThe US Navy was represented by the Legacy Hornet TACDEMO from the VFA-106 Gladiators, based at NAS Oceana in Virginia Beach, VA. Lt. Nick \u201cBearshark\u201d Green and Lt. Joe \u201cPound\u201d Ash both flew aggressive and entertaining demos in an F/A-18C. From takeoff to touchdown, the pilots exhibited the full subsonic flight envelope of the current backbone of the Navy\u2019s air arm from the tail-sitting high alpha pass to the high-speed photo pass that closes out the demonstration. NYCAviation was on hand prior to Friday\u2019s demo to experience the professionalism and skill that goes on behind the scenes, as the pilots briefed the demonstration and the ground crews prepared and launched the fighter for the performance. It goes without saying that none of the noise and vapor would be possible without the hard work of the team on the ground who make sure the pilots have a safe and reliable aircraft.\nBuck Roeteman\u2019s full demo followed the Hornet, and provided him additional time in the aerobatic box to show off the agility of his Pitts. The black and yellow color scheme provides a bit of a nostalgia as it matches the livery used by the late Jim LeRoy who was one of the most well-known civilian aerobatic pilots of the past few decades. Buck\u2019s performance included a low-altitude ribbon cut in addition to a series of maneuvers that showed just what a Pitts can do.\nWith Roeteman\u2019s Pitts back on the ground, the field was turned over to America\u2019s Ambassadors in Blue (or Red on Sunday), the US Air Force Thunderbirds. With an absence of convenient staging areas, the Thunderbirds did not perform their ground show, and taxied out to the runway immediately after taking the field to begin their demonstration. The six red, white, and blue F-16s performed for the better part of an hour, slicing through the sky in their traditional mix of familiar tight formations, head on opposing passes, and displays of the performance envelope of the most numerous and nimble fighter in the Air Force inventory.\nOn Sunday, NYCAviation had the honor of seeing the Thunderbirds perform from a perspective rarely seen: at the comm cart with members of the team. In addition to the narration and communications hub, the team\u2019s PA music, safety observation, weather updates, show video, and centerpoint signals all come directly from the team members around the team\u2019s trailer known as \u201cJudy.\u201d As one would imagine, the level of professionalism and camaraderie among the team members was truly a spectacle to witness firsthand, and it is evident that the team not only enjoys their jobs, but sincerely enjoy spending time on the road working together. As a bonus, the photos were captured on Sunday, as the T-Birds donned their special red flight suits in celebration of the 100th Anniversary of Selfridge. Ending a show weekend with such an intimate look at one of the world\u2019s premier demonstration teams was going out on a high note for an already memorable show and the experience was one that this airshow fan will never forget.\nThe author would like to thank the 127th Wing and the rest of Team Selfridge for hosting the airshow and for 100 years of standing ready to help keep the USA safe. Additional heartfelt thanks are owed to the US Navy TACDEMO Team, LiveAirshowTV crew, the Selfridge sound team, and the US Air Force Thunderbirds for everyone\u2019s assistance in ensuring the photos that accompany this article could happen.", "Of the four Republicans competing for the Cape and South Shore congressional seat that Democrat Bill Delahunt is vacating, two - state Department of Public Utilities lawyer Robert Hayden of Hanover and certified public accountant Raymond Kasperowicz of Cohasset - are impassioned newcomers who nonetheless lack sufficient knowledge of the issues. The other two - former state Treasurer Joseph Malone of Scituate and state Representative Jeffrey Perry of Sandwich - are highly experienced but also carry some unfortunate baggage.\nFor Malone, however, the blemish on his record - the theft of $9.4 million by several of his Treasurer's office aides - does not reflect on his own character, and should be weighed against improvements he made in overseeing the lottery and state pension funds. His political experience, combined with his welcoming personality, make him a potential bridge-builder in Congress. Such skills will be important were he to become the only Republican in the state delegation. Though he promises to oppose much of President Obama's agenda, Malone is less doctrinaire in his conservatism than Perry, who casts himself in the Ronald Reagan mode and, on immigration at least, to Reagan's right.\nNot only has Perry provided unsatisfying accounts of his role in defending a subordinate officer accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, but the Wareham chief once testified that he had passed Perry over for a promotion because the chief believed Perry had not been \"100 percent truthful\" to him.\nPerry has denied the red-light allegation, but his failure to provide a convincing explanation for the chief's comments puts a question mark in front of his candidacy.\nMalone lacks Perry's consistency and grounding in a firm set of beliefs. Malone's views on abortion rights, for example, have shifted; once pro-life, he currently supports the guidelines in Roe v. Wade.\nBut his pragmatic approach delivered good results for much of his eight years as treasurer, during which time he reduced operating expenses and pushed for the cost-saving merger of two public employee pension funds. Just after he left office, however, investigators revealed his aides' theft of $9.4 million. The investigation did not implicate Malone, but it called into question his judgment and the quality of his supervision. Tenth district Republicans should vote for Malone while hoping that he now understands one of the edicts of Reagan, the godfather of modern conservatism: Trust, but verify.\nDemocrat Rob O'Leary. Ana Paulina photo.\nThe retirement of Representative William Delahunt after 14 years provides for turnover in the mostly long-tenured Massachusetts congressional delegation and, for 10th district voters, a new direction. The two Democrats vying for the seat, state Senator Robert O'Leary and Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating, share similar career paths and political leanings as the retiring congressman. Neither is a new face. Their strengths - legislative ability, knowledge of policy, a ground-level understanding of the district - would be formidable in any other cycle. As it is, the winner will have to persuade a skeptical, increasingly conservative electorate that he will make a tangible difference for the district.\nWhile both make strong cases, O'Leary's expertise in education and his crucial role in building support for this year's ed-reform bill on Beacon Hill, which paved the way for a much-coveted $250 million federal education grant, sets him apart.\nEducation, at all levels, is central to Massachusetts' economic development strategy, and O'Leary, an adjunct community college professor with a Ph.D. in history, has been a statewide leader in both higher-ed and K-12 policy. For the 10th District, which runs from the South Shore suburbs of Boston to Cape Cod, improving education is the key to attracting businesses and creating a diversified economy. For the state of Massachusetts, having a representative who could deliver immediate impact in those areas of core concern would be a boost. Among Massachusetts' 10 representatives, only John Tierney focuses heavily on education.\nOn fast-growing Cape Cod, O'Leary has been a force for the smart-growth initiatives that helped attack sprawl and preserve open land, while allowing the Cape to flourish as a year-round community.\nO'Leary has been a leader on other issues. He worked to strike a balance between commercial uses and conservation in state coastal waters. On fast-growing Cape Cod, O'Leary has been a force for the smart-growth initiatives that helped attack sprawl and preserve open land, while allowing the Cape to flourish as a year-round community. He is shrewd in identifying institutions like the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute as possible incubators of economic spin-offs and job creation. A member of the state Senate small-business committee, he is familiar with the needs of a district in which most jobs are in small businesses. As the first Democrat to represent his state-Senate district in four decades, he's won the confidence of relatively conservative voters for his progressive agenda.\nO'Leary's pragmatic progressivism does not extend to the Cape Wind project, which he, like most of his constituents, opposed as a detriment to the Cape's offshore environment. Keating also opposed the project until recently, when he revised his view in light of the importance of clean energy to the state's economic future. That's to his credit. But O'Leary has at least acknowledged that Cape Wind will go forward, and urged constituents to accept that reality.\nKeating's credentials are every bit as strong as O'Leary's, and his successful tenures as both a state senator and Norfolk DA arguably give him a broader range of experiences. His first priority in Congress, he says, will be creating jobs by bolstering small businesses. He says he will seek a position on the House Judiciary Committee, and develop a national focus on criminal-justice issues. As proof of his political courage, he cites his 1994 challenge to the iron grip of then-Senate President William Bulger.\nKeating, too, would be a credit to the district and to Massachusetts. But his criminal-justice focus is less timely, and potentially less consequential for the district and state. O'Leary's energy and priorities make him the better of two well-qualified candidates.", "GREENWOOD, S.C. -- Christopher G. Reynolds, Jr. attended a religious service in early 2012 when a church leader called all high school seniors to the front of the room. The church leader, performing an annual tradition, directed Reynolds and his peers to announce their goals following high school graduation in May. Reynolds\u2019 mother and father never expected their son\u2019s answer. Reynolds, 19, announced his plan to become a U.S. Marine publicly for the first time during service that morning. His answer shocked both his family and friends. His father, Reynolds Sr., said he knew his son had great potential, but he never thought he would go to such an extreme. The veteran said he discussed the military with his son, but he focused primarily on the U.S. Navy because of his 13 years of service. After a discussion following the ceremony, he knew that his son was very serious about his decision. Reynolds and his father visited a Greenwood, S.C. recruiting office in June 2012 shortly after graduating from Greenwood Christian School. However, they were left speechless following the initial visit with a recruiter. Staff Sgt. Matthew B. McGarvey, the staff noncommissioned officer-in-charge of Recruiting Substation Lexington and a former recruiter in Greenwood, informed Reynolds that he would have to lose 45 pounds to enlist and an additional 15 to begin training. This information left Reynolds 60 pounds away from achieving his newfound dream. \u201cI felt for him,\u201d Reynolds, Sr., said. \u201cHe had built up a desire to do it and he worked so hard up until that point. I didn\u2019t feel like he couldn\u2019t do it, but I realized it would be a difficult challenge for him.\u201d Reynolds faced a problem that he shared with 23.9 million other children and adolescents, according to the American Heart Association. He was obese, weighing approximately 230 pounds. Reynolds said he never worried about his body or weight. He loved good food and had plenty of it around him with limited exercise throughout high school. He assumed he would eventually have to lose some weight, but his assumption was far from reality.\nReynolds was sure it would take him at least a year before he could lose 45 pounds, but his recruiter thought otherwise. McGarvey informed Reynolds about physical training with the enlistees in the Delayed Entry Program. He encouraged Reynolds to attend as many training functions as possible to help him start shedding pounds.\nHe accepted his recruiter\u2019s invitation, attending physical training sessions throughout each week while working at the local BI-LO supermarket. He was reminded of his goal of becoming a Marine every day he arrived to work because he knew that\u2019s where he would remain if he failed to earn the title. He also altered his diet by eating healthier foods and drinking more water to help support his new exercise regimen. \u201cAt first, I thought the Marines may not be the right thing for me,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cBut the motivation from the recruiters and the enlistees helped me along the way. I would not have reached my goal if it were not for their help.\u201d Reynolds\u2019 father admits he was not as confident as Staff Sgt. McGarvey. He said his son had difficulty staying committed to a particular goal, such as playing football. He also did not think his son would be able to lose that much weight in such a short amount of time. His son overcame adversity and doubt by losing 45 pounds two months later. \u201cIt was one of the happiest days of my life,\u201d Reynolds said, referring to the moment when Staff Sgt. McGarvey confirmed his qualification to enlist. \u201cI ran around the house yelling. I was so pumped and ready.\u201d He enlisted in the Marine Corps Delayed Entry Program in August 2012, still anxious to lose an additional 15 pounds to become qualified to attend Marine Corps Recruit Training.\nReynolds\u2019 father, who witnessed his son begin to transform while in the DEP, could not help but recognize McGarvey\u2019s support between June and August when his son was ineligible to enlist. He was well aware that his son did not contribute to McGarvey\u2019s mission as a recruiter, especially considering the fact that the odds were against his son from the very beginning.\n\u201cI was impressed with Staff Sgt. McGarvey because I have never seen someone take that much interest in my son,\u201d Reynolds, Sr., said. \u201cAny encouragement from Staff Sgt. McGarvey, he took seriously.\u201d Reynolds continued to lose weight throughout the next five months, losing an additional 15 pounds while gaining muscle mass. He departed for recruit training on Jan. 13 within the established weight standard. Upon arriving at Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, S.C., Reynolds developed an even greater understanding for his physical preparation, automatically questioning his decision to enlist.\n\u201cWhat did I get myself in to,\u201d Reynolds said, remembering his first night on the island. \u201cI expected a mental and physical challenge, but I was not aware of how tough it really is. You get to a point where you think you can\u2019t do it, and it really starts to wear you down.\u201d Reynolds said he found motivation through his fellow recruits. Their motivation helped him to regain commitment in his goal to become a Marine. He overcame the physical and mental challenges of training, graduating on April 12. He earned the title of Marine and lost an additional 15 pounds while at recruit training.\n\u201cHe left here a boy, and then there was a man standing in front of me,\u201d Reynolds Sr. said, after seeing his son for the first time since he left in January. \u201cThis was the first time in his life that he went full force toward what he wanted. We are very proud to see him put forth so much effort to achieve his goal.\u201d McGarvey said Pfc. Reynolds is an example of a young man who realized his true potential, losing 75 pounds along the way.\nReynolds, who enlisted in the Marine Corps Security Forces (Presidential Support) occupational field, will attend infantry training at Camp Geiger, N.C., followed by security forces training in Chesapeake, Va.", "JOHNSON VALLEY \u2014 Jacob Argubright claimed the opening round of the Kenda/SRT AMA Hare & Hound National Championship Series in Johnson Valley on Jan. 27.\nA Hare and Hound race is an open desert motorcycle race that features two (or sometimes more) laps around different loops instead of multiple laps around a single loop. The second lap (the hound) is often much more difficult than the first (the hare).\nTwo-hundred forty riders took off in three waves, with the top pro racers going first, to start the first of two 40-mile laps.\nLap one was a relatively easy and the top riders began coming through the pits near the finish line within an hour. Kendall Norman, who had passed early leader Joe Wassen.\nHesperia\u2019s Ricky Brabec, back from his heartbreaking run in the Dakar Rally, was close behind. Brabec was leading overall with two stages to go until his engine broke at the Dakar Rally.\nOne by one the riders came through the pits, which are now like a NASCAR pit road, with crews waiting to quickly fuel the bikes and give the riders drinks and new googles.\nThe second lap was more technical with a lot of riding being done through some of Johnson Valley\u2019s big rock formations. Those rocks became Norman\u2019s downfall as he clipped one and knocked off his drive chain, bringing him to a stop. He fixed the chain and got back into the race but not before a number of riders passed him.\nBack out on the course, Argubright was on the move, passing a number of competitors to emerge in the lead over Brabec. For the crowd gathered at the finish line the first sign of the leaders came when Argubright emerged over the top of a hill about a mile away. He was first into a difficult section of rocks leading to the finish line and crossed with a healthy lead.\nBrabec was the next to ride over the mountain, but as he came through the finish line rocks, he fell and had to pick up the bike and get going again with Wassen was now closing on him. Brabec got the bike going and made it across the line with Wassen finishing third right behind. Next across were Tyler Lynn, Dalton Shirey, Nick Burson and then Axel Pearson. Norman, the early leader, managed to finish eighth and Chance Fullerton took ninth. The top nine were all in the Pro 450 class while 10th place finisher Daemon Wooslayer won the Pro 250 class.\nThe National Hare and Hound Series will be making several more appearances at Johnson Valley this year, with the next event racing April 28.

But it also risks undermining the traditional bipartisan support for Israel among Americans.\nNetanyahu and Trump enjoy strong personal rapport. Netanyahu also seems to relish the American president\u2019s attitude toward the Middle East, not only on Iran but also his hands-off approach to the Palestinian issue and Israeli settlement construction. After an icy eight-year relationship with Barack Obama, Netanyahu has gone out of his way to praise Trump at every turn.\nHe also has held his tongue on Trump\u2019s various scandals, even after a neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia, when Trump appeared to defend the actions of white supremacists. On a visit to Washington, Netanyahu even implored critics to stop questioning Trump over the supposed anti-Semitism of some of his supporters.\nWhile Trump\u2019s isolationism, particularly his planned pullout from Syria, may not be good for Israel, his unabashed pro-Israel rhetoric has made him popular domestically, said Nahum Barnea, one of Israel\u2019s most influential columnists.\nBeyond a confluence of interests, Trump and Netanyahu seem to share a populist streak against their countries\u2019 more liberal establishments \u2014 to the delight of their nationalist bases.\nNetanyahu has responded to a series of corruption investigations with Trump-like attacks on Israeli media, law-enforcement, judiciary and other \u201celites\u201d he believes are bent on his removal. He is quick to deride any critic as a \u201cleftist,\u201d and, like Trump, has taken to social media to whip up his base.\nTrump, who endorsed Netanyahu in a fawning pre-Israeli election clip in 2013 \u2014 even before he got into politics \u2014 appears to equally admire the Israeli leader.\nNetanyahu is not alone in tapping into Trump\u2019s appeal.\nBut only Netanyahu has molded his politics in Trump\u2019s image.\nHe has long had a rocky relationship with the media and accuses it, along with police and prosecutors, of being part of a \u201cleftist\u201d witch hunt to force him from office. Like Trump, he has also gone after former allies, floating conspiracy theories about an alleged planned putsch by a Likud rival.\nThe prime minister appears to be modeling his recent launch of \u201cLikud TV\u201d on Trump\u2019s \u201cReal News Update,\u201d a weekly webcast on Facebook hosted by the president\u2019s daughter-in-law to counterbalance what the administration deems a hostile media. Netanyahu\u2019s first clip made dismissive references about police investigations into alleged corruption by the prime minister.\nPolice have recommended indicting Netanyahu on three corruption cases, and Israel\u2019s attorney general is expected to announce his decision whether to charge him before the elections.\nBack in 2009, it was Obama who offered inspiration to Israeli campaigners. An ultra-Orthodox Jewish party translated \u201cyes we can\u201d into its campaign slogan and Netanyahu designed his Web page after Obama\u2019s. But a decade later, Trump is the hot commodity.", "Early on, Kentucky did little to save Mitchell's fingernails.\nBad offensive production and tentative play had UK trailing by as many as eight points late in the first half. Mitchell called a timeout.\n\"We were playing like we were scared to lose,\" he said. \"You have a couple of bad games and now suddenly everybody thinks they're a bad player.\"\nAfter that chat, a Kentucky team that discussed playing together before the game found a way to walk the talk and shuffled past Missouri 80-69 in Memorial Coliseum to snap the losing streak.\n\"I'm as happy as about this win as I've been in a long time,\" Mitchell said. \"We needed it bad.\"\nThe change of attitude after that timeout, with UK trailing 24-16, was the turning point in the game.\n\"Missouri stood in the paint \u2014 five people in the paint \u2014 and somebody at some point was going to have to hit a 15-footer,\" Mitchell said he told his team. \"Somebody at some point had to quit worry about being scared of losing the game and I just tried to wake them up the best that I could.\"\nHe specifically challenged Janee Thompson, whom he saw hanging her head after a couple of early missed shots. On the next possession she hit a 15-footer that started a 19-4 Kentucky run in which she scored seven points.\n\"We came into this game kind of struggling,\" said Thompson, one of five UK starters to finish in double figures. She had 16 points and six assists. \"We just needed something. In that timeout he told us to just let everything go, let loose and play and be confident. When he said that, it really picked me up.\"\nKentucky (14-3, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) started playing like a confident team again even without Evans and with reserve Bernisha Pinkett playing limited minutes with her own leg injury.\nWith those players out, Mitchell said he quietly hoped before the game that Bria Goss could get going.\nThe junior guard had a career night (23 points) one game before conference play opened and then went flat, scoring just 15 points in the next three games combined.\nGoss responded to her own personal slump in a big way on Sunday, scoring 20 points (including making all 10 of her free-throw attempts), grabbing eight rebounds and taking two charges, including a final one that ended the night for the Tigers' leading scorer.\nIt was Goss's second charge of the game and her 21st of the season, one more than she had all of last season with nearly an entire slate of league games to go.\nThe Tigers' Bri Kulas had a season high 27 points and 14 rebounds before that player control foul with 2:15 to go.\nStopping Kulas became Goss's job as well in the second half and the Missouri senior was held to just seven points after scoring 20 of the Tigers' 31 in the first half.\n\"On a day when we needed a big effort and we needed all hands on deck, she was able to get it done on both ends of the court and that is big time,\" Mitchell said of Goss.\nBut Goss, who scored UK's final 10 points of the first half, was quick to credit her teammates.\n\"Before the game, I brought the team together and said we're down another player so everybody has to step up,\" she said. \"Not just me, I knew my teammates would step up to the challenge as well.\"\nSamarie Walker had her sixth double-double of the season with 10 points and 13 rebounds. Jennifer O'Neill and DeNesha Stallworth, still coming back from knee surgery, added 11 points apiece.\n\"It was a great team win for all of us and everybody contributed in different ways,\" Stallworth said. \"That's what we'll need later on down the road.\"\nMore than anything, Kentucky needed it now.\n\"Not from the standings or our long-term future, but just for our immediate psyche right now we needed to win,\" Mitchell said after the victory, the program's 700th overall.\nUK shook off a 5-for-19 start from the field and made 21 of its next 50 shots, turning the ball over just 10 times. The Cats scored 28 points off of 17 Missouri (13-4, 2-2) miscues.\nEvans did not play on Sunday as she battles chronic leg pain that has bothered her for most of her career at UK.\nThe issue flared up on Thursday night at South Carolina and the senior guard struggled through practices this week. Kentucky is hopeful that resting it this week (including a bye on Thursday) will help fix the issue.\n\"We don't anticipate this being anything long term,\" Mitchell said of Evans, who is the Cats' third leading scorer at 11.2 points a game and had started 30 straight games before sitting out this one.\nPinkett, another senior guard, tried to play but was limited to two minutes. Before the game, UK officials said she was suffering from shin splints.", "The decision by Abington Health and Holy Redeemer Health System to call off their short-lived plans for a merger is positive news for women's health care in the Philadelphia region, and also stands as a welcome display of the pivotal influence of stakeholders and everyday consumers.\nIn pulling the plug in the face of a groundswell of public opposition, hospital officials on Wednesday continued to insist they had \"a bold vision that we believe would have served our community well\" by linking the larger and more profitable Abington with smaller Holy Redeemer.\nBut what was most striking about the merger announced just three weeks ago \u2014 and what rightly proved to be so controversial \u2014 was that it held out the prospect of immediately reducing vital services for women and, by extension, their families.\nIn keeping with prohibitions at the Catholic-run Redeemer, Abington Memorial Hospital administrators were prepared to halt abortions there.\nBeyond the impact on the 50 to 60 women who turn to Abington each year to terminate pregnancies, often due to serious complications or fetal abnormalities, there was an understandable fear among practitioners and patients alike that other reproductive care could be curtailed as well. Such a concession made even less sense, given that Abington appeared to be the dominant partner in the planned merger \u2014 yet it would be forced to eliminate critical care.\nEven though antiabortion activists viewed the expected ban as progress for their cause, which isn't surprising, the merger would have limited women's access to safe and legal abortion at a time when elsewhere in Pennsylvania, stringent new state regulations are cutting back on such access.\nRules enacted under Gov. Corbett and just taking effect have forced abortion clinics statewide to meet hospital-grade standards \u2014 or lose the right to perform surgical abortions.\nWhile Republican lawmakers pushed the rules as a needed response to a 2011 grand jury report alleging horrors at the West Philadelphia abortion clinic of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, the state's 22 legal clinics operating perfectly safely under earlier standards have had to scramble to expand staffing and make costly improvements at their facilities.\nSo far, one clinic has closed and five others have eliminated surgical abortion procedures rather than meet the added expense.\nIt's little wonder then that the Abington-Holy Redeemer partnership was such a tough sell to the general public, since it also seemed to be bad medicine.\nThat message certainly came through loud and clear in the outcry over the plans, as women's groups, clergy, area residents, and about 150 physicians affiliated with Abington Memorial lined up solidly against the merger.\nThe controversial proposal also spawned a popular Facebook page opposing the deal; and although there's no evidence of it, it's not hard to imagine that major hospital donors made their views known.\nWith national health-care reform moving ahead, some hospital mergers will be in the public interest. But as configured, the Abington-Redeemer alliance did not appear to be one of them.", "To create their post apocalyptic show Phil Lord and Chris Miller had to ask and answer questions like... where are all of the dead bodies?\nRami Malek used to skip out of his computer class in high school, which is funny because he's been playing a hacker on a hit TV show for an entire season.\nIn his new book, William Finnegan talks about what's driven his life: reporting and traveling around the world in search of the perfect wave.\nClick through to find out what you should be eating.\nA new interpretation of \"Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet\" is making its way to the big screen.

( TheStreet) -- Terry Weaver says caring for the environment goes back to his days growing up on the family farm.\nBack then, he says, his family's livelihood depended on caring for the land, air and water.\nHe brought this mentality into his professional life, forming Agri Marketing, otherwise known as USA Gypsum, in 1998.\nThe company partners with local contractors and manufacturers to collect construction drywall trimmings that would have been sent to landfills. It then recycles the scrap into natural gypsum products, a so-called soil amendment (essentially fertilizer) that is sold to farmers, homeowners and others that can be used on lawns, gardens and farms.\n\"The gypsum provides a low cost remedy for acid, sodic, and erosion prone soils. The benefits are obvious -- discarded drywall is recycled into useful products instead of going to a landfill, and the output results in reduced costs to farmers and building contractors,\" according to USA Gypsum's profile on SCORE's website.\nUSA Gypsum has dedicated itself to opportunities that respect the triple bottom line: social prosperity, environmental stewardship and profitability, making generous monthly donations to help underserved communities, including the Water Street Mission and micro-lender World Vision Micro, SCORE says.\n\"SCORE applauds the efforts by USA Gypsum to run a successful small business that is environmentally conscious, recycling used drywall to prevent landfills from overflowing,\" SCORE CEO Ken Yancey says. \"It is small businesses like USA Gypsum that achieve success while preventing pollution and useless waste in their community.\"\nWinning SCORE's Outstanding Green Small Business award (SCORE is the Small Business Administration's partner organization designed to mentor entrepreneurs), USA Gypsum is the sixth of seven 2012 winners to be profiled by TheStreet. SCORE celebrated the winners at its fourth annual awards gala in New Orleans on August 16.\nTheStreet recently spoke with USA Gypsum's president Terry Weaver.\nWhy is being a green business important today, and important to our economy?\nWeaver: The recycling of obsolete and discarded materials is nearly as old as humankind itself. While we do not go back quite that far, my commitment to improving the environment goes back to my boyhood days growing up on a family farm where our livelihood depended on caring for the land, air and water.\nDrywall recycling grew out of that farm background when we realized that drywall was primarily the mineral gypsum and 20% was wasted during construction. Local farmers were purchasing gypsum which was being mined in Nova Scotia. This was in 1998 before being \"Green\" was popular. Our society simply cannot afford to continue landfilling valuable raw materials that can be economically reclaimed.\nHow have you been able to finance your business and tell us why you chose that route?\nWeaver: Initially USA Gypsum was funded internally, using equipment vendors and receivable factoring. We did this because we were not able to obtain bank loans with acceptable terms. SCORE helped us to produce a loan package that led to proposals by all five banks approached. The financing we obtained lowered our interest rates and provided capital needed for growth.\nHow has the company been hurt by the recession? What measures did you take to ensure its resiliency?\nWeaver: The downturn in construction beginning in 2008 reduced our volume of raw materials, which are drywall scraps. We aggressively marketed to a larger geographic area using print advertising, email marketing, direct mailing and a new website. USA Gypsum also developed additional products for our end markets. The result was continued growth.\nWhat are your growth plans?\nWeaver: We are in the design and zoning stage for a new facility. The new plant will be more efficient and allow us to increase volume. We are also funding university research of new products.\nWhat has been the biggest lesson you've learned as a small business?\nWeaver: It is all about people. Customers, employees, vendors and business contacts have all contributed to growth at USA Gypsum. We strive to honor this contribution by treating them with integrity and giving back to the community and those less fortunate. A great example of giving back is our SCORE mentor, Lou Davenport, who is donating his time and vast experience to help us succeed.\n>> Think Goldman Sachs Doesn't Support Small Business Lending?", "PRINCE Harry was seen for the first time after Meghan Markle's emotional letter to her father Thomas was revealed.\nThe Duke of Sussex took in the Guinness Six Nations England v France rugby match at Twickenham Stadium.\nThe 34-year-old royal attended the match alongside former England captain Bill Beaumont and the president of the rugby federation.\nHe was seen singing the National Anthem and keeping his hands warm in the chilly weather.\nIt comes less than a day after \"devastating\" details in the letter revealed his wife begged Thomas to stop his \"painful attacks\" on her \"kind\" husband.\nThe existence of the message emerged last week after five close pals of the Meghan decided to give anonymous interviews to a US magazine bashing Thomas.\nThey claimed that Meghan wrote to her dad because she wanted to reconcile privately and was distraught over his constant media interviews.\nNow in an astonishing public rebuttal, Markle has once again chosen to speak to a newspaper and reveal the contents of his daughter\u2019s private message.\nIn the handwritten note, sent in August, Meghan addressed her father as \u201cDaddy\u201d before accusing him of breaking her heart \u201cinto a million pieces\u201d by allegedly lying in the press and publicly attacking her husband Prince Harry.\nMarkle, a former Hollywood lighting director who now lives in Mexico, did not attend his daughter\u2019s nuptials after he suffered two heart attacks days he was set to walk her down the aisle.\nShe accuses her father of being ungrateful for money she has given him and for not accepting her offer of help during his health scare last year.\nIn his response to Meghan, Thomas claims he was in hospital with \u201cmy 2nd heart attack\u201d when his daughter and Harry sent \u201chelp\u201d to his home.\nHe also denied publicly attacking Prince Harry, writing: \u201cThe only I said is if we had a disagreement, \u2018get over it\u2019\u201d.\nBut despite his daughter's anguished request for him to stop speaking to the media, Thomas signs off his response to Meghan by asking her if she and Harry would pose with him for a photo \"for the whole world to see.\"\nHe adds: \"If you and Harry don't like it? Fake it for one photo.\"", "A look back at one of Canada's beloved celebrity chefs -- Montreal-born Madame Jehane Beno\u00eet, whose warm, spontaneous manner endeared her to Canadians.\nJehane Beno\u00eet was a Cordon Bleu and Sorbonne-trained chef, but she was best known as the cheerful cook dedicated to teaching Canadians that preparing delicious, attractive food was something any home cook could do \u2014 all that was needed was basic technique and a little \"imagination.\"\nCookery was not the Montreal-born Beno\u00eet's first choice for a career \u2014 at the age of 18, she wanted to be an actress. But because her mother objected to that idea, she went on to Paris to study, soon discovering that she was meant to \"talk food.\"\nAsked by her teacher to stay and help him teach, she declared her intention instead to bring her enthusiasm about food home to Canada.\nAs ambitious as that declaration may have seemed, she did, over the course of more than four decades, bring her message to Canadians through the publication of more than 30 cookbooks, as well as newspaper and magazine articles.\nAnd \"Madame\" Beno\u00eet, as she was affectionately known, was a regular guest on CBC Television's Open House in the late 1950s and on Take 30 in the 1960s and 70s.\nSometimes she played host to a student in her studio kitchen, as she did in 1969 when Rod Coneybeare, of The Friendly Giant, was taught the basics in making cheese fondue.\n\"Is there such a thing as cooking talent?\" he asked.\nYes, she replied, but \"you also learn how to cook.\" After that, the key is using your own judgment and imagination.\nHow the food was presented was as important as how it was cooked.\nOne 1969 Take 30 episode was dedicated to her love of gathering inspiration for the food she prepared as well as how she served it. With National Gallery director Jean Sutherland Boggs, she illustrated how cooks can be inspired by still-life paintings.\nAs microwave ovens became popular with cooks in the 1970s, Beno\u00eet promoted them and adapted recipes for them.\nAppearing on Canada After Dark, with host Paul Soles, she recruited fellow guest Ren\u00e9 Simard \u2014 the popular Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois singer and variety show host \u2014 to try his hand at using a microwave to cook one of his favourite foods \u2014 hamburgers.\nShe assured an incredulous Simard that he could do it, because \"you don't have to do anything, that's a genius.\"\nHer choice of words was not accidental: She was referring to the brand name of a Panasonic-made microwave.", "The panicked emails and texts sounded like a prank worthy of the Yes Men. Occupy Wall Street -- which like some comic book character only grew stronger after each attack by nefarious forces, whether pepper spray, mass arrests or New York mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s threat to close the park for cleaning \u2013 had finally been brought to its knees.\nWhat was about to kill the most successful American activist movement in decades? The drum circle.\nDrummers possessed with a Dionysian fervor were demanding that they be allowed to pound their bongos and congas late into the night because they were the \u201cheartbeat of this movement.\u201d In response, a letter circulated with the dramatic warning that \u201cOWS is over after Tuesday.\u201d With equal doses of Middle East diplomacy and Burning Man theatrics, the writer explained that weeks of negotiations between a drummers' working group called Pulse, the OWS General Assembly and the local community board had collapsed.\nThe rogue drummers did not recognize the GA as a legitimate body whose decisions they had to obey. In fact, some drummers turned Occupy Wall Street\u2019s rhetoric against itself, claiming that the GA \u201csuppressed people\u2019s opinions\u201d and were \"becoming the government we\u2019re trying to protest.\u201d A compromise was eventually reached to allow two hours of drumming in the middle of the day, but everyone I spoke to afterward confirmed that one of the most powerful American social movements in years was nearly undone, not by its political message, but by its rhythm section.\n\"That was an important test of whether the General Assembly actually had authority over people, or whether it was more like a suggestion box for a collection of autonomous individuals,\" observes Nathan Schneider, a writer who has been chronicling Occupy Wall Street since its beginnings last summer.\nThe drummers actually did the movement a favor. For nearly every Occupy movement in the United States, the General Assembly is seen as the legitimate decision-making body. But when it comes time to enforce a decision that some disagree with, its authority is often called into question. Nearly every significant conflict that has cropped up in Occupy movements around the country rests on the bedrock issues of authority, accountability, representation and legitimacy.\nThe issue is central to the movement's future because authority rests on the notion of legitimacy. In a leaderless movement, who \u2013 if anyone \u2013 gets to call the shots, initiate actions, represent the group, and perhaps most important, hold people accountable by enforcing authority, order and discipline? Exactly how democratic must a people's movement be?\nThese questions of legitimacy and leadership will return in the next several weeks, as the weather warms and brings possible new outside Occupations, and as a presidential campaign heats up in which both major parties, in different ways, will attempt to lay claim to Occupy's rhetoric and message. The Occupy movement has grappled with these questions in very different ways over the last six months, and lessons learned over that time could be key to the movement's success in 2012.\nFor example, an attempt by a group calling itself The 99% Declaration to convene a \u201cNational General Assembly\u201d in Philadelphia on July 4 was rejected by both the Occupy Philly General Assembly and Occupy Wall Street as the event smacked of co-optation by an outside group that allegedly included a former Goldman Sachs executive. The call received some media attention, but suspicions about the organizers, their plan to replicate conventional politics by electing U.S. citizen-only delegates according to congressional districts and an unhinged tirade by a group member, declaring \u201cOWS is a failure and \u2026 a fraud,\u201d drained the idea of any meaningful support.\nMeanwhile, Adbusters, which sparked Occupy Wall Street, issued a \u201ctactical briefing\u201d in late January with #OccupyChicago and the line \u201cMay 1 \u2013 Bring Tent\u201d superimposed over a photo of Chicago police pummeling protesters in 1968. Adbusters is promoting an occupation of the city during the NATO and G8 summits in May. But Adbusters didn\u2019t consult with OccupyChicago or the Coalition Against NATO/G8 War & Poverty Agenda, and that incensed many people.\nSerena Himmelfarb of OccupyChicago told one reporter, \u201cI am excited that Adbusters continues to support OWS, but they acted irresponsibly \u2026 They acted alone, without regard to what\u2019s already being planned here for the summer.\u201d Another organizer wrote, \u201cIf you want to pick a fight with [the police], you should consult those whose name you are using.\u201d In a nod to Adbusters' prominence, Chicago activists swallowed their grumbling because they knew the call could help generate the publicity and crowds they wanted.\nUnlike the people behind the unsuccessful 99% Declaration, Adbusters drew from a deep pool of media attention and activist goodwill to create its own source of legitimacy. It went around the Occupy Chicago General Assembly and put it in the position of having to endorse the call or make it appear that the movement was split \u2013 which the media would have played up.\nNonetheless, the challenge of the homeless for the movement was profound. So-called street people are consummate members of the 99 percent. Their troubled lives are the outcome of decades of public policies calculated to deindustrialize the economy, emaciate cities, ghettoize the poor and minorities, and shred the safety net. But in Occupy camps all across the country the same split emerged between those who felt that the homeless, runaways, train hoppers and itinerants were central to the movement versus those who felt that they drained resources and diverted energy from the task at hand.\nThe debate about homeless people is a microcosm of the movement's continuing debate about the legitimacy of the broader U.S. society: Can we change the existing political structures, or is the system so rotten we need to build a new society from scratch? This conversation pits the reformists, such as those who believe the goal is to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which means working through the established order, against revolutionaries who want to transform society, which means putting the most marginalized sectors at the center of the struggle.\nThis brings up the fourth case: the movement's faction known as the black bloc. This debate has been going on since black-clad anarchists smashed the windows of chain stores in Seattle in November 1999. This was a sideshow to the huge protests that nonviolently shut down the World Trade Organization ministerial and launched the anti-globalization movement. Black bloc proponents argue that legal protest is so neutered of effectiveness that illegal actions like disruptive street confrontations and property destruction are necessary but still within the bounds of nonviolence as they will not hurt another living being. To no one\u2019s surprise, the conflicting positions on the black bloc are more about one's views about changing the system from within than specific tactics.\nEnter Chris Hedges, who fanned the smoldering debate into a conflagration with his essay \u201cThe Cancer in Occupy.\u201d He took the black bloc to task after a disastrous attempt to occupy an unused convention center in Oakland on Jan. 28 ended in petty vandalism inside City Hall and 400 arrests. Hedges depicts the black bloc as a disease that would consume the movement if left unchecked. Hence, it must be excised down to the last black-hoodie wearing, circle-A flag-waving masked cell.\nAs a prominent journalist, Hedges positions himself as the representative of the movement by decreeing who should be excluded. He illustrated how the media has been the best friend and worst enemy of Occupy. A movement can\u2019t live on Facebook, Twitter and Google alone. It\u2019s the despised corporate media that made OWS a star, and this attention comes with a price. While there is no reason for the Occupy movement to embrace messaging, polls, talking points, focus groups and the other marketing tools of the heavyweight but feeble liberal groups, all sectors need to be aware that those who act in its name have the power to damage it. An idea that sounds great in a General Assembly and looks justified from the vantage point of protesters may appear absurd, chaotic and violent when refracted through the camera eye. That\u2019s precisely what happened in Oakland on that fateful day where representation and accountability were as much part of the street battle as tear-gas projectiles and plastic shields.\nDavid Graeber justifiably dressed down Hedges for failing to explain that as the black bloc is a tactic, not an anarchist grouping, it crosses the left\u2019s rambling spectrum. Moreover, Graeber corrected the former New York Times correspondent\u2019s record by noting that far from being a destructive fringe, proponents of black bloc tactics have been elbow deep in organizing Occupy Wall Street from the beginning.\nHowever, even if the legitimacy question is solved, it leaves unaddressed issues of representation and accountability. A former black blocker who lives in Portland, Ore., explained it\u2019s a predicament when any group organizes in secret, and takes actions in the name of the movement but without any transparent mechanism for accountability. Self-selecting \u201caffinity groups\u201d take actions under the Occupy umbrella, but accountability is largely based on informal social networks, moral suasion and pressure.\nIn a movement like Occupy, which is more like a cosmic haze of subatomic particles than a luminous celestial body, democracy is fuzzy. Democracy is not \u201ceveryone does what everyone wants to,\u201d says Bratsis. And that is the heart of the matter. Some people want to drum. Others want to toke up or shoot up. Some want to work within the system. Others want to fight the state. And these actions all impinge on other people\u2019s rights or visions of the movement.\nConsensus \u2013 the lifeblood of the General Assembly which is the beating heart of the Occupy movement \u2013 is about getting everyone to agree. This sidelines legitimacy. Referencing the philosopher Max Weber, Bratsis says \u201clegitimacy refers to seeking a probability that a command will be obeyed.\u201d In consensus, however, if everyone agrees, there is no need to issue a command. In the few instances where a crisis must be resolved, it is exceedingly laborious to issue a command, which promptly gets ignored as proved by rogue drummers and pot smokers. The state has riot police, jails, courts and armies. The Occupy movement has downward twinkling fingers, and so it ends up using other social and psychological methods to elicit compliance.\nThe 99 percent is a great slogan, but even in a best-case scenario, there will be winners and losers whenever a decision is made. Progress requires democratic mechanisms of legitimacy and accountability and an awareness of who represents the movement and how to represent it. But that can be easier said than done, as the fragmented history of the American left shows.\nIt would be easy for radicals and reformers to part ways, which is already happening from Philadelphia to Southern California. The tougher part is making the 99 percent more than a slogan and creating new systems of democratic power in which everyone is invested. This will determine if the Occupy movement is a flash in the pan or the dawn of a new era.\nArun Gupta, a New York writer and co-founder of Occupy the Wall Street Journal, covers the Occupy movement for Salon.", "\u201cDon\u2019t come back,\u201d was the last thing I heard as I walked out of Stanford SJP\u2019s (Students for Justice in Palestine) \u201cTears of Gaza\u201d screening recently. The reason for this enmity directed at me? I asked two questions.\nI did not phrase my questions antagonistically. I did not criticize the director. During the Q&A, I asked the director: (1) Did she document footage of Hamas exploiting Palestinian citizens\u2019 suffering as a tool to bolster international hatred against Israel? (2) Did she observe the actions by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) to save Palestinian lives throughout the ongoing war?\nThe film neglects to show Hamas\u2019s use of Palestinians as human shields to protect terrorists from rocket fire in civilian centers. It also fails to show that before each of its air raids, the IDF dropped leaflets in Gaza to warn Palestinians of impending danger, and urged them to move away from targeted areas. Nor did it show some of the 180,000 Palestinian citizens \u2013 30 percent of whom are children \u2013 that have received care from Israeli hospitals, and the programs created by Israeli physicians to train Palestinian doctors. The audience does not learn that Hamas hijacks the humanitarian aid meant to be distributed to the Palestinian population for its own organization, namely for the production of terror tunnels and ammunition instead of the construction of infrastructures like schools, mosques and hospitals.\nSome people in the film characterize the \u201ceconomic blockade\u201d as a deliberate tactic by Israel to inflict widespread suffering and collective punishment on the Palestinian citizenry. In reality, the blockade was and remains a security mechanism to defend the Israeli people against both the acquisition of firearms by Hamas and suicide bombers who find refuge in Gaza.\nMoreover, by not mentioning Hamas, the terrorist organization that simultaneously serves as the government in Gaza, \u201cTears of Gaza\u201d portrays the war as Israel versus the Palestinian people. If a movie described WWII as the U.S. versus the German people, and neglected to mention the Nazis, I would also stand up and question why the context was ignored. By the same token, when SJP and SOOP alienate Israel, they disregard that the war in Gaza is not a war against a people, but a war against a terrorist government, Hamas, that inflicts equal \u2013 if not worse \u2013 harm on its own citizens.\nWhen I tried to bring context to the conflict as portrayed by \u201cTears of Gaza,\u201d I was stared down by SJP supporters, peers and faculty members in attendance, and told, \u201cdon\u2019t come back.\u201d I was ostracized and made to feel highly uncomfortable.\nI am discouraged to know that I am not the only student who has felt silenced and marginalized by SJP; as a result, many students are afraid to speak up about similar personal interactions. The stories that I have heard and continue to hear concerning the divisiveness of SJP and SOOP events hosted in the wake of the ASSU divestment bill vote illustrate the strident climate and vitriol on campus that it breeds. Sadly, this has been the experience of students on other college campuses as well.\nWhen students decide that their mission is so blindly committed to a cause that they do not make an attempt to present Israel\u2019s rationale, they are the creators and propagators of harmful one-sided rhetoric. As perpetrators of this hurtful propaganda, they are not the vanguard of the solution, but rather an integral part of the problem. And when they go so far as to create and condone an environment that is hostile to and suppressive of intellectual inquiry and debate, they are violating Stanford\u2019s mission to facilitate the free exchange of ideas and respect for diversity.\nUltimately, information without context is the root cause of the polarization between the two camps of beliefs on this campus, those against divestment and those for it. Information is malleable; when treated like a narrative, it changes the kinds of questions that you ask and the kinds of conclusions that you extrapolate. A one-sided narrative prescribes you to judgments that are highly misguided and offensive to many among our Stanford community.\nContact Sophie Schulman at soschul \u2018at\u2019 stanford.edu.", "It seems that Facebook\u2019s biggest threat these days isn\u2019t necessarily Google + but itself.\nAccording to the 2011 American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) e-business report, the social network is the least-loved major website on the Internet.\nThe annual study, founded at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business and published in partnership with analytics firm Foresee Results, tracks customer satisfaction across three categories of e-business: social media, portals and search engines, and online news. This year\u2019s report, released today, is the twelfth of its kind.\nWhile Facebook\u2019s score increased 3 percent (from 64 percent last year to 66 percent this year), it still came in last in the social media category and in the overall index.\nWith a score of 78 percent, Wikipedia topped the social media category, followed by YouTube at 74 percent. According to the study, MySpace dropped off the index because it doesn\u2019t have enough users for a statistically significant sample.\nThe survey took place in June, before the launch of Google+ but ACSI said Facebook\u2019s low score bodes well for the search giant\u2019s new social network.\n\"We don't know yet how Google+ will fare, but what we do know is that Google is one of the highest-scoring companies in the ACSI and Facebook is one of the lowest,\" said Larry Freed, president and CEO of ForeSee Results, in a press release. \"An existing dominance of market share like Facebook has is no longer a safety net for a company that is not providing a superior customer experience.\"\nThe study also said that social media tends to be one of the lowest-scoring industries measured by the ACSI. Airlines, newspapers, and subscription television services are the only industries to score lower, it said.\nIn the search and portal category, Google took the lead with a score of 83 percent, but Bing finished closed behind with 82 percent. Foxnews.com scored highest among news sites with 82 percent and was followed by ABCNews.com at 77 percent.", "Richard Branson is sizing up a possible bid for the Great Western high-speed rail franchise as part of a move to recreate British Rail's former InterCity express train network under the Virgin colours.\nVirgin already operates the Cross Country and West Coast high-speed passenger franchises and is waiting to hear from the Government's rail supremo Sir Alastair Morton whether it can bid for East Coast. Successful bids for East Coast and Great Western, which serves the South West and South Wales from Paddington station, would give Virgin the vast bulk of the former Inter-City routes.\nIf Virgin takes over the franchise it would aim to operate a fleet of tilting diesel trains capable of 140mph or more on the straight, fast stretches of the route between London and Bristol. However, it does not propose to carry out the long-awaited electrification of the 300-mile route as part of its bid package.\nThe InterCity name, which is seen as one of the most successful brands developed by the public sector, died after privatisation when its network was broken up into six franchises. It was highly profitable during the late Eighties boom and some industry experts - including many at Virgin - believed it should have been sold as a stand-alone business.\nBritish rail authorities said they had chosen the first companies to compete for three of the country's rail franchises, including one of the two main routes from London to Scotland. The current operators were among those shortlisted by the government's Shadow Strategic Rail Authority. The companies have 60 days to submit detailed proposals to the SSRA, which will select those to go forward for final negotiations.\n'It is expected that the replacement franchises will be determined in the spring and become effective in the second half of the year,' it said.\nSea Containers' Great North Eastern Railway will have to compete with a bid from Virgin Rail Group in conjunction with Stagecoach Holdings Plc for the east coast line to Scotland.\nThe authority said Virgin/Stagecoach would need to show they had the resources to manage this franchise in addition to their current west coast route to Scotland.\nSSRA Chief Executive Mike Grant said they would also need to show that it was 'in the interests of passengers that the two major London to Scotland franchises should be in the hands of a single franchisee'.", "In the storm of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d that raged on U.S. airwaves in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, one of the most persistent scenarios envisioned terrorists smuggling a weapon of mass destruction into the U.S. in one of the approximately 5.7 million sea containers processed by the U.S. Customs Service each year.\nThis scenario was so gut-wrenchingly plausible that, to guard against it, Customs instituted the Container Security Initiative (CSI) in January 2002.\nIn the 18 months since the Sept. 11 attacks, CSI and newer regulations from Customs have shaken the dust off a labor intensive and technologically lax shipping industry, forcing major changes in the way ocean carriers and their customers do business.\nOcean carriers, freight forwarders and logistics firms are responding to the changing regulatory environment with technology, including desktop applications and Web portals.\nThe question remains, however, whether the short-term pain of tightened security will turn into long-term gain for shippers and their customers, transforming a technologically moribund ocean shipping industry, or whether it will add complexity to an industry dominated by differing priorities of nations.\nBy all accounts, the oceanic transportation industry was in need of modernization.\nWith paper transactions still common, the industry in many ways ran the same way in 2001 as it had for generations, said John Little, compliance director of freight forwarder The Elite Group Inc. in Houston.\n\u201cJust as an example, I was up in Salem (Massachusetts), visiting the Customs House and there were documents there from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s time. I could look at those documents and they were very recognizable today, 150 years later,\u201d Little said.\nDomestic security was not even a primary concern of Customs, which was historically focused on collecting tariffs and thwarting illegal traffickers, said Patricia McCauley, director of container security initiatives at Customs.\n\u201cPre-9/11, nobody paid much attention to container security,\u201d said Gordon Fuller, director for eBusiness at Covansys Corp., a technology services company based in Farmington Hills, Michigan.\nIn particular, lax regulations governed how and when information on a ship\u2019s cargo, the \u201cmanifest,\u201d was relayed from the shipping line to Customs. Documentation supplied to ocean carriers by importers or their overseas export agents, known as the \u201cbill of lading,\u201d was often cursory.\nParties sending and receiving goods were not named or that information was not accurate. Goods were frequently described using customary designations such as \u201cFAK,\u201d standing for \u201cfreight of all kinds,\u201d or \u201cgeneral department store merchandise,\u201d Fuller said.\nExporters did not have to relay information on what was in a container until after it was loaded onto a ship, and the ship\u2019s manifest could be forwarded to Customs up to two weeks after the vessel left port, said Robin Kirby, director of business systems design at Oakland, California-based company APL Ltd.\n\u201cAt a basic level, we wouldn\u2019t get complete information on the shipper and consignee, the buyer and seller. You might get a name, but not an address, or a bank (might be) listed as the consignee,\u201d Kirby said.\nMaking matters worse, bill of lading information was used by shipping companies to build their own vessel cargo lists, making those documents inaccurate. Bill of lading information might also be given to others in the supply chain, such as freight forwarders, customs house brokers and third-party logistics companies, said John Urban, president of Alameda, California-based GT Nexus Inc., a shipping industry Web portal.\nTight supply-chain integration and the requirement to share information meant mistakes were often passed from party to party, he said.\nThe introduction of new Customs regulations, including CSI, put pressure on companies to clean up their operations, according to one industry analyst. In particular, CSI instituted tough new reporting requirements that require shippers to have detailed descriptions of exactly what goods they ship, as well as names of the sender and recipient.\nCustoms also pushed importers, freight forwarders and ocean carriers to provide more information on what they were transporting and to provide that information earlier than before, adopting electronic standards for information exchange to speed the process.\nOther regulations have also prodded the shipping industry to change.\nCustoms\u2019 Advance Manifest Regulation, which is separate from CSI, requires shippers and ocean carriers to electronically submit complete container manifests through Customs\u2019 Automated Manifest System (AMS) 24 hours before a container is loaded onto a vessel.\nAlso known as the \u201c24-hour rule,\u201d the Advanced Manifest Regulation has mandated electronic information exchange in an industry that, until recently, was driven by phone, fax and courier-based communication, Urban said.\nResponding to the new regulations, APL and other carriers are encouraging shippers to submit documents electronically, using desktop-based applications and company-run Web portals that provide interfaces for submitting information.\nAPL\u2019s portal, HomePort, enables shippers to request bookings online, submit bill of lading instructions and create custom reports based on their shipping data.\nGetting its customers to use HomePort or direct Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) links to its back-end systems allows APL to process orders more quickly, feeding shipping instructions directly into the company\u2019s core systems without requiring staff to manually key in the information, Kirby said.\nMajor ocean carriers have also partnered with each other to host business-to-business (B-to-B) Web portals that give shippers the ability to submit documents to a wide range of shipping companies from one location.\nOne B-to-B portal, GTN, is backed by a consortium of European, Asian and North American ocean carriers, including APL, representing more than 40 percent of the global market for container shipping.\nBuilt on a Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) platform, using software from BEA Systems Inc.\u2019s WebLogic and Vitria Technology Inc.\u2019s BPM (business process management) in addition to proprietary technology from GT Nexus, GTN\u2019s Web-based front-end links directly into each carrier\u2019s back-end proprietary system.", "A taxi driver pauses in his vehicle on September 4, 2012 in New York City.\nFor people who live in cities like San Francisco and New York, this era of on-demand transportation wars can be a fantastic time to take a regular old cab. That\u2019s especially true because of apps like Flywheel and Arro\u2014the latter launching in New York City on Wednesday\u2014which allow riders to summon taxis from their smartphones and pay through the app just like they do when taking an Uber or Lyft.\nUber is fond of pointing out that its UberX service is cheaper than a cab. And that goes doubly for its UberPOOL option, which allows riders to get cheaper fares for sharing rides with strangers traveling in the same general direction. A trip from downtown San Francisco to the airport could be half the price via UberPOOL compared to what it is in a cab, saving a rider a solid $25.\nBut surge pricing, Uber\u2019s practice of temporarily upping rates in times of high demand or low supply, requires a big asterisk on the company\u2019s cheaper-than-thou talk. Right after work or on those late weekend nights, the rates for an UberX driver can quickly double or triple. And that probably means that taking a never-surging cab is now the cheapest option, even with a 20% tip factored in.\nThe size of these bars will vary from city to city and company to company, but cabs remain competitively priced. And apps that summon them are worth having in one\u2019s tool belt, if only so your wallet is not beholden to how many Uber drivers decided to go to work that day.\nIf cab drivers in the Bay Area are any indication, these workers have never been more grateful for a fare. Taxis became notorious for providing terrible service in part because they could get away with it in times of yore. Riders had nowhere else to turn. But the competition from Lyft and Uber drivers\u2014with their polite salutations and Starburst candy and free bottles of water\u2014has shamed many taxi drivers into upping their customer-service game. Taxis in San Francisco are lousy with \u201cHow are you?\u201d\u2019s and \u201cWhich route would you prefer?\u201d\u2019s and \u201cHave a wonderful night\u201d\u2019s.\nApps like Flywheel also inspire better service because taxi drivers are held accountable through a five-star rating system, just like they are in the Uber and Lyft apps. Bad ratings get investigated. Bad drivers get suspended. Apps allow for feedback and customer input.\nEither way, they\u2019re likely to listen. Access to this much-needed lifeline in the Age of Uber isn\u2019t something many are willing to risk.\nPolls have found that young people are more supportive of and familiar with Uber. At those times when this heavy-using demographic is likely to be summoning cars\u2014like after partying on a Friday night or heading to work in the morning\u2014cabs can be relatively easy to come by. In San Francisco, it\u2019s not uncommon to open an Uber app and find that the closest available driver is seven minutes away at a peak time, while the closest cab is just two minutes off.\nThe hegemony and popularity of Uber is so great in the Bay Area that many young people aren\u2019t even aware that Flywheel exists, even though it\u2019s in more than 80% of the city\u2019s cabs and has been live for more than two years. At the most recent Crunchies (a sort of Oscars celebration for startups) the first joke to fall flat from actor T.J. Miller was about the relatively unpopular and buggy ride-hailing app Curb, which began as a taxi-hailing app. He took a jab at them and was greeted with silence. Few in the highly attuned room\u2014who had all strolled past anti-Uber protestors outside\u2014seemed to be aware that such a thing existed. For now at least, that means more supply for the rest of us.\nUntil July, it was illegal for Uber or Lyft to pick up passengers at Los Angeles\u2019 LAX airport. When city officials voted to change that, Los Angeles became the largest U.S. city allowing full airport access for such companies. Yet even then, officials estmated that it would take months for those drivers to comply with all the rules about processes and fees that these highly regulated depots have in place. The month before, New York City seized nearly 500 Uber cars because drivers were taking illegal pickups, like disallowed street-hails and rides from JFK airport.\nThough rules will likely change as these growing companies continue to lobby airport and city commissioners, for now cabs can get preferential treatment in big cities\u2014whether that\u2019s the ability to work airplane hubs or use special lanes on city thoroughfares. Against \u201cUber outcry,\u201d San Francisco decided this summer to limit private-car traffic on its main artery, Market Street, leading news outlets to predict better service was in store for taxi customers.\nPart of the reason Uber is able to lure hundreds of thousands of new drivers to its platform worldwide every month is the low barrier to entry. It\u2019s easy to sign up, and people can work whenever they feel like it, with no previous driving experience or formal training. In a white paper put out earlier this year, Uber surveyed its drivers and found that some were students, others were retired, others were stay-at-home parents. About 20% came to the job from somewhere in transportation services. But just over half, 51%, had never previously worked as a driver.\nOf course, any individual taxi driver could still be rude, slow and expensive compared to the next new-economy driver on the block. But now is not the time to write off taxis or to forget that they\u2019ll be rolling by\u2014available via app\u2014as you stare down at your phone, waiting for your Uber.", "FCC insists that US can do better, with 10 percent still lacking access.\n\"Seems fast enough to me.\"\nBroadband industry trade groups are hopping mad about a government report that says fast Internet service isn't being deployed to Americans quickly enough.\nThe Federal Communications Commission is required by Congress to determine annually whether broadband \"is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion\" and to take action to encourage deployment if the answer is negative. The FCC's latest report finds that access to broadband\u2014defined as 25Mbps downstream and 3Mbps upstream\u2014has improved significantly but still isn't reaching the whole country.\nThat's not what Internet service providers wanted to hear.\n\u201cDespite the significant, year-over-year advances in broadband capabilities underscored in the Commission\u2019s own data, the conclusions of the FCC\u2019s [Broadband Progress] Report continue an alarming trend of ignoring objectivity and facts in order to serve political ends and maximize agency power,\" the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) said today. The NCTA represents Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and many other cable companies.\nThe FCC says its conclusion is easily backed up by data. Since the latest data shows 10 percent of Americans live in areas where they can't buy home Internet service at broadband speeds, it's clear that broadband isn't being deployed to all Americans as the law requires, the commission says. The problem is even worse in rural areas and tribal lands, where about 40 percent lack access.\nBroadband shortages helped justify an FCC decision to preempt state laws that limit municipal Internet projects last year. By again concluding that broadband isn't being deployed fast enough, the FCC may be paving the way for further actions.\nUSTelecom, a trade group that represents telcos of all sizes including AT&T and Verizon, also blasted the FCC for its latest broadband report.\nAT&T claimed that \"the FCC keeps moving the goal posts on their definition of broadband, apparently so they can continue to justify intervening in obviously competitive markets.\"\nThe FCC found that 20 percent of Americans could not buy 25Mbps/3Mbps broadband in 2012. That number dropped to 10 percent by the end of 2014, and that 10 percent represents 34 million Americans.\nBoth USTelecom and NCTA pointed out that another FCC report released December 30 found that ISPs are generally delivering the speeds they advertise.\nThe findings of the two reports don't conflict, however. The first measured whether Internet providers deliver the speeds they advertise, and the second determined whether fast Internet speeds are being deployed to all Americans.\nConsumer advocacy group Public Knowledge agreed with the FCC's conclusion.\n\"The Report looked at hard evidence and declines to \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 carriers\u2019 claims of accessibility,\" Public Knowledge Staff Attorney Meredith Rose said. \"This finding, and the data gathered for it, will allow policymakers to take an honest look at the broadband landscape and what needs to be done to ensure that all Americans have access to the quality broadband we need to ensure our digital future.\"\nThe FCC will vote January 28 on whether to issue the report as currently written.", "The White House's self-proclaimed \"infrastructure week\" has generated a flurry of headlines on nearly everything else.\nPart of the reason the initiative was overshadowed was ex-FBI Director James Comey's gripping testimony on Capitol Hill, which commanded the attention of Washington and major cable news networks all week.\nBut much of the derailment on the infrastructure rollout has been of President Trump's own making. He repeatedly veered off message in tweets and during infrastructure-themed speeches, flouting some of White House staffers\u2019 carefully laid plans.\n\u201cThey tried really hard, and certainly several people inside care deeply about this,\u201d said Marcia Hale, president of Building America\u2019s Future, who worked under the Clinton administration.\nThe White House launched a weeklong infrastructure initiative designed to ramp up support for Trump\u2019s $1 trillion rebuilding proposal, which has yet to be fully released but remains a top priority for the president.\nThe administration has been under increasing pressure to show progress on the package, especially as officials seek to move past Comey\u2019s abrupt firing and the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nAides plotted out a string of high-profile events to draw attention to different components of Trump\u2019s plan, ranging from waterways and airports to roads and bridges.\nDuring a press call announcing infrastructure week, White House officials sounded hopeful that they could build the consensus needed to move the proposal through Congress.\nBut hours before the infrastructure event kicked off at the White House on Monday, Trump fired off a series of tweets that blamed his Justice Department for writing a second \u201cwatered down\u201d version of his travel ban, labeled Democrats as \u201cobstructionists,\u201d and slammed London\u2019s mayor following a terrorist attack in the city.\nBy the time Trump unveiled plans to modernize air traffic control in the East Room at 11:30 a.m., the main narrative dominating the news cycle centered on the various feuds Trump had ignited on social media.\nAnd when Trump rolled out his aviation announcement, he first spent several minutes discussing unrelated news that the Department of Veterans Affairs will be overhauling its electronic health record system.\n\u201cBefore discussing our plans to modernize air travel, I want to provide an update on efforts to fix and modernize vital services for our veterans,\u201d Trump said, standing in front of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and other former Transportation secretaries.\nInfrastructure has long been billed as one of the few issues that could receive broad bipartisan support this Congress.\nBut Trump\u2019s call to separate air traffic control from the federal government is one of his more controversial infrastructure proposals, and quickly earned a stinging rebuke from Democrats at the start of the week.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s \u2018infrastructure week\u2019 appears to be little more than a Trojan Horse for undermining workers\u2019 wages and handing massive tax breaks to billionaires and corporations,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\nTrump continued with early-morning tweets on Tuesday and Wednesday that set off new firestorms: taking credit for four Arab countries\u2019 decision to cut ties with Qatar and announcing his pick for FBI director.\nMidweek, Trump was slated to continue his infrastructure pitch with a speech in Ohio aimed at emphasizing inland waterways' important role in transporting steel, coal, corn and other goods.\nBut slipped into the schedule, just 30 minutes before Trump\u2019s rebuilding remarks, was a surprise speech on healthcare.\nAnd when it came time for his infrastructure speech, Trump spent part of it assailing ObamaCare and Democrats, appearing to veer off script at several points.\nThe same day, the administration dispatched Chao to Capitol Hill to sell lawmakers on Trump\u2019s air traffic control proposal. But the idea received a brutal reception from both sides of the aisle, with rural Republicans excoriating the plan.\n\u201cThis is a tough sell in states like my state of Mississippi, where small airports are very concerned about where this will leave them, and I think we\u2019re going to see this on both sides of the aisle,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).\nThe spinoff proposal was more warmly received in the House the next day, but that hearing was completely overshadowed by Comey\u2019s dramatic testimony.\nBut the rebuilding effort has almost seemed like an afterthought, with the concept of \u201cinfrastructure week\u201d becoming somewhat of a punch line on Capitol Hill.\n\u201cI think this is the most exciting hearing of the day on Capitol Hill, for the record,\u201d joked Rep.

But he overestimates both India\u2019s desire to improve the relationship and the benefits doing so would bring.\nLike many advocates of stronger U.S.-Indian ties, Burns fails to recognize that two countries with the same system of government do not necessarily develop similar interests or policies. In the case of India, the burdens of colonialism and economic underdevelopment have led it to oppose much of the U.S. agenda. Like China, India continues to view the United States as a presumptuous superpower and competitor. And if India realizes its goal of becoming an economic powerhouse with global influence, New Delhi\u2019s rivalry with Washington, particularly in South Asia, will likely intensify.\nAlthough Burns writes that \u201cthe United States and India should continue to strengthen their defense and political coordination in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d he neglects to mention that India appears uninterested in cooperating on this front. The United States has included India in multilateral strategic discussions on the Asia-Pacific region, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, with Australia and Japan, which sought to respond to increased Chinese power, but India has not made such meetings a priority. New Delhi has also been conspicuously absent from the two combined naval task forces the United States assembled to combat terrorism and piracy in the Indian Ocean.

Written in English by Joshua Lipes.", "Turkey and the US have agreed on the outlines of a plan to drive Islamic State out of a strip of land along the Turkish-Syrian border, according to reports, in a landmark deal that will draw Turkey further into Syria\u2019s civil war and looks likely to increase the intensity of the US air war against Isis.\nThe agreement to create an \u201cIslamic State-free zone\u201d, as officials are calling it, comes days after a wave of violence linked to the Syrian conflict prompted Turkey, a Nato member, to launch air strikes for the first time against Isis and allow a coalition led by the US to use its airbases to bomb militant targets in Syria.\nIt is a diplomatic victory for Turkey, which has long demanded the creation of a safe haven in northern Syria, across the 500-mile (800km) border that links the two countries, as a precondition for joining the battle against Isis.\nAmerican officials told the New York Times they had agreed to work with Turkey and Syrian rebel fighters to clear a 60-mile strip of land near the border that would constitute a safe haven for Syrian refugees. Turkey hosts about 1.8 million displaced people who fled the civil war.\nBut it remains unclear how the safe haven will be policed, whether it will have to include a de facto no-fly zone patrolled by coalition planes, and what the response will be if troops loyal to the regime of the embattled Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, attack American allies including the Kurdish militias (YPG) and Syrian opposition fighters battling Isis in northern Syria.\nIt is also not clear how the safe haven will affect the Kurds. US warplanes have spent months over Syrian skies bombing Isis to help the Kurds take the fight to the militants. But Ankara is worried that the successes of the Kurds across the border will fire up separatists at home, with whom it has fought a 30-year civil war, and has launched a crackdown on the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK), which has links to the YPG\u2019s political arm, the Democratic Union party (PYD).\nOn Monday, the YPG accused Turkey of targeting its fighters inside Syria as they laid siege to Isis-held positions close to another key border crossing, the town of Jarabulus. In a statement, the YPG said Turkey had shelled a Kurd and opposition-held town near the border with seven tank rounds, and that an hour later it had attacked vehicles belonging to the Kurdish militia.\nTurkey has also arrested hundreds of alleged Isis and PKK members in the past few days, in retaliation for a suicide bombing earlier this month in the southern town of Suru\u00e7, a cross-border attack by Isis militants that killed a Turkish soldier, and violence against local police by PKK militants.\nThe crackdown sparked violent demonstrations in Istanbul in which a policeman was killed. Attacks on police and army posts were reported in some cities in the predominantly Kurdish south-east. Kurdish politicians have accused the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, of \u201csetting the country on fire\u201d as a prelude to calling a snap election, in a bid to reverse his party\u2019s losses in last month\u2019s polls.\nTurkey\u2019s acting prime minister, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, has said military operations against the PKK and Isis would continue as long as the country faced a threat from either group. Speaking during a working dinner with several Turkish newspaper editors on Saturday, he said the military operations had \u201cchanged the regional game\u201d and \u201cshowed its [Turkey\u2019s] strength\u201d.\nThe PKK announced on Sunday that three of its members were killed, while seven others were wounded, in the second wave of air strikes and artillery attacks on the Qandil mountain, where the Kurdish group\u2019s military headquarters is based.\nThe campaign against the PKK throws into question the future of the already very fragile peace process, started in 2012 in an effort to end the bloody conflict between the Turkish state and the Kurdish rebels, which has resulted in the deaths of more than 40,000 people. It also poses questions about the aims of Turkey\u2019s escalation, with more force directed at the PKK than against Isis.", "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Soon after coach Matt Rhule received the obligatory drenching on the sideline, confetti rained down on the Temple football team and the players jumped with excitement during a celebration that was nearly five decades in the making.\nFor the first time since 1967, the Owls are league champions.\nPhillip Walker threw two touchdown passes, Temple's defense stuffed Navy's running game and the Owls claimed their first American Athletic Conference title with a 34-10 victory Saturday.\nAfter Temple (10-3) scored touchdowns on its first three possessions, protecting the 21-0 lead became substantially easier when No. 20 Navy (9-3, No. 19 CFP) lost standout quarterback Will Worth to a second-quarter ankle injury.\nNavy coach Ken Niumatalolo said Worth is done for the season, along with running backs Toneo Gulley and Darryl Bonner, both of whom left with first-half injuries.\nThe Owls extended their winning streak to seven and earned their first league title since finishing atop the Middle American Conference some 49 seasons ago.\n\"If it means one thing, it means a promise has been fulfilled,\" said Rhule, who vowed to build a winner at Temple despite going 2-10 in 2013, his first season. \"The true thing for me about this is just to have these players to be able to call themselves champions. When you win this conference, you've done something special.\"\nTemple lost to Houston in last year's AAC Championship game. This time, the Owls dominated from the outset.\n\"It showed we have a really good team that is capable of doing a lot of good things,\" said Walker, who went 16 for 25 for 199 yards.\nNot only did Temple open with TD drives of 75, 59 and 70 yards, but the defense quashed a Navy attack that was averaging 61 points over its previous three games.\n\"They just played better. It wasn't a magic wand,\" Niumatalolo said. \"They just hit us in the mouth and we hadn't been hit in the mouth for a long time. Normally, we hit other people in the mouth. To Temple's credit, they hit us in the mouth. We were dazed the whole game. It's like they hit us with an overhand right.\"\nThe Midshipmen had scored on 34 of 38 drives \u2014 including 33 touchdowns \u2014 before being denied on their first three possessions by Temple. Worth was injured at the end of the third drive and did not return.\nThat spelled doom for an offense that produced more than 500 yards in each of its last three games. Navy finished with 306 yards, 168 on the ground.\nBackup quarterback Zach Abey went 7 for 13 for 104 yards and two interceptions.\n\"I missed some reads, wish I had some plays back,\" he said.\nThe result was the end of Navy's 15-game home winning streak.\nMiddle linebacker Jarred Alwan led the Owls defense with 13 tackles, and Sean Chandler contributed eight tackles and forced a fumble.\nTemple took the suspense out of the game with an early show of offensive firepower. After Walker completed a 13-yard pass for Keith Kirkwood on fourth-and-7 from the Navy 28, Jahad Thomas ran for a 15-yard score.\nA 22-yard touchdown pass to Ventell Bryant made it 14-0, and Walker followed a Navy turnover with a perfectly thrown long pass that Kirkwood caught in stride for a 56-yard score.\nThe injury to Worth occurred on Navy's next possession.\nRhule believes the Owls should be considered for a major bowl, even though unbeaten Western Michigan is positioned to be the highest-ranked team from the Group of Five conferences when the committee releases its final rankings Sunday.\n\"We've beaten two Top 25 teams this year,\" he said. \"We should be a ranked team. We had three losses early.\"\n\"I'm not saying anything negative about anyone else,\" Rhule stressed, \"but we should be playing on the New Year's Day Six bowl.\"\nTemple: The Owls played exceptionally well in proving to be a worthy conference champion. Even before the injuries to Navy's backfield, Temple's defense successfully tackled the challenge of slowing down Navy's formidable offense.\nNavy: The Midshipmen had it all going for them: Momentum on offense, home-field advantage and the incentive of playing in the Cotton Bowl. But Navy wasn't sharp enough to put a dent in a Temple defense that had allowed a total of 10 points in its previous three games.\nTemple: The Owls expect to learn their bowl destination on Sunday.\nNavy: The annual Army-Navy game will be held in Baltimore on Saturday. The Midshipmen will be looking for their 15th straight win in the series.", "Former Palestinians allegedly prepared bombs to carry out honor killing.\nThree former Palestinians whose families collaborated with Israel were indicted at the Haifa District Court on Thursday on charges of preparing explosive devices and conspiracy to commit a crime. Anan Agbari, 22, Ines Shatiya, 23, and Abdullah Abu Samra, 20, all residents of Haifa, allegedly intended to carry out a so-called family honor killing. Originally, it was suspected that the suspects had planned to use the pipe bombs they had manufactured to carry out a terrorist attack. They were arrested last week at their homes in Haifa's Hadar district, but the case was subject to a court-imposed publicity ban that was only lifted on Thursday when the three were indicted. Dep.-Cmdr. Benni Abalia, head of the Haifa station Criminal Investigations Department, said the matter came to light after a fire in the stairwell of the building where the suspects lived. \"Police went to the scene and found that the fire had been caused by a fuse, connected to a home-made pipe bomb, that had been set alight,\" Abalia told The Jerusalem Post. \"The suspects had been in the process of trying out one of the bombs, but they stamped out the burning fuse at the last minute when they realized that the resulting explosion could bring down the building,\" he said. Subsequent searches of the building revealed three more pipe bombs ready for use. The devices were neutralized by police sappers. The suspects, one of whom himself collaborated with Israel and the other two the sons of collaborators, were relocated with their families from the territories and had been living in Haifa for some time. \"Initially, there was a suspicion that the suspects may have reneged on their former cooperation with Israel and that the incident could be a security matter,\" said Abalia. \"However, they made the bombs in order to [carry out a] hit on a Haifa resident after he broke off his engagement to the sister of one of the suspects. \"They had intended to plant the bombs under the man's car or at his home and innocent people could well have been harmed, as well as their target. Fortunately, the matter came to light beforehand,\" said Abalia.", "Reuters Pictures A Beijing resident watches the spectacle from afar.\nBeijing, Beijing: never has this city made so many headlines. Never have so many reviews of books about it, photos of its landmarks, and tips on where to eat and what to see if you go there shown up in English-language publications. If the Olympic Games accomplish nothing else, they will at least ensure that news broadcasters around the world can all find Beijing on a map and pronounce its name correctly, so that references to the anachronistic \u201cPeking\u201d will be consigned to puns in book titles and references to culinary delights, such as the city\u2019s storied duck dish.\nThis explosion of Beijing commentary is natural. And we\u2019ve done our small part to contribute to it, via our individual writings for The China Beat blog and other venues, where we\u2019ve talked up new books with titles like Beijing Time and The Last Days of Old Beijing. Still, as central as Beijing is to the tale of the games, it is a mistake to focus too intently on this one Chinese metropolis. Most of the main news stories relating to the games\u2013from how China got the nod to host, to the event\u2019s political and economic dimensions\u2013are better appreciated when viewed through a multi-city or national lens than solely through the prism of Beijing.\nThe most important reason to look beyond Beijing is simple: the Chinese regime realized from the start that domestically, the games cannot achieve what it wants them to achieve if they are seen as a just the capital\u2019s affair. It has thus taken many steps to encourage people living far from Beijing\u2013who often view the capital and its residents with suspicion\u2013to feel that they, too, have a stake in and can benefit from the Olympics. Consider the torch relay. International audiences tended to lose interest in it after the flame reached China, perking up again only when it made it to Tibet and then this week the capital, but its passage through Hainan Island and cities such as Fujian and provinces such as Anhui\u2013none of which is near Beijing or Lhasa\u2013were crucial for a government that is constantly trying to convince a population with no faith in its official ideology to give it credit for providing attractive bread and circuses at home and for raising China\u2019s profile abroad.\nSince most foreign journalists are based in Beijing, people-in-the-street interviews conducted there will be used to assess the domestic success of the games (or lack thereof). But for the Communist Party, what counts just as much as reactions by Beijingers is how the spectacle plays in places like Wuxi and Wenzhou, which we might be tempted to call Peorias with Chinese characteristics, except that the population of the former is almost ten times and the latter almost twenty times that of the Illinois city.\nHere are some specific stories that benefit from looking beyond Beijing.\nWhen IOC members vote on host cities, they typically weigh the merits of a specific metropolis and a specific country. If nations have hosted the games before, the suitability of a particular city may be particularly important. With first-time hosts like China, though, the vote is more of referendum on the country. And while the decision-making of individual IOC voters is shrouded in secrecy, there are good reasons to assume that in 2001, they were influenced by developments in multiple Chinese cities. For example, when Chinese officials claimed they could quickly transform their then dowdy-looking capital, improving its transportation infrastructure and working with international architecture firms to create stunning new buildings, this notion was given added credence by the spectacular way Pudong (East Shanghai) had evolved from a backwater to a glittering showplace during the 1990s. And when these same officials promised that they could deliver increased press freedom, the degree of media openness in Hong Kong in the immediate aftermath of the 1997 handover gave a degree of plausibility to this notion.\nEvents will be taking place in multiple cities. Beijing will get the most action, but competitions will take place elsewhere: yachting in Qingdao, soccer matches in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Shenyang, and equestrian events in Hong Kong. Lest anyone think that these events will still be basically \u201clocal\u201d to Beijing (analogous to some contests at the Atlanta Games being farmed out to other parts of Georgia), note that while Tianjin is a neighbor of the capital and Qinhuangdao is only about 180 miles from it, Shenyang is more than 400 miles to the north, and Hong Kong more than three times that far to the south (further from Beijing than Atlanta is from Manhattan).\nBeijing has gone all out architecturally for the Olympics, with the construction of the Bird\u2019s Nest (National Stadium), the Water Cube (National Aquatics Center) and a fancy new airport terminal. But this monumental urge neither started in Beijing (Shanghai got its urban makeover and a state-of-the-art new airport first), nor is now limited to the capital. Some of the construction money earmarked for the games is being spread around, as lavish new arenas have been built in secondary host cities like Tianjin. And Shanghai\u2019s built environment continues to be transformed, often through the sort of splashy joint ventures of foreign and Chinese architects that are getting so much attention just now in Beijing. Not long after the Bird\u2019s Nest was completed, for example, the World Financial Center in Pudong became the tallest skyscraper on earth.\nMuch has been made of how the symbolic layout of the capital has been altered by the games, and global television broadcasts of the lead-up have continually used spectacular shots of sites that are in or near Beijing, from Tiananmen Square to the Great Wall, to stand for China. Within China itself, though, efforts have been made to use more geographically diffuse symbols and spectacles to represent the nation. Consider, for instance, the mascots for the games, the cuddly fuwa or \u201cFive Friendlies\u201d that have been marketed heavily in China for the past few years. Created to be broadly representative of varied regions and ethnic groups within the nearly continent-size land mass that is the Peoples Republic of China, the bobble-headed imps are featured on all kinds of Olympic paraphernalia (available at Olympic stands erected on city street corners and in empty storefronts across China). They are often shown participating in Olympic events, from diving to badminton to wrestling (our personal favorites include the image of pudgy panda Jingjing, handgun cocked, participating in the pistol-shooting events).\nJingjing is an emblem for Sichuan, the antelope Yingying represents the Tibetan and Xinjiang minorities, and so on. To turn the fuwa\u2018s diversity into a message of saccharine greeting, while suggesting that the country\u2019s people all come together in the capital (a theme likely to be stressed in the Opening Ceremonies as well), the names of the Friendlies spell out \u201cBeijing Welcomes You.\u201d Often mocked on the web and elsewhere, some have said that rather than being representative of positive Chinese attributes the Friendlies have been harbingers of 2008\u2019s bad luck, from Sichuan\u2019s earthquake to the Tibetan unrest.\nOne likely assumption is that when it comes to future high-profile international gatherings, the main Chinese city to benefit or be hurt by how the games play out will be Beijing. This is partly true. There is talk already of the city wanting to host the World Cup soon, and this will likely only come to pass if the games go well.\nHere again, though, there\u2019s a beyond-Beijing angle worth appreciating. The capital has never been the only city in the mix: Shanghai hosted a major summit in October 2001 that brought George W. Bush, among many other leaders, to Pudong, for example; and Kunming was supposed to host a world anthropology conference earlier this year\u2013but the conference was cancelled due partly to official worries about something untoward happening that would affect the games. And where high-profile events are concerned, Beijing will not even be the main Chinese city to focus on during the two years following the end of the games. Why? Because 2010 will be the year of the Shanghai World Expo.\nWorld Expos are still a very big deal in Asia, and this event is billed as the first World\u2019s Fair ever held in the developing world. It is being touted as an \u201cEconomic Olympics\u201d (one more strategy for ensuring that Olympic fever isn\u2019t seen as a purely Beijing thing), and estimated to have the potential of bringing 70 million tourists to Shanghai. One reason residents of cities other than Beijing have a stake in how the games go is that the Olympics will influence the fate of their bids to host future events.\nEfforts to use the games to knit the Chinese nation together appear to have been successful, so far\u2013certainly more successful than efforts to use the events to improve Western views of the regime. The recent leg of the torch run through earthquake-damaged Sichuan, the torch\u2019s final jaunt before arriving in Beijing, was heralded nationwide, its appearance combined with moments of silence in memory of the earthquake\u2019s victims. And in the next week or so, we\u2019ll see further uses of the games to promote national unity. The equestrian events taking place in Hong Kong, for example, could help solidify the former British colony\u2019s incorporation into the PRC.\nBut not all of these attempts to use this international spectacle to further national ends have worked out as planned. For instance, when the torch run\u2019s path was initially announced, it included a stop in Taiwan\u2013between legs in Vietnam and Hong Kong. The plans sparked accusations from Taiwan that China was using the run to prove that Taiwan was part of the PRC and, despite talks that continued through the summer, the torch eventually bypassed Taiwan. Still, on the whole, the domestic lead-up to the games, even in a year marked by natural and social upheavals, has generally benefited China\u2019s leaders.\nForeign media have often focused on Beijing\u2019s negatives, from bristling security to smoggy air to rampant, \u201cChinglish\u201d signage to, most importantly, the lack of improvements in areas such as human rights and freedom of speech. But we should not underestimate the capacity for stunning spectacle and effervescent hospitality in the Northern Capital in the coming weeks to play well to domestic audiences, who are less focused on human rights and dissent than are international viewers, and will hear much less about any protests or government missteps should these occur (though the increasingly assertive Chinese blogosphere won\u2019t let these things pass without some caustic comment, especially if official corruption, still the hot-button issue in China, seems to be involved).\nThe grandeur of the arenas and the ceremonies\u2013and China\u2019s medal count\u2013are what domestic journalists and broadcasts and their target audiences focus on. And, if all goes smoothly in Beijing, that may still be what international audiences remember most about the 2008 games. This won\u2019t necessarily be a good thing for human rights in China: the court is still out as to the long-term impact the games will have on that front, as a case can still be made that despite the crackdowns and high security, there have been some important positive developments under the radar relating to increased room for maneuver by civil society actors due to the media glare. But if the games are seen globally as well as locally as having been a success, this might open doors for a growing international acquaintance with the local characters of at least a few of the Chinese largest cities, as they get the chance to host international spectacles of their own.\nKate Merkel-HessKate Merkel-Hess is the editor of The China Beat: Blogging How the East is Read, a graduate student in modern Chinese history at the University of California, Irvine, and a contributor to the Times Literary Supplement (London).", "DUBLIN, July 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement under which Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. will acquire Allergan's global generic pharmaceuticals business for $40.5 billion. Allergan will receive $33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion in Teva stock. In addition, Allergan retains 50 percent of Teva's future economics from generic lenalidomide (Revlimid\u00ae). The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Allergan and Teva and is strongly supported by the management teams of both companies.\nUnder the agreement, Teva will acquire Allergan's legacy Actavis global generics business, including the U.S. and international generic commercial units, third-party supplier Medis, global generic manufacturing operations, the global generic R&D unit, the international over-the-counter (OTC) commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and some established international brands.\nAllergan will retain its dynamic global branded pharmaceutical and medical aesthetic businesses, as well as its biosimilars development programs and the Anda distribution business.\n\"This transaction will accelerate Allergan's evolution into a branded Growth Pharma leader, enable a sharpened focus on expanding and enhancing our global branded pharmaceutical business and strengthen our financial position to build on our proven track-record of value creation led by effective capital deployment,\" said Brent Saunders, CEO and President of Allergan.\n\"Allergan expects to have 2015 pro forma sales of approximately $15.5 billion, a simplified operating model and a strong position in seven therapeutic areas, including Eye Care, Gastroenterology (GI), Aesthetics, Women's Health, CNS, Urology and Anti-infectives.

What education and training do they need to do their job and be ready to support? The answer can be very complex with the extensive list of duties required for the mission. Even with job descriptions that are straightforward, there is still training - combined with their current job skills and experience -- that will help employees master and perform their tasks in support of AMC and Army priorities.\"\nWith its workforce being 96 percent civilian, AMC is developing the Ready Army Civilian initiative with plans of it eventually being adopted Army wide. AMC Human Resources (G-1) will have a major role in the initiative as it works to implement the initiative among G-1 employees, encourages its implementation to employees throughout headquarters staff sections and helps to oversee its implementation through AMC's major subordinate commands.\n\"Our subordinate commands have been asked to undergo the same analysis we applied in HQ AMC. The entire AMC enterprise is being asked to become more efficient while enhancing our focus on lethality, readiness and modernization. Shape the Fight and Ready Army Civilian are essential in our ability to adapt to and execute current and future requirements for our Soldiers and Department of Defense partners,\" Wyche said.\nThe G-1 mission - to man the force, lead the human capital management program, cultivate and develop talent, oversee the health of the force, and execute the commander's safety and occupational health program - puts it at the forefront of any employee development initiative. AMC's town hall with Lisha Adams, the executive deputy to the AMC commanding general, in late 2018 helped set the stage to ensure employees are trained and equipped to support Soldier readiness.\n\"Ready Army Civilian gets to the heart of (AMC commanding) General (Gus) Perna's goal of having the right workforce doing 100 percent of the work 100 percent of the time,\" Wyche said. \"We're in a stage within our organization where a lot is expected of Army Materiel Command employees while, at the same time, we are transferring some responsibilities and work to the Army Futures Command. There are high expectations of AMC, our workforce and our leaders to take on different roles and tasks, and to maintain a high level of performance while doing so.\"\nWyche expects supervisors within the G-1, and throughout AMC headquarters and its subordinate commands to \"take deliberate actions to ensure our current workforce and future workforce are properly trained and aligned to perform the mission.\"\nSupervisors, he said, must be able to manage high performing teams while also working with employees individually to ensure each has the adequate education, training and experience to do their job. While Shape the Fight allowed the G-1 to better align with its mission to develop and sustain an innovative and responsive human capital framework, and to maximize workforce capabilities and output, Ready Army Civilian defines the requirements of civilians so that solid pathways are clearly set to move the AMC enterprise toward mission accomplishment, he said.\n\"At the end of the day, employee performance must align to mission output,\" Wyche said. \"Ready Army Civilian ensures employees are fully equipped to perform jobs they are in. To do that, supervisors must effectively define requirements and expectations of each job.\"\nJust like Soldiers, Army civilians must be qualified to compete, perform and serve in a way that positively impacts Army readiness. AMC supports this effort by providing policies, guidance and resources needed to build and sustain a high performing workforce.\n\"This is really about, number one, ensuring we are effectively using our resources in terms of people and money. As trusted agents of the Department of Defense and the federal government, we are obligated to do that,\" Wyche said. \"And, number two, forming a workforce that has the tools needed to do their jobs, that has the opportunity and is empowered to perform their mission.\"\nFollowing Perna's guidance to \"think big, start small\" in designing a framework for civilian readiness, AMC G-1 will implement the Ready Army Civilian initiative by first doing an analysis of where employees are in terms of education, training and experience. Supervisors must be able to identify gaps in employee qualifications and training, and then work to fill those gaps.\n\"We want to provide tools to help supervisors assess our current workforce,\" Wyche said. \"We want to help employees assess themselves as well. We want to make sure everybody is effectively postured to perform at a high level in their current position.\"\nThe DOD Performance Management and Appraisal Program and other performance assessment tools, career programs, supervisory support and the Civilian Education System are all key to implementing the Ready Army Civilian initiative.\n\"There are many opportunities for employees who want to grow and be empowered, who want to be high performers. There are several tools for employees and leaders that help them to develop their skills, solve problems, resolve conflicts, communicate better and focus on the mission, all elements of Ready Army Civilian,\" Wyche said.\n\"The issue is that supervisors and employees must determine which training courses are the best for the right kind of output, and then plan on when that training can occur without having an adverse effect on the mission. That's the challenge.\"\nBut, planning for those training opportunities is well worth it in the long run, he said.\n\"When you enhance peoples' ability to perform in a certain position and for the organization, then you have improved civilian readiness and responsiveness to the Army mission,\" Wyche said.\n\"We want employees to be able to perform at top levels. If you take care of employees' education and training needs, you provide a positive and higher performing work environment, and you set a foundation of excellence that affects performance, retention and recruiting.\"", "PRESIDENT of the Jamaica Medical Doctors Association (JMDA) Dr Alfred Dawes said yesterday that doctors should not be blamed for the death of 34-year-old Jason Forbes at the Spanish Town Hospital, St Catherine on Wednesday.\n\"... If you're going to blame anybody, don't just single out doctors and blame doctors, blame the infrastructure, blame the lack of adequate staffing, and blame the patients who are crowding up the emergency room unnecessarily,\" Dr Dawes told the Jamaica Observer yesterday.\nForbes' sister, Carmen Gunn, told the Jamaica Observer on Wednesday that her brother went to the hospital some time after 7:00 pm on Tuesday, complaining about a pain in his stomach. However, it was not until more than 14 hours later, on Wednesday morning, that his name was eventually called, but by then, Gunn said her brother was dead.\nDr Dawes, who was on duty at the health facility on Tuesday night, attempted to shed some light on the situation yesterday.\n\"I worked in surgery but we never got that referral,\" eh said. \"The patient, as you rightly said, was never assessed by the emergency team until he had collapsed.\"\nDr Dawes said the population in St Catherine has tripled since 1972 and that since then, very little improvement has been made to the hospital.\n\"We have seen an influx of patients, an increased caseload since the removal of user fees, patients in general prefer to come to the hospital since they are not paying anything and because they perceive that it is better care that they are getting than at the health centres,\" Dr Dawes told the Observer. \"So we are overwhelmed with patients who are non-urgent, who can be seen at health centres.\"\nDr Dawes, a general surgeon, explained that the triage system is used to determine the priority of patients' treatment, which is dependent on the severity of their conditions.\n\"The triage system operates in such that emergency patients and somebody who has trauma, somebody who has chest pain, somebody with a head injury that's severe, would be priorities,\" he said.. \"The urgent cases are those with the abdominal pain, like this gentleman, and those who have some other cuts, other signs of trauma that can be seen, not on an emergency basis as the first-come-first-serve, but, to put it simply, first-come-second-serve.\n\"These patients are then followed by non-urgent cases which are those with \"fever, rashes, coughs, cold, and people who are abusing the system coming in with their STIs (sexually transmitted infections) and so forth. So, what happened was that there was an influx of emergencies and those kept bumping the urgent cases back so that the doctors on duty in accident and emergency never got a chance to move through the urgent cases as quickly as they would've liked to...,\" Dr Dawes explained.\nHe said this was the reason Forbes, with his abdominal pain, \"was sitting there with dozens of other people with abdominal pain and we couldn't sift through\". By sifting through the doctors would then make a clinical judgement to see who was really an emergency case to get them into the emergency area for urgent attention, Dr Dawes added.\n\"That was not the case with this gentleman because he walked in several hours before, he was not that ill at that time, he deteriorated overnight, unfortunately, but he was never seen on time because we were pretty much overwhelmed,\" said Dr Dawes.\nThe JMDA president also insisted that Forbes' death was not the doctors' fault.\n\"It is pretty much the staffing that was very poor, it is not that the doctors were callous, inconsiderate or made errors in judgement,\" said he said. \"It's just that we could not go through emergencies in a quick enough time to get to the (urgent cases).\"\nHe pointed out that the issue of staffing is nothing new but that it was further compounded by the number of patients who turn up at hospitals instead of seeking medical attention at health centres.\nHe told the Observer that there was an urgent need to \"improve the staffing throughout the health care sector [as] we are overworked and overburdened and we need to educate the public that the health centres are adequately equipped to deal with non-urgent conditions and that is the only way we are going to get persons who really need emergency and urgent medical attention being attended to in a timely manner\".", "The FBI will give the State Department the \u201cseveral thousand\u201d work-related emails that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over to her former employer in 2014.\nThe move, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, paves the way for the State Department to release the former secretary of state\u2019s entire work-related product.\nA State Department spokesman declined to commit to that undertaking in a comment to The Wall Street Journal, but he did say that the agency is working with the FBI to resolve the matter.\n\u201cAs we have said for many months, we will work with the FBI to determine the appropriate disposition of potential federal records it has recovered,\u201d John Kirby, a spokesman for the Department, told The Journal.\nThe news comes hours after Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that she will not pursue charges against Clinton or her aides for mishandling classified information. She also said that the case will be formally closed.\nThat statement followed FBI director James Comey\u2019s surprise announcement on Tuesday that he would be recommending to Lynch that charges not be filed in the case.\nWhile Comey said that Clinton should not be charged, he hammered her over her \u201cextremely careless\u201d email practices.\nDuring a dramatic 15-minute press conference, Comey provided some additional detail about Clinton\u2019s missing emails.\n\u201cThe FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014,\u201d he said.\nIn Dec. 2014, Clinton gave the State Department roughly 30,000 emails that her lawyers determined were work-related. Another 30,000 were deemed personal and deleted.\nClinton has claimed that her lawyers were \u201cover-inclusive\u201d by handing over around 1,000 emails that the State Department determined were not related to government business. That claim was greatly undermined by Comey\u2019s announcement that \u201cseveral thousand\u201d missing emails were work-related.\n\u201cSome had been deleted over the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected to the private email domain,\u201d Comey explained on Tuesday.\nOthers were retrieved from archived government email accounts of people who emailed with Clinton. Another tranche of emails was found after a \u201claborious review\u201d of millions of email fragments \u201cdumped into the slack space\u201d of Clintons\u2019 server, said Comey.\nThe Obama appointee provided little detail about the contents of the missing emails. He did say that three contained information that was classified at the time they were sent or received. One had \u201cSecret\u201d information. The other two contained \u201cConfidential\u201d information.\nThe full body of Clinton\u2019s work product is already the subject of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.\nVice News reporter Jason Leopold filed suit against the Justice Department last year seeking the deleted or otherwise missing Clinton emails. The agency has argued against the release, filing several secret filings in the case.\nLeopold\u2019s lawyer said that he will continue to pursue the case in federal court.\n\u201cMr. Leopold will pursue the release of the \u2018newly discovered\u2019 emails through both legal vehicles, as appropriate, to ensure the public is as informed as possible before the election,\u201d Leopold\u2019s attorney, Ryan James, told The Journal.", "For a sport as widely played as golf, it's little surprise that every state in America has produced a player who's reached the top of the sport in some way, shape, or form.\nWe didn't use a scientific method to choose the best golfer from all 50 states (plus the District of Columbia), but we looked at career achievements in both amateur and professional circles, with a bias toward professional results, along with the athlete's overall influence.\nHowever, we did decide a golfer had to be born in a particular state to qualify as its representative. For example, although many consider Tiger Woods a Floridian, he counts as a Californian on this list, having been born about 30 minutes from Los Angeles.\nGreen, who died June 19, won 19 times on the PGA Tour, including two majors: the 1977 U.S. Open and the 1985 PGA Championship. Born in Birmingham, Green was a member of three Ryder Cup teams (winning in 1977 and '79) and went undefeated in his singles matches. He was the PGA Tour's Rookie of the Year in 1971 and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2007.\nEdwards won five times on the PGA Tour after only starting to play golf as a 14-year-old. He was born in Ketchikan, in the southeastern part of Alaska (close to central British Columbia, Canada), and went to Oklahoma State, where he was a three-time All-American. He was the low amateur at The Open Championship in 1973, and he's the lone Tour winner from the northern-most state.\nHundreds of professional golfers now call Arizona home (never mind those with Arizona ties, like Arizona State graduate Phil Mickelson), but very few are actually from the Grand Canyon State. Mayfair was born in Phoenix and also attended ASU, so his roots run as deep as his PGA Tour success. The 51-year-old won five times, notably taking down Tiger Woods in a playoff at the former Nissan Open in 1998. He also captured the 1986 U.S. Amateur and was named the country's best collegiate golfer in 1987.\nAlthough many associate Arkansas golf with John Daly or fellow Razorback Stacy Lewis (another two-time major winner and former world No. 1 on the LPGA Tour), neither were actually born in the state.\nFor that, we go to Runyan. Born in Hot Springs, he won 29 times on the PGA Tour, including two PGA Championships. His 1938 PGA Championship triumph came in an 8-and-7 drubbing of legend Sam Snead. Runyan was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1990 and is also a member of the Arkansas Hall of Fame.\nSeventy-nine PGA Tour wins, 14 majors, countless awards and honors \u2026 we could go on, but Woods is simply the most dominant winner in the history of the sport. He attended Stanford before turning professional and has paid tribute to his roots with the Genesis Open in Los Angeles, which benefits his California-based foundation.\nHonorable mention goes to Mickey Wright, a pioneer on the LPGA Tour. The San Diego-born golfer walked away from the sport at 34 with 82 victories on Tour. Of those titles, 13 were majors, and she was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1964.\nAlthough many might tip Hale Irwin as Colorado's best, the 20-time PGA Tour winner (and three-time U.S. Open champion) was actually born in Missouri. Kaye, meanwhile, was born in Denver and won twice on the PGA Tour, in 2003 and '04. Although he hasn\u2019t played a Tour-sanctioned event in a few years, he captured his second Colorado Open title in 2017 - a record 21 years after winning it for the first time.\nThe first woman to tee it up at a PGA Tour event, Whaley was a longtime PGA of America professional in her home state. She played one season on the LPGA Tour in 1993, but her accomplishments and influence away from the golf course give her the edge over Julius Boros (a three-time major champion) on this list. In 2018, Whaley became the first female president of the PGA of America.\nOliver won eight times on the PGA Tour and finished runner-up at three majors between 1946 and 1953. Nicknamed \"Porky,\" as he stood 5-foot-9 and weighed close to 250 pounds, his game was good enough to silence his critics.\nBeman was born in Washington and attended the nearby University of Maryland. A celebrated amateur golfer, he won nine times before turning professional, won four times on the PGA Tour, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2000. But how did he get enshrined with four wins, none of them being majors? Because he served as the second commissioner of the PGA Tour and held the role for 20 years. He formed the PGA Tour Champions and the Web.com Tour, introduced The Players Championship, and grew the PGA Tour's assets from a reported $400,000 in 1974 to $260 million in 1994 (according to a 2011 biography).\nTwo-time U.S. Open winner Brooks Koepka may end up being the best golfer from the Sunshine State, but for now, it's still Duval. The native of Jacksonville won 13 times on the PGA Tour in just four years and toppled Woods as world No. 1 in 1999. Duval also captured the 2001 Open Championship - his lone major and his final professional win.\nA lifelong amateur, Jones' resume is the stuff of legends. In a seven-year stretch, he competed in 20 major championships and won 13 of them. That included claiming all four majors in a single season, and he's still the only golfer to win the Grand Slam in one year. Jones retired from competition at 28, but had a pretty OK career afterward - he co-founded the state's (some would say the world's) greatest golf course, Augusta National.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe Wie is only 28 considering how long her career has already been. At age 10, the native of Honolulu qualified for a USGA-sanctioned event, and by 12, she had already played in an LPGA Tour event. By 15, she had played on the PGA Tour, becoming the fourth woman to ever tee it up beside the men (and she shot a 68 in the second round). Not long after that, she turned professional. Wie has won five times on the LPGA Tour, including one major, the 2014 U.S. Women\u2019s Open.\nHiskey is the lone golfer born in Idaho with a PGA Tour victory, and he has three. Born in Burley, Hiskey won the Idaho Amateur three times before turning professional in 1961, and his three PGA Tour titles came between 1965 and 1972.\nGoalby was born in Belleville - about four-and-a-half hours from Chicago - and won 11 times on the PGA Tour. He stuck around in his home state to attend the University of Illinois. He's probably best remembered for his 1968 Masters victory that came at the expense of Roberto De Vicenzo, who signed an incorrect scorecard. Still, a green jacket is a green jacket.\nZoeller remains the only man to win the Masters in his first attempt, collecting his first of two major titles (he also won the 1985 U.S. Open). Born in New Albany, Zoeller won 10 times total on the PGA Tour and twice more on PGA Tour Champions, including a major title.\nJohnson is a 12-time PGA Tour winner, two of which are majors at all-time venues - the Masters at Augusta National and The Open Championship at St. Andrews. The native of Cedar Rapids took up golf at 10 years old and went to Drake University in Des Moines. Johnson won twice on the Web.com Tour before making it to the PGA Tour, and nips 1955 U.S. Open winner Jack Fleck (born in Bettendorf) as the best golfer from the Hawkeye State.\nAlthough Bruce Lietzke has won 13 times on the PGA Tour, Woodland takes the title since Lietzke moved away before he turned 10. Woodland, from Topeka, attended Washburn University in his hometown on a basketball scholarship before transferring to the University of Kansas on a golf scholarship. He has three PGA Tour wins, including this year's Waste Management Phoenix Open, and has lost in two playoffs.\nIt'd be easy to give this one to Kenny Perry given his 14 PGA Tour victories, but at just 25 years old, Thomas already has more than half (eight) of Perry\u2019s career total and has been ranked No. 1 in the world. Thomas, who was born in Louisville, won the 2017 PGA Championship and will no doubt be looking forward to the event's return to Louisville's Valhalla Golf Club in 2026. Thomas' latest victory was at the Honda Classic earlier this year.\nBy the closest of margins, Sutton takes the title in Louisiana over David Toms.\nSutton won 14 times on the PGA Tour, including one major - the 1983 PGA Championship en route to being named Player of the Year that season. Toms won 13 times on Tour and claimed a PGA Championship title in 2001, but he was never named Player of the Year, and with that slight edge, it's Sutton over Toms in the Pelican State.\nMaine - Mark Peoples Jr.\nOther than Jones in Georgia, professional success was a deciding factor in this list, and although Mark Plummer was a 13-time winner of the Maine Amateur, the best golfer from the state has to be Peoples, who won twice on the PGA Tour. Born in Augusta, Peoples went to the University of Florida on a golf scholarship before turning professional in 1981. He won in consecutive years on Tour, in 1991 and '92.\nThe affable Funk has a longtime connection to Maryland, having graduated from the University of Maryland and even acting as the school\u2019s golf coach for six years before joining the PGA Tour full time in 1989. He won eight times on Tour (including The Players Championship in 2005), and won the OHL Classic at Mayakoba at age 50. Funk has gone on to win nine times on PGA Tour Champions since turning 50, including three majors. He was inducted into the Maryland State Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011.\nWhat a race in the Bay State. In this case, accomplishments outrank impact, which is why Bradley gets the nod.\nBradley, who was born in Westford, won 31 times on the LPGA Tour, including six major championship titles - three of which came in the 1986 season. She was a celebrated amateur in her home state and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1991.\nShe wins a close race over Paul Azinger - a 12-time PGA Tour winner, including the 1993 PGA Championship - and Francis Ouimet (who won the U.S. Open at his home club as a 20-year-old and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974. Ouimet's U.S. Open win was turned into the Hollywood movie, \"The Greatest Game Ever Played.\"\nDiegel won 30 times as a professional in the pre-PGA Tour era, including four Canadian Opens. He also played on the first four Ryder Cup teams and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2003. Out of his 30 victories, two were majors, as he captured back-to-back PGA Championships in 1928 and '29.\nHonorable mention goes to Calvin Peete, who was born in Detroit and notched 12 PGA Tour wins (including The Players Championship in 1986). Peete was the most successful African-American professional golfer until the emergence of Woods.\nLehman was ranked as world No. 1 for just one week, but he'll go down in history as the best golfer from the North Star State. He was ultra-consistent during the 1990s and won five times including the 1996 Open Championship, his lone major. He's the only golfer in history to be named Player of the Year on the Web.com Tour, the PGA Tour, and the PGA Tour Champions. Since turning 50, Lehman has won 11 times on the senior circuit, including three majors.\nTalk about a legacy. Brown, who suffered from polio in the 1950s, managed to recover and win 14 times professionally, including twice on the PGA Tour. His first victory, at the 1964 Waco Turner Open, was the first PGA Tour win by an African-American in history.\nBorn in Kansas City, Watson was a decorated amateur in his home state before submitting one of the most elite careers in the history of professional golf. He won 39 times on the PGA Tour, including five Open Championships, a memorable U.S. Open, and two Masters. He was named Player of the Year six times, nearly won the Open Championship in 2009 as a 59-year-old, won 14 times on PGA Tour Champions, and was named to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1988.\nAlthough Ritzman never won on the LPGA Tour, she put together a tremendous career that lasted nearly two decades. She claimed the state amateur in back-to-back years before turning professional and ended up losing in three LPGA Tour playoffs (all to future Hall of Famers). She was also the first golfer on the LPGA Tour to make three eagles in a round (a record matched by four others since Ritzman did it in 1979).\nCalcavecchia won 13 times on the PGA Tour including one major, The Open Championship in 1989. It came a year after he was the runner-up at the Masters, and it was one of his six top-10 finishes at majors including The Open in 2009 when he was nearly 50. He also set a PGA Tour record in 2009 by making nine straight birdies at the RBC Canadian Open.\nHonorable mention goes to Johnny Goodman - the last amateur to win the U.S. Open (1933).\nBorn and raised in Las Vegas, Piercy won twice on the Web.com Tour in 2008 to earn his PGA Tour status the following year, and he's never looked back. And, in classic Las Vegas style, he was nearly broke before he won $2 million in \"The Ultimate Game\" at Wynn Las Vegas Golf and Country Club in 2007 to help finance his golf career. Piercy has won four times on the PGA Tour, including this year at the Zurich Classic.\nBlalock won the New Hampshire Amateur five times before turning professional in 1969 - and what a run she went on after that. She enjoyed a 17-year LPGA Tour career that included 27 wins and 34 professional victories worldwide. She became just the seventh woman in history to win more than $1 million in a season, and although she doesn't officially have any majors to her credit, she did win the Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle in 1972 before it was awarded \"major\" status (it's now known as the ANA Inspiration).\nGhezzi won 11 times on the PGA Tour including one major, the 1941 PGA Championship. Although he was also selected for three Ryder Cup teams, they were all canceled due to World War II. He notched 17 worldwide victories as a professional and nearly won a second major at the 1946 U.S. Open, but fell short in a playoff. He was inducted into the PGA of America Hall of Fame in 1965.\nWhile many identify Nancy Lopez as the favorite daughter of New Mexico, she was actually born just outside of San Diego and didn't move to New Mexico until she was nearly a teenager. Because of that, the honor for best golfer from the Land of Enchantment goes to Steve Jones, who won the 1996 U.S. Open. Jones won seven other times on the PGA Tour, but none of those top his U.S. Open triumph, where he became the first sectional qualifier to win since Jerry Pate in 1976.\nHow could you choose, really?\nSarazen (born in Harrison) won the career Grand Slam and was a seven-time major champion with 39 total PGA Tour victories. He's also credited as inventing the sand wedge, and was known as the golfer who hit the \"shot heard 'round the world\" at the 1935 Masters (a 4-wood from 235 yards that dropped into the hole for an albatross on the par-5 15th).\nHagen (born in Rochester) won 45 times on the PGA Tour and his 11 major championship titles are third all time behind Jack Nicklaus and Woods. He won a record four straight PGA Championships from 1924-27 and has long been known as one of the sport's greats.\nIf either of the two icons were born in separate states they almost certainly would have made this list, so we're not going to punish them for hailing from the same one.\nLots of golfing talent has emerged from the Tar Heel State including major winners Davis Love III, Mark O'Meara, and Webb Simpson, but it's Floyd whose record tops them all. He won 66 times worldwide - 22 times on the PGA Tour - and claimed four majors, which matches the total won by Love, O'Meara, and Simpson. Floyd was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1989.\nHanson is North Dakota\u2019s best golfing product and it's not even close. The Fargo native played only a decade on the LPGA Tour, from 1951-61, but she started her career with a bang, winning the first event she entered as a professional. The 17-time Tour winner also claimed three majors and topped the money list in 1958.\nThere's not much that needs to be said about The Golden Bear and his accomplishments. Other than perhaps Lebron James, Nicklaus is the most notable athlete in history to come from the Buckeye State.\nHe's a Hall of Famer, won more majors than anyone else (18), has 71 Tour victories, is an accomplished golf-course designer\u2026 and on and on. He's not just the best golfer from Ohio - he may be the best to ever play the game, period.\nThe Oklahoma City product is best known for sinking Greg Norman with a holed-out bunker shot on the 72nd hole of the 1986 PGA Championship. Tway won eight times total on the PGA Tour, and his son, Kevin, is also a Tour professional.\nThe Oregon Ducks put the Pacific Northwest back on the golfing map by winning the 2016 NCAA Championship (plus, the collection of courses in Bandon, Ore., are some of the best on the planet), but the area hasn't produced a ton of notable players. That said, Peter Jacobsen - who's known more now for his comedy and broadcasting prowess - has an excellent Tour record, with seven wins and two Ryder Cup appearances. Jacobsen, who was born in Portland, has also won twice on the senior circuit - both of them being major championships.\nThis is another no-brainer, with Palmer going down in history as one of the most important icons of the sport. The native of Latrobe learned to play from his father at Latrobe Country Club, where Arnold still had a workshop up until his death in 2016. He won 62 times on the PGA Tour (fifth most all time), including seven majors. He was golf's king of cool.\nBorn in Bristol, Andrade won four times on the PGA Tour and won three times (all in 2015) on PGA Tour Champions after turning 50. Andrade is also a big-time giver to the community, as he's co-hosted the CVS Charity Classic at the Rhode Island Country Club since 1999, helping raise millions of dollars.\nJohnson gets the nod for the Palmetto State, and could eventually go down as one of the game's all-time greats. The current world No. 1 has triumphed 18 times on the PGA Tour, including twice this season. He's got only one major title to his credit (the 2016 U.S. Open), but could have won a handful more without a few late-tournament gaffes. Since he's just in his early 30s, Johnson's got at least another decade of high-level competition in him.\nEureka! We\u2019ve chosen the best from South Dakota. Hagge (born in the town of Eureka) was one of the original founders of the LPGA Tour in 1950 and won 26 times in her career. Hagge claimed one major championship (1956) and was the Tour's leading money winner that same year. She was inducted into both the LPGA Hall of Fame and the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2002.\nAlthough Brandt Snedeker would be a nice contemporary choice, the title of best golfer from Tennessee goes to Middlecoff, who won 40 times on the PGA Tour. Three of those were majors - the 1949 and 1956 U.S. Opens and the 1955 Masters. He's also a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame; not bad for a guy who was originally a dentist.\nIn a tight race filled with strong contenders, Hogan just barely nips his contemporary Byron Nelson (he of 52 tournament victories including five majors) and Kathy Whitworth (the winningest female golfer in history), not to mention Lee Trevino (six majors) and Babe Didrikson Zaharias (10 LPGA majors and a gold medal in track and field at the 1932 Olympics). Hogan won 64 times as a professional including nine majors (three in 1953) and is credited as having one of the greatest golf swings of all time. In 1949, he was nearly killed in a head-on car accident but recovered from myriad injuries and won 11 more times.\nWe are going with a contemporary choice over a legacy choice here (George Van Elm was a decorated amateur and won five times on the PGA Tour in the late 1920s and early 1930s), as all signs are pointing to Finau having a tremendous career. He's already won once on both the PGA Tour and the Web.com Tour and has notched two top-10 finishes in majors this year. He's primed to break out, and given that optimism, he's the greatest from the Beehive State.\nThe second Bradley on this list (Keegan's aunt, Pat, is the best golfer from Massachusetts) was born in Woodstock and burst onto the scene in 2011. He won twice as a rookie, including the PGA Championship - the first major he ever played. He was named PGA Tour Rookie of the Year that season and went on to win again in 2012 at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.\n\"Slammin' Sammy\" Snead is the all-time winningest golfer in PGA Tour history, with 82 victories. That's about all you need to stake a claim for Snead as the best golfer from Virginia, but we'll keep going. Of his 82 wins, seven were majors - although he had a Phil Mickelson-like four runner-up finishes at the U.S. Open and never won the Grand Slam. He was the oldest player to win a PGA Tour event (52 years, 10 months), and was the only golfer to ever place in the top 10 in a major in five different decades.\nThe smoothest of the smooth, Couples saunters into the top spot from Washington. He was a two-time PGA Tour Player of the Year (1991 and '92) and captured his lone major championship at the Masters in 1992 before continuing to shine at the event as he got older. Couples won 15 times on the PGA Tour and has won 13 times on PGA Tour Champions, including two majors. He still plays on the senior circuit despite battling numerous back injuries and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2013.\nBorn in Huntington, Campbell was a lifetime amateur golfer who won 32 times including one U.S. Amateur (finally, after 37 tries). Fifteen of those victories came at the West Virginia Amateur, making him a local legend. He was a two-time president of the United States Golf Association and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1990.\nAlthough Andy North gets a passing glance due to his two U.S. Open titles, he only has three total PGA Tour titles. With that, Stricker- and his 12 PGA Tour victories - is the best from Wisconsin and gets to say \"cheese\" in a photo finish. He reached No. 2 in the Official World Golf Ranking in both 2009 and '10 and is 12th on the PGA Tour's all-time money list. Not only that, but when Stricker was down, he was never out; he won the PGA Tour's Comeback Player of the Year honor twice, in both 2006 and '07.\nBenepe was a decorated amateur golfer in his home state and during his collegiate career, helping lead Northwestern to a handful of titles. He won on both the Canadian Tour and in Australia after turning professional. In his first-ever PGA Tour event in 1988 (he got in with a sponsor exemption), Benepe won, and was the Tour's top rookie that season.", "Liversedge suffered a 5-1 defeat away to Albion Sports as they continue to struggle in the Northern Counties East League Premier Division.\nLiversedge are in the middle of a horrendous run of away fixtures as they have not played at Clayborn since beating Barton Town Old Boys back on October 31.\nThey are not due to play at home until Cleethorpes Town visit on January 5, by which time it will have been over two months since they trotted out on their own midden.\nSedge have submitted an application to Sport England for funds to carry out additional drainage works on the pitch under their \u2018preservation of playing fields\u2019 grants and a decision is expected in February.\nClayborn is the only floodlight football pitch in the Spen Valley and the club see securing the funding as crucial to increasing the number of matches played at the ground.\nLiversedge only trailed 1-0 at half-time at Albion Sports following Jordan Hendrie\u2019s goal after 30 minutes.\nAntony Hilton equalised straight after half-time with his first league goal of the season but just a minute later Marcus Edwards restored Albion\u2019s advantage.\nLiversedge\u2019s task became even greater as Omar Habib made it 3-1 after 53 minutes and Edwards then put the home side out of reach with his second goal.\nHabib also completed his brace seven minutes from full-time as Liversedge slipped to a 13th defeat of the season.\nThey are third-bottom, just a point above Parkgate and five ahead of bottom side Brigg Town ahead of Saturday\u2019s trip to Barton Town.", "When thousands of laid-off workers marched down Victory Road in Liaoyang, China, this month, protesting corrupt factory leaders, the foreign media was tipped off by something called the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy. When an evangelical Bible smuggler faced a possible death penalty in China early this year \u0096 the world knew through the center.\nOf the known human-rights cases in China, about two-thirds first come to light from the Hong Kong-based outfit, China watchers say.\nYet the \"center\" is just one person \u0096 a Chinese Don Quixote named Frank Lu Siqing.\nArmed with a cellphone, a pager, and a rare network of some 2,000 mainland sources, Mr. Lu works 14- hour days, tilting at the windmills of Chinese state security and disseminating news that does not appear in China's state-controlled media.\nWhat's remarkable given his subject, supporters say, is that Lu is practically the only person doing such work.\nConduits of information out of China on prisoners of conscience or dissenters have dried up, leaving mainly second- or third-hand networks of academics and exiles.\n\"Practically no one is left,\" says one American source. \"They are either retired or in prison.\"\n\"In China, the scale of abuses is very large. What we know is the tip of the iceberg,\" says Robin Munro, a veteran British-based human-rights expert. \"In most parts of the world, human-rights awareness comes from the NGO community, people plugged into activist circles. In China, since 1949, no groups have been allowed in. A human rights monitoring effort in China invariably means arrest. What allows Lu to exist is his base in Hong Kong, and his sources.\"\nCHINA watchers say his sources \u0096 who report on news that is omitted or not considered for official media \u0096 give Lu's operation its edge. For example, China to this day has not reported on nearly two months of protests \u0096 both in the north and the south \u0096 of laid off workers seeking pensions and back pay.\nUntil last year, Lu ran his entire operation out of a single crowded room in a Hong Kong walk-up. Since 1996, he has single-handedly put out some 2,500 reports on cases of abuse \u0096 twice as many as the three major China human-rights watch groups combined.\nLu was born in Hunan Province, in central China. But he says his parents left him when he was two months old. They were forced to participate in the Cultural Revolution, the Mao-dictated project of social engineering to overhaul traditional China. Lu was raised by a family friend, and did not see his parents for nearly 13 years. \"This was very painful,\" he says. \"I don't want to talk about it.\"\nBut he remembers reading Chinese characters at age 5, considered early. Such reading included the political posters that saturated public spaces during the Mao era. \"Even then, I knew it was a lie. Even as a child, you have some judgment, and you see these writings, and you know they aren't true.\"\nAt the same time, Lu dreamed of being able to say what he wanted. \"I wanted free expression. I was so angry. I felt the lie could not be changed, yet I remained angry at the lie.\nYear by year, you think this over...\"\nOver the years, he has carved out a network of mainlanders willing to call his beeper. Some are remnants of the shattered political dissident movements or families or friends of detainees. Others are mainland Chinese reporters who phone him from public booths, where calls are harder to trace.\n\"I get a lot of leads on my pager from local journalists in China,\" says Lu.\n\"They know the big news, but are frustrated that they can't tell it. Some of the time, they feel guilty and they call.\"\nThis week, when China labor camp veteran and whistle blower Harry Wu was denied access to Hong Kong, when American Chinese scholars were detained, when members of the outlawed Falun Gong were sent to prison \u0096 Lu sent a fax to media representatives throughout Asia.\nNot all see Lu in laudatory terms, however. Some view him as a \"one man band.\" He has been criticized for not sharing sources, for trying to monopolize, and at one point for belittling other groups. Moreover, when Lu first got started in the early 1990s, he was accused of fabricating two reports.\nYet in recent years, his reputation has turned around. He is now known for double-checking facts and hand writing press releases so they can't be forged or duplicated. \"I've watched his faxes and reports for many years. What's amazing \u0096 and I don't use that word often \u0096 is that to my knowledge, I've never seen him proved wrong. Basically, there is everyone else, and there is Frank Lu.\"\nIn person Lu is unassuming, matter of fact, and a bit restless. He says he suffers from insomnia and other stress-related conditions. He changes cellphones every month, reports that he is sometimes followed, and worries that authorities in Hong Kong, evermore bending to authorities in Beijing, are looking for excuses to shut him down.\nHE ALSO says that human-rights work has become extremely difficult. The Chinese economy has been performing well and a new generation of Chinese aren't interested. Funding is also difficult (Lu operates off one main $20,000 grant per year).\n\"The human rights period in China is slowing down,\" he says. \"It has been forgotten.\"\nTo some, the point seems dramatized by the recent absence of criticism in the Geneva forum, an outcome China has long sought.\n\"Chinese security forces have been effective in rolling up all organized political dissent,\" says Andrew Nathan of Columbia University in New York. \"The last organized movement I know of was the Chinese Democracy Party, all of whose leaders are now in jail. Human rights work on China is a hard slog for all the groups involved.\"\nBeijing officials argue that, gradually, rights are improving in China. They say China has a different concept of human rights, and highlight progress in fundamental areas, like feeding and clothing their enormous population.\n\"China seeks mutual equality and respect [on the question of human rights],\" said foreign media spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue. \"China wishes to develop a common consensus and cooperation.\"\nWhat Lu and others now focus on are crackdowns on underground churches, on spiritual movements like the Falun Gong inside China (itself, largely shut down), and the recent protests of xiagang, or laid off workers. Last month in Liaoning province, coal, steel, and petrochemical workers protested about what they say are inadequate pensions.\nWhen asked why so many of his sources will talk with him, Lu says he adopts a very simple approach. When Lu calls a police station or the courts, or local witnesses, he doesn't say he is a human rights monitor. \"They would just hang up.\" Instead, he says, he operates on the assumption that people want to tell the truth. \"I eventually say, 'I just want to know the truth,' and people respond.\"", "Since becoming South Korea's President earlier this year, Kim Dae Jung has brought a new tone to diplomacy with the Communist North.\nKim Dae Jung joined a fellow dissident, Kim Young Sam, today as joint leaders of the group behind a new opposition faction that finished a strong second to the Government party in parliamentary elections last month.\nLEAD: An opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, urged President Roh Tae Woo today to accept a North Korean call for political and military talks on easing tension on the peninsula.\nLEAD: Kim Dae Jung, who appeared to be in political decline in the aftermath of the presidential election earlier this year, emerged from this week's National Assembly election as South Korea's strongest opposition figure.\nThe South Korean Government is making preparations to free Kim Dae Jung, Seoul's most prominent political prisoner, on Saturday, dissidents and Korean diplomats here said today.\nLEAD: The last time South Korea had a real presidential election, in 1971, the opposition candidate was a young firebrand named Kim Dae Jung.\nKim Dae Jung, the opposition leader, said today that he would renounce his plans to run for President in 1988 if the Government heeded the opposition's call for direct elections.\nFollowing are excerpts from President Kim Dae Jung's inaugural address today, as translated by the South Korean Government: At this very important juncture, we have run into a foreign exchange crisis that is the most serious national crisis since the Korean War.\nKim Chi Ha, a renowned poet and one of South Korea's best-known political prisoners, may soon be released from prison, where he is serving a 20-year sentence on charges of Communist conspiracy against the state, diplomatic sources here said today.\nWhen he was awaiting execution on death row in 1980, Kim Dae Jung wrote anguished letters to one of his sons, apologizing that no parents would allow their daughter to marry him, that no business dared give him a job.", "Originally Published: October 25, 2018 5:11 p.m.\nWe are approaching our winter weather, and from experience our weather can take a toll on more than just our cars and our attitudes. Concrete walks, driveway, steps all take a pounding from the elements and the deicing chemicals that we apply.\nSome people find the world of de-icers, ice melters, anti-icers, or basic ice removal compounds somewhat confusing especially with all the claims various manufacturers make regarding these products. We hope our column will help you navigate through the maze of confusion.\nWhat is the difference between a de-icer, ice-melter or an anti-icer you ask?\nAnything used to melt the ice is considered to be a deicer or ice-melter. It does not matter what the material composition is or what format it comes in. Ice-melter can be in variety of formats, such as granular, flakes, pellets, pearls, powder or even in a liquid format. Many people assume that the word ice-melter means that it is somehow eco-friendly. This simply is not the case. Rock salt is an ice-melter.\nAn anti-icer is any product that can be applied to a surface before a storm to help prevent ice build-up from occurring. Anti-icer does not eliminate ice build-up, but rather just delays it enough and forms a slush so it can be removed easier.\nWhat different types of ice-melters are there?\nThere are many different chemicals that can go into making up a de-icer; however, only a few base compounds are used, due to price and availability. They are: rock salt (sodium chloride), magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium chloride, urea, CMA (calcium magnesium accetate), NAAC (sodium accetate) and liquid glychol. Many products sold today are merely re-packaged commodities of rock salt, natural or artificially colored.\nCMA is a salt-free deicing agent made from acetic acid and dolomitic lime. Although this de-icing compound is more expensive than most salts or combination deicers, it is less damaging to the driveway surface and plants, making it suitable for use in environmentally sensitive areas.\nWhat type of ice-melter should be used on new concrete?\nNone. No ice-melter should be used on newly poured concrete, as concrete requires a certain length of time to cure. This amount of time can vary depending on the type of concrete. It is best not to use ice-melter on new or unsealed concrete less than 12 months old, exposed aggregate, brick, or pre-cast steps. Applying ice-melter to damaged, cracked or chipped concrete may result in further damage due to the thaw and re-freeze cycles.\nSome ice-melters containing ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulphate additives will rapidly disintegrate concrete and therefore should not be used.\nWhy should people avoid using calcium chloride ice-melters?\nBesides the fact that calcium chloride causes damage to concrete by having a very short thaw/freeze cycle, and causes discoloration of concretep; calcium chloride inherently attracts moisture \u2013 is hygroscopic -- and therefore has a limited shelf life. Further, calcium chloride leaves behind an oily residue, which is easily tracked into buildings, soiling and damaging carpets and floorings and presenting a serious slip/fall hazard. Calcium chloride is harmful to the environment -- damaging plant life, soil and the water system. Also, people must be very careful when using calcium chloride as it caustic and will burn skin causing an irritation. It should not be used around pets.\nWhy should people avoid using rock salt or sodium chloride?\nRock salt has an enormously negative effect on the environment as it is toxic to vegetation and damaging to soil. Rock salt or sodium chloride is not only harmful to plant life but also the soil that sustains life.\nBy far the most risk of damage to your concrete during the winter months is attributed to the freeze/thaw cycle. This is the buildup of water (melted ice) being absorbed into porous concrete, which then freezes and expands. This expansion within the concrete causes pressure to build up, and eventually this build up will exceed the limit that the concrete was built to withstand and when the pressure becomes too much for the concrete to withstand, scaling generally occurs.\nThe freeze/thaw cycle is a natural process and there is no way of eliminating it. However, to reduce the damage caused by this cycle, it is strongly recommended that after applying the ice melt and when the ice turns to slush, that the slush be removed from the pavement, sidewalk or driveway to reduce the amount of water that may penetrate the concrete, thus reducing the pressure build-up.", "Massachusetts has become the sixteenth state to ban conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth.\nGov. Charlie Baker (R) on Monday signed into law a bill that would ban licensed health care professionals from carrying out the highly criticized practice on those under the age of 18.\nWidely debunked by most major medical professional organizations, conversion therapy tries to forcibly change a person\u2019s sexuality or gender identity through various means \u2014 ranging from talk therapy, to more extreme methods such as electroshock or aversion therapy.\nBaker signed the bill despite objections from his own party, with Republicans in the Massachusetts Senate arguing that the legislation would prevent parents from controlling their children, or infringe on a therapist\u2019s right to free speech.\nSimilar arguments have been used against conversion therapy bans in other areas of the country, including Florida and New Jersey.\nThe Human Rights Campaign similarly applauded Gov. Baker and Massachusetts lawmakers for advancing the bill into law.\n\u201cThis law is an extraordinarily invasive assault on the rights of parents to raise their children and a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech for the counselors whose help they seek,\u201d Andrew Beckwith, the group\u2019s president, said in a statement.\nLawmakers are under increasing pressure to ban conversion therapy, particularly on LGBTQ youth who can be subjected to torturous practices against their will.\nAnd earlier in April, U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney introduced legislation that would prevent taxpayer money from being used to fund conversion therapy.\nMaloney\u2019s bill would prohibit Medicaid funds from being used to reimburse therapists who engage in conversion therapy, and would define \u201cconversion therapy\u201d to ensure that organizations providing legitimate mental health services and support to LGBTQ people are not at risk of losing funding.\nSeveral prominent members of the conversion therapy \u2014 or \u201cex-gay\u201d \u2014 movement have also come out against the practice, slamming it as ineffective and advocating for it being banned.\nIn February, David Matheson, a former \u201cex-gay\u201d advocate who spent years promoting conversion therapy to LGBTQ Mormons, finally admitted that the practice does not work and should be stopped.\nIn an interview with Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News, Matheson said that conversion therapy \u201cjust can\u2019t\u201d change a person\u2019s sexual orientation, that it \u201cshould be stopped\u201d in the U.S., and expressed regret over the harm caused to LGBTQ people by his work.\nIn January, John Smid \u2014 former executive director of Love in Action, a conversion therapy organization \u2014 stated that the practice does not work and should be stopped.\nSmid, who inspired a character in conversion therapy drama Boy Erased, wrote in a column for the Advocate that organizations still advocating for the practice in 2019 \u201cblithely disregard the mountain of evidence\u201d against it.\nAnd in 2013, Alan Chambers, president of conversion therapy umbrella organization Exodus International, came out as gay and shutterd Exodus for good.\nChambers said that conversion therapy should be banned for adults, not just minors, and unlike Matheson, both he and Smid are working to make amends for the damage inflicted by their work.", "Now for a clove-up look at one of the world's great fan clubs.\nDuring this the week of the reek--more specifically the third annual Los Angeles Garlic Week--it is time to turn attention to an association whose members feel there is more to garlic than meets the nose.\nLovers of the Stinking Rose, they call themselves, and at last count there were an estimated 5,000 of them around the world--perhaps 500 or so here in Southern California.\n\"We are a casual organization,\" Lloyd John Harris, the founder, conceded while here for the week's observances. \"We only have festivals, no formal meetings.\"\nIn other words, no need for Robert's Rules of Odor.\nAll that is needed to belong to this select group is a passion for garlic, plus payment of one-time membership dues of $18, which entitles a person to a copy of Harris' work, \"The Book of Garlic,\" a peeping tome into the wonderful world of that plant.\nFurthermore, the member gets a bumper sticker (\"Fight Mouthwash, Eat Garlic\") and a lifetime subscription to Garlic Times, a newsletter issued two or three times a year by Aris Books in Berkeley. Read it and reek.\nAs head of that cookbook publishing company, Harris is a man for all seasons, but he reserves a special fondness for garlic. Indeed, the newsletter has crusaded for it on more than one front.\nTo be sure, the battle isn't always won. When a Miami firm--Smell It Like It Is Inc.--began manufacturing T-shirts with fragrances such as bananas, oranges, root beer--Lovers of the Stinking Rose asked for the production of garlic-scented shirts.\nNo luck. When it came to mighty Lever Brothers Co. and Signal Mouthwash, however, there was a victory of sorts. If you can label a televised debate as such.\nMaybe it wasn't Lincoln-Douglas, or even Coke-Pepsi, but viewers of a television station in New York City did get to watch a Lever research chemist and Harris argue garlic breath and mouthwash. As in all such debates, each side claimed victory.\nWhat brought it all about was a reaction by the garlic association to what it calls \"the mouthwash conspiracy.\" In particular, the advertising for Signal Mouthwash claimed that it halted bad breath caused by the \"strongest of all\" mouth odors--garlic and onions.\n\"I wrote their people and pointed out that the odor of garlic is exuded in the normal process of perspiration. Mouthwash only masks it,\" Harris recalled. \"You would have to take a mouthwash bath. I almost did that as a stunt.\"\nGarlic breath is good breath, he continued. \"The ruin of any outstanding French, Chinese or Italian meal would be to kill the fragrant after-taste with a commercial mouthwash,\" he wrote his members in his newsletter.\nThen there was the sparring with American Express Co.\nEver since garlic lovers banded together 11 years ago, they have wanted identification. Three years ago, Harris came out with \"Garlic Express,\" looking like a credit card and bearing the slogan: \"Don't Eat Out Without It.\"\n\"The idea was that when a member displayed one in a restaurant, he or she would be entitled to extra garlic at no additional cost,\" the founder said. \"We got a letter from the American Express lawyers, telling us to desist because we were violating a trademark and trying to compete.\"\nHarris said he has backed off on distributing them, and is in the process of getting permission from another credit card firm for a different facsimile.\nThis evangelist of the clove also finds his time occupied with such matters as participating in the week's observance here, sponsored by his group and the Nucleus Nuance Restaurant. More than 20 eateries are offering such dishes as garlic ice cream, candied garlic apples, and garlic mousse.\nDon't laugh. Eleanor Roosevelt lived to be 78, and was a proponent of garlic. \"She used to tout chocolate-covered garlic,\" Harris said, \"although I consider that gilding the garlic.\"\nAnother advocate was author Henry Miller, who lived to be 88. He once wrote in a letter to Harris: \"I have always considered garlic one of the four cornerstones of good health; the other three being honey, olive oil and yogurt.\"\n\"I first put whole cloves into boiling water. When I remove them, I poach the eggs in the same water. I spread the softened cloves onto toast and put the eggs on top.\"\nThere are cocktail lounges, he went on, that serve a gartini--using a pickled garlic glove instead of an olive. Also available is garlic wine, produced by a winery in Gilroy.\nHarris and his disciples feel that garlic is making a comeback. \"It is the immigrant influence,\" he explained. \"In former times the Europeans, in order to assimilate into our society, gave up garlic. The Asians, however, preserve both their culture and their cuisine.\"\nThroughout history, of course, there have been all manner of claims for the bulb. The ancient Romans held it in high repute as an aphrodisiac. It has also been regarded by some as a remedy for everything from earaches to insomnia.\nNowadays, on health food counters, a customer may find odor-free garlic capsules, labeled \"sociable garlic.\"\nThis is nothing less than unthinkable to a purist such as Harris, champion of the bulb-snatchers.", "Deep in northern Italy, just south of the Swiss border, is the Stelvio Pass, one of the world\u2019s great driving roads.\nIt\u2019s the second highest pass in the Alps, at 2757 metres, and on either side it descends like a coiled snake into the bowels of the earth, especially the northern route down to the village of Trafoi, where you have to negotiate 48 hairpin corners in 14km.\nIf you\u2019re in this part of Europe, rent a car \u2014 the faster the better \u2014 and have a go at it, early in the morning or late in the afternoon when all the other petrolheads, cyclists and tourists have left.\nThe fact that Alfa Romeo calls its new mid-size SUV the Stelvio tells you precisely its intent \u2014 to compete at the pointy end of the class, where the Porsche Macan rules.\nWe\u2019re testing the Stelvio Ti, priced at $78,900. It overdelivers on performance and luxe at this price compared with German rivals.\nAlfa\u2019s 2.0-litre turbo four produces 206kW of power, put to the road via an eight-speed automatic/all-wheel drive with a mechanical limited-slip rear differential.\nClaimed time for the 0-100km/h sprint is 5.7 seconds, so Ti won\u2019t pucker your cheeks like the top of the range $149,900, 375kW 2.9-litre turbo V6 Quadrifoglio \u2014 the fastest SUV in the class at 3.8 seconds \u2014 but it will show its tail-lights to most of the field.\nPremium running gear includes bespoke suspension dampers from specialist maker Koni and 20-inch alloy wheels shod with 255/40 Michelin tyres.\nLeather upholstery, heated front seats, dual zone aircon, alloy pedals, keyless entry and start, remote opening windows, power tailgate, tinted glass and parking sensors are also standard.\nAlfa does a great sports seat, firm yet luxuriously comfortable, supportive and heavily bolstered with an extendable cushion.\nYou face an elegant, old-fashioned dash with double-barrel analog instruments and rotary controls. In your hands is Alfa\u2019s lovely thin-rimmed, leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with the engine stop-start button under the left spoke \u2014 in exactly the same spot Ferrari puts it \u2014 and long, slim, fixed shift paddles in cool-to-the-touch metal, again a la Ferrari.\nInfotainment, modelled on BMW\u2019s iDrive, is reasonably intuitive, though you can occasionally get lost in the menus; the rear camera display is small and blurred.\nVoice control usually gets it right and smartphone mirroring is standard. Wireless charging is not provided.\nFirm and comfortable, the rear bench can become tight for legroom if front occupants are tall. The ride is firm and fidgety, with the occasional harsh thump on choppy surfaces. Compliance improves at speed but there are smoother-riding SUVs around \u2014 the optional adaptive suspension dampers, at $2200, may improve comfort.\nThe Stelvio is comprehensively equipped at base model level and the Ti adds adaptive cruise.\nAlfa\u2019s 2.0-litre turbo sounds more like a diesel than a performance petrol engine but it pulls with a mean, sinewy edge from about 2500rpm to almost 6000rpm and powers the relatively light (1619kg) Ti up the road at a rapid rate.\nPeak torque of 400Nm kicks in at a relatively high 2250rpm, so it\u2019s a bit short on bottom end grunt \u2014 a typical Alfa, in other words.\nIt\u2019s frugal on the highway at 6-7L/100km but you can push consumption towards the mid-teens if you leadfoot it in town. Expect 10L-12L/100km in suburban driving, on premium.\nThe eight-speed auto chases fuel economy in Eco and Normal modes; in Dynamic it tends to hold tenaciously to the lower gears in the hope you\u2019ll depress the accelerator once more.\nMid-corner, with your hands at 12 and 6 o\u2019clock, your fingers can\u2019t reach the paddle-shifters. Ferrari (and Alfa) counter that you should have changed gears before you entered the corner, so stop whingeing and learn to drive.\nThe rear-drive bias and 50-50 weight distribution endow tidy, neutral cornering characteristics under power. However, the featherlight steering \u2014 extremely direct for a relatively tall SUV \u2014 can also make it feel twitchy and unbalanced when you first point it into a bend or change direction quickly.\nYou have to learn to use tiny, millimetre-perfect inputs at the wheel, then it works.\nAlfa\u2019s brake-by-wire also takes some getting used to \u2014 touchy on light applications around town, the pedal lacks feel throughout, though stopping power from speed is fine.\nItaly makes the most beautiful cars in the world and now, at last, it\u2019s making this beautiful SUV. I\u2019ll have mine in red, of course.\nAlfa has to offer better value than the Germans to get on buyers\u2019 shortlists.

Egypt is building an underground steel wall, reported to extend somewhere between 18 and 30 meters deep, to cut off the tunnels through which Gazans smuggle in everything from rockets to refrigerators. Cairo has also blocked the entry of convoys of international pro-Palestinian campaigners and Hamas sympathizers like British Parliament member George Galloway, bearing food and other aid.\nIn response, Palestinians have demonstrated violently on the Gazan side of the border; shots have been exchanged, and the unrest has spread to el-Arish, the Sinai\u2019s biggest town.\nOn January 6, an Egyptian soldier was killed by a Hamas gunman at the border. That following Friday, imams in Cairo\u2019s mosques were instructed to preach anti-Hamas sermons, and the Egyptian press is printing anti-Hamas opinion articles.\nPrior to these events, Egypt\u2019s president, Hosni Mubarak, had berated Hamas for failing to sign an Egyptian-brokered agreement to establish a new Palestinian unity government. And a few months earlier, Egypt essentially admitted failure in its mediation effort between Hamas and Israel regarding a prisoner exchange and turned the task over to a German diplomat.\nCairo\u2019s governing elite has long harbored hostility toward Hamas; it\u2019s a wonder that it took so long for it to be vented. For years, Cairo looked the other way while the tunnel smuggling into Gaza went on. But since Hamas took exclusive control of Gaza in a June 2007 coup, a series of factors have come together to force the Egyptian government to take an increasingly aggressive approach.\nThe most obvious challenge is the ideological appeal to Egyptian Islamists of the Hamas \u201cemirate\u201d adjacent to Egypt on the Mediterranean coast. At the domestic political level, the Mubarak regime has a huge problem with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, of which Hamas is basically an offshoot. Mubarak clearly wants to separate Hamas and the Brotherhood to the greatest extent possible.\nAt the same time, the cease-fire arrangements that ended Israel\u2019s controversial Operation Cast Lead included an international commitment to intercept arms being smuggled into Gaza. Iran and its Lebanese agent and ally, Hezbollah, have been key players in arming Hamas. But some of their militants and smuggled munitions have remained in Egypt, where Hezbollah agents have been caught spying and planning terror attacks. This has provided Cairo with a clear incentive to cooperate with the international effort to prevent smuggling.\nAt sea, the naval interception effort, spearheaded by the United States and Israel, has registered some success. On land, the subterranean wall Egypt is building, apparently with American know-how and even financing, is a major Egyptian contribution to this campaign.\nEgypt\u2019s tough new stance toward Hamas is enabled by Cairo\u2019s current efforts to help restart peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine Liberation Organization, Hamas\u2019s rival. This effort provides Cairo with political cover in the Arab world for its confrontational approach toward Hamas.\nBut Egyptian efforts against Hamas are also aimed at Israel. Egyptians are concerned when they hear about schemes advocated by some Israelis that would effectively make Gaza Egypt\u2019s problem. Some in Israel have suggested that Gaza should be linked to northern Sinai as part of an eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement or that the Israeli border crossings into Gaza should be closed as a means of forcing Egypt to take responsibility for meeting Gaza\u2019s needs. While such ideas have never been embraced by the Israeli government, Egypt knows that they are raised prominently in Israeli political discourse. Closing the tunnels thus sends a message to Israel: Gaza is your baby. Indeed, if Cairo\u2019s strategy toward the Gaza Strip can be summed up in a few words, it is that the Palestinian powder keg should be Israel\u2019s problem, not Egypt\u2019s.\nMeanwhile, Hamas is being squeezed on all fronts, from the subterranean wall that Egypt is building to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s recent insistence that Israel will offer no further concessions toward a prisoner exchange. If Israel and the PLO succeed, with American and Egyptian help, in renewing peace negotiations, that too would squeeze Hamas politically.\nIn the coming months, the completion of Egypt\u2019s wall could create major shortages in Gaza, not only of rockets to fire at Israel but of mundane goods and foodstuffs as well. This raises the question: Will Hamas bend, or will it lash out? A recent spate of rocket fire aimed at Israel could be a harbinger of things to come. Certainly, it\u2019s hard to believe that Egypt\u2019s wall will succeed \u2014 any more than Israel\u2019s economic siege of the Gaza Strip has \u2014 in ending Hamas rule over Gaza.\nStill, it took a lot of Hamas provocation for the Mubarak regime to strike back in this way. This suggests that it must feel genuinely threatened by radical Islam. As much consternation as the rise of Hamas in Gaza has prompted, even the specter of Islamist-fueled instability in Egypt is cause for much greater worry.\nThis story \"Egypt Ups the Ante in Gaza, But What Are the Stakes?\" was written by Yossi Alpher.", "From 1998 to 2012, Penn State\u2019s share of the region\u2019s jobs jumped from 46 to 59 percent, CDT data show, while private industry slid from 28 to just seven percent. From 1994 to 2013, Penn State research expenditures jumped by $500 million while the region lost $500 million annually in private sector revenue.\n\u201cWhat would we do if Penn State went away?\u201d Erdley wonders in a question that might have seemed ludicrous before 2011 and the Sandusky scandal.\nPenn State now brings in about $1 billion annually in research dollars. But Erdley noted that research spending is expected to drop 3-5 percent each year, thanks to shifts in federal spending.\nSo how can the State College market avoid the economic troubles that have plagued other company towns when the cash cow stops giving milk?\nIt will be a mix of growth by existing companies and new commerce blood.\nErdley said one key is \u201cbuilding an entrepreneurial ecosystem\u201d \u2014 collaboration hubs, mentoring programs, enhanced infrastructure, a small-business loan program.\nThe local Centre Region Entrepreneurial Network, of which Erdley is a member, is planting the seeds for a small business surge.

The plan also includes recruiting Penn State alumni back to the area, and convincing graduate students to start their careers \u2014 or their businesses \u2014 here.\nSquier said the business community has reacted positively to 3B33, some enthusiastically asking how they can get involved, others at least waiting to see how things go.\nErdley is the chairman of the CBICC\u2019s entrepreneurship committee, and assembled what Squier called an \u201celite team\u201d of professionals with ties to Wall Street and Washington, D.C.\nThat group will need help.\nErdley, a one-time member of the Penn State Blue Band, longs for a harmonious local economy with the university, private industry and other areas contributing more evenly to a crescendo of shared success.", "On Sunday night, the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen hit a wedding party in Hajja province, killing up to 50 people. Strangely, no one in the Western media is calling for sanctions or regime change in Riyadh.\nIn fact, it seems they\u2019re not that concerned at all. This is despite the fact that Saudi Arabia has been repeatedly accused of indiscriminate bombing in Yemen during a military campaign which has brought 8 million civilians to the brink of famine.\nBy early evening on Monday, BBC News was displaying not one, not two, but five stories about the birth of Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s new baby boy. At the time of checking, there was no story at all about Yemen featured on the BBC\u2019s front page.\nCynical minds might suspect this is because the British government is party to the slaughter in Yemen through its selling of massive amounts of weapons to the Saudi government. In the BBC\u2019s piece on the attack, hidden seven stories down on the World News page, there was no mention at all of this relationship between London and Riyadh.\nSo I see that the (entire?) UK mainstream media has independently decided today not to write about the ongoing UK-backed slaughter in Yemen or UK backing/arming of Israel as it kills protesters. Because no-one tells them what to write, right?\nThe Guardian and the Independent gave more prominence to the Yemen story than the BBC, both displaying reports on the front pages of their websites \u2013 but the levels of outrage were seriously muted in comparison with the reaction to alleged attacks on civilians by the Syrian government.\nJournalists in the United States seem to be suffering from the same kind of selective outrage. A CNN story on the deaths in Yemen initially did not mention the words \u2018Saudi Arabia\u2019 until the seventh paragraph. The story was later updated to include news of the death of top Houthi leader Saleh al-Sammad, while the news about the deaths of up to 50 people at the wedding was knocked down to the fourth paragraph. This strange reluctance to be harsh on Riyadh or to give the Yemen war the prominence it deserves in the media, is clearly an effort to downplay atrocities which won't play as well in front of a Western audience. It's harder to play the role of the outraged anchor when you have to explain that the US signed an arms deal worth $110 billion with Saudi Arabia last year \u2013 a deal which included $7 billion worth of \u201cprecision weapons\u201d from Raytheon and Boeing.\nPerhaps if the White Helmets had shown up with a video camera and accusations of chemical weapons use, the story would have gotten more traction. Alas, it appears a gentler kind of bomb was used to kill the civilian victims. Reading the Western reports on Yemen, you get the sense that it is being reported out of duty, only to be buried somewhere and forgotten about the next day.\nIt remains to be seen whether UK Prime Minister Theresa May and the British press corps will issue a tough rebuke to Saudi Arabia following the most recent atrocity. Op-ed pieces about how the Saudi regime \u2018must go\u2019 are surely in the works as we speak.", "Within two years, the economy was in free fall, revenues were plummeting, and the state had begun to run up massive budget deficits.\nIt was not the first time that Capitol politicians had squandered a short-term spurt of revenues.

List the major problems facing Android?\nOK, another question. What can be done to fix this?\nI'm betting that you said little can be done. After all, Android is all about being open, which means that once Google has released a new version, the OEMs and carriers are free to tinker with it to their heart's content. That then results in both the fragmentation (OEMs loading the code onto any and every device form factor they can think of), and the problems with updates (Google can't push Android direct to devices because heavens knows what modifications and tinkering have been done, both cosmetic and structural, to the code).\nThe updates are a real sticking point. Apple can get a new release of iOS onto about 85 percent of devices in a year, while Google struggles to hit double-digit adoption in that time. And it takes about four years for a release to fully penetrate the ecosystem.\nFour years is a crazy long time in tech.\nSo, is the Android ecosystem destined to always be a mess?\n\"Whoa?!?!?!\" I hear you say. \"But isn't being open source a cornerstone to Android's success?\"\nIt was, but I don't think that's the case anymore.\nIn the early days, there's no doubt that Google needed the OEMs just as much as the OEMs needed Google, because building a quality smartphone was no trivial matter and Google needed the expertise that firms such as Samsung, LG, Motorola, and Sony could bring to the table. Now a firm like Foxconn can easily knock together a quality smartphone, and do it cheaper than the major OEMs can.\nAnd if you think that Google can't do this, well, they already are. As analyst Richard Windsor points out, much of the new stuff being added to Android doesn't go into the open source AOSP (Android Open Source Project) code base, but instead into Google Mobile Services.\nAnd, as Windsor points out, Google could point to its battle with Oracle as the catalyst for making the switch from open source to proprietary, if it needed an excuse.\nAnd a proprietary version of Android wouldn't mean the demise of handsets from the big names such as Samsung and LG and such. After all, Google could license them the ability to use the code just as it now licenses access to Google Mobile Services.\nAfter all, what would companies such as Samsung have to lose by switching from Android to a proprietary platform? OK, maybe a bit of freedom, but the advantages of being able to push updates to users, as well as reducing how much effort it has to put into customizing the code, would outweigh any of the downsides. Any maker who couldn't offer users quick access to updates would be skating on thin ice as soon as one competitor could offer that feature.\nAnd I don't see carriers complaining that much either. I know they like to customize and add their own branding/bloatware to Android, but they're hardly in a position to tell Google to take a hike.\nAnd Google could always build a mechanism into the OS that would allow both OEMs and carriers to customize and tweak the OS, without that affecting updates in any way.\nThere could be some other positive side effects for Google.\nThe first is that it would cut off companies like Amazon from having access to a free operating system. That would probably result in Amazon working on its own code, but it would add to its costs.\nThen, it could also mean that the patent licensing fees that Microsoft has negotiated with hardware makers, which pull in billions of dollars every year, would become moot. Sure, Google would no doubt have to come to some arrangement with Microsoft, but Google would be far less of a pushover than the hardware makers appear to have been, which could mean a reduction in how much Microsoft generates in fees.\nLicensing would give Google greater control over the hardware that Android was loaded onto. No more junk that can barely run the OS. No more devices being released running years-old releases with no hope of an update.\nIn short, Android has become a mess, and the landscape has changed such that there's no reason for Google to keep on making an open source operating system, especially one that the competition can leverage.", "Day 10 of Amazon's \"12 Days of Deals\" is all about the kitchen, with discounts on a KitchenAid stand mixer, the Instant Pot Ultra, Keurig coffee makers, and more.\nWe put together a list of our favorite discounts that make great gifts for home cooks.\nTo potentially save more on your holiday shopping, you can visit Business Insider Coupons to find up-to-date promo codes for a range of online stores.\nFor you and anyone else with holiday shopping to complete, Amazon's \"12 Days of Deals\" is not to be missed.\nToday, the company has slashed prices on a vast selection of kitchen appliances and cookware that consequently make great gifts.\nWe weeded through the deals and found 9 that are well worth your time and money, from the perennially popular KitchenAid stand mixer to the cult-favorite Instant Pot.

Charli is five and a half months pregnant, as a girl you just don't go out there alone and Nala wasn't with her,\" Kimberly said.\nNala is Scott's pitbull mix, who was found, alive and well at the Nahiku Marketplace along the Hana Highway and returned to Kimberly last night. The reunion was bittersweet.\n\"I know that Nala would not leave Charli if Charli was conscious, I know that. At first I thought that maybe she was in an accident -- but that can't be, that can't be now,\" Kimberly said, choking back tears.\nScott's dog Nala was found 20 miles southeast of the spot where she was last seen along the Hana Highway near mile marker 20 in Keanae.\nAccording to her ex-boyfriend, that's where she drove to help him after his car broke down Sunday. He reported to police she was following him back to Haiku -- but all of a sudden, she was gone.\nScott's car was found 20 miles in the opposite direction.\n\"They need to know who was around that vehicle. I'm assuming they need to look if it ran out of gas or if it's mechanically operating, and I'm assuming they need to look for blood or any signs of foul play,\" explained Kimberly.\nFamily members say they're holding on to hope Scott will be found safe and soon.\n\"Don't give up looking for her. The search plan has changed, it hasn't stopped. She still isn't found and now we know where the car is, so now we have to start looking all around here.

He reported to police that she was following him back to Haiku but all of a sudden, she was gone.\nCarly is 5 months pregnant. \"I can't find anything. I can't find her,\" says Kimberly Scott, \"Of course, I've got every worse nightmare running through my head.\"\nCapobianco is the father of the unborn child.

I mean I don't know... \" says Kimberly Scott.", "Since Richard Nixon famously called for an 'all-out offensive' on the war on drugs in 1971, the US government has funneled a trillion dollars into the effort.\nWhat does the nation have to show for the spoils of this war?\nAddiction rates have remained stable for the past decade, while over half the population in its federal prisons are entered for drug-related offenses.\nPerhaps the US war on drugs has failed because it fundamentally fails to understand addiction itself.\nRethinking our approach requires that we understand the experience of drug reward - the stimulus that gives one the appetite for the drug, and the role that context plays in the cycle of use.\nWhat exactly does context have to do with drug reward? The incredible high experienced in the use of drugs is boosted by the entire series of events and places that accompany such use: it is the feel and texture of the environment; it is the people who gave you the drugs; it is the feeling of ecstasy and jubilation that runs through you in their company.\nThe drugs and the context merge in the brain. Opioids, alcohol, and stimulants cause decidedly distinct patterns in the brain - except for one thing: they all activate the dopaminergic midbrain, a structure that plays a vital role in enhanced learning through reward. It is from here - when the alcohol hits, when the stimulant lands, when the opioid kicks in - that dopamine floods neural terminals into several key structures of the brain, signaling that whatever has just happened merits incredible importance. This reinforces that our previous actions must be repeated.\nResearch in modern neuroscience and psychology supports this view. The cues and contexts associated with drugs of abuse can trigger relapse in abstinent animals. And it all happens in the brain. The prefrontal cortex converts our internal goals into dynamic plans of action. From the moment the dopamine is released, the goal and the plan are rewarded. Addicts are addicted not just to the drug, but to the people they got it from and interacted with when taking it; they are addicted to the sensations provided by the environment, addicted to the plan.\nIndeed, studies show that among young people, interactions with peers who encourage use constitute a substantial risk factor for relapse, a problem made all the more difficult in the age of ubiquitous online sociality.\nOne region of the brain to receive that flood of dopamine is the amygdala, a center for the experience of emotional valence and arousal. The moment dopamine pours in, the emotional state present when taking the drug is reinforced, and the memory of the amazing high persists. Worse, research indicates that cells in the amygdala become even more active during abstinence and withdrawal, causing pangs of longing and distress for the pathological reward. What was initially the desire to get high can rapidly devolve into compulsive desperation - into a habitual state of behavior to avoid the misery of abstinence.\nNew insights into drug cravings illuminate just how profound the sensation is. The most susceptible animals will go through numerous shocks to obtain the drug. The pain that deters most of us from ruining our lives translates into an entirely suitable context for drug abuse to the particularly susceptible individual.\nWhat this finding, and others like it, make clear is that lawmakers are not neuroscientists. By way of proof, they have designed a war on drugs that fundamentally neglects our new insights into how the brain orchestrates addiction at its very core. Since addicts will go to incredible lengths to reinforce the contexts in which they consume drugs, we literally could not have devised a worse system, which reliably produces awful contexts to become addicted to. Taken together, what our new findings make clear is that the war on drugs reinforces the very criminal context it nominally aims to prevent.\nWhen we criminalize drugs and drug users, we ensure that the context of drug use habitually turns the brain toward shame, illegality, secrecy, and depravity. Do you know what else drives relapse to drugs of abuse? Stress and social isolation. We reinforce jails. We reinforce drug dealers. We reinforce violence. We reinforce the associated contexts of every other criminal enterprise that accommodates drug use. We habitually recreate a tragedy where the so-called solution causes the problem.\nYet we can't seem to kick the habit, no matter how much evidence of harm science reveals. It is time for us to take the first step and admit we need help, admit we have a problem. We are addicted to the war on drugs.\nIt could be that the best solutions come from countries like Portugal and the Netherlands, which have decriminalized drugs and legally administer them in treatment centers. From diminished drug abuse levels to fewer jail sentences and reduction in HIV transmission, such programs, in combination with humane treatment centres, have proven effective. But why? Perhaps because they accord with the psychological and neurological basis of context learning in addiction.\nWhile the US declares a war on drugs to prevent an environment of addiction, these countries instead cleverly seek to use the context of addiction to wage their fight. In a form of social and scientific ju-jitsu, decriminalization and humane treatment create a context of addiction that maximize the chances of breaking that addiction. The plan that got you there becomes the treatment centre's plan to monitor drug use for your transition to a drug-free life. If you use drugs in such a context, then this has a chance of becoming the new plan that the dopamine will reinforce.\nThe power of a humane, enriched and highly social environment stands out as one of the most proven preventatives for drug abuse in scientific literature. Animals in enriched social environments refrain from drug-seeking and drug relapse with astonishing consistency. Treatment based on these insights aligns most closely with our modern understanding of addiction.", "NIU runs for 168 yards in third quarter as legs of Harbison and Childers lead way.\nDeKALB \u2013 Toledo outrushed Northern Illinois in the first half, but the Huskies left no chance of that happening again in the second half of Wednesday\u2019s 38-15 win.\nAfter running for 83 yards in the first half, NIU (7-3, 6-0 Mid-American Conference) came out of the locker room with a 17-9 lead after halftime and ready to push the ball down the field between the tackles.\nOn 19 runs in the third quarter, NIU piled up 168 yards, as Toledo (5-5, 3-3) was pressed to go repeatedly to the air.\nNIU marched 69 yards in four plays on its third drive of the third quarter.\nThe drive was keyed by runs of 33 yards from running back Tre Harbison and 23 by quarterback Marcus Childers, the latter for a score.\nHarbison concluded the evening with 139 yards and Childers added 58 yards more to go with a 13-of-19, 131-yard passing game.\nNIU ran for 296 yards total. Marcus Jones added a late touchdown run of 44 yards with 3:18 left to cross the 100-yard rush mark as well.\n\"We thought Tre early in the game, and we told him this, was running a little high, maybe cutting before he had to,\" NIU coach Rod Carey said. \"In the second half, he was running with his pads down, always running forward, which is good.\"\nThe Huskies began gobbling up yards on their first drive of the second half on runs of 20 from Harbison, another carry of 10 from Childers and a 17-yard rush from Jones.\nNIU attempted only 11 plays and covered 82 yards as Childers pulled away from a fake handoff and waltzed into the end zone for a 24-9 NIU lead with 8:18 left in the third quarter.\n\"It's really our O-line and tight ends. They were moving guys,\" Harbison said. \"If you got a hole that big I feel anyone can run through those holes. They were playing relentless there out there.\"\nWith NIU leading by a point late in the second quarter, Sutton Smith rushed off the edge to block an attempted rugby-style punt, recovery and 27-yard touchdown for a 17-9 lead with 1:47 left in the first half.\nSmith\u2019s ninth sack of the season and forcing a fumble produced a Toledo punt that gave NIU possession on Toledo\u2019s half of the field late in the first quarter, leading to the Huskies\u2019 first score.\nNIU went on a five-play, 46-yard drive. Childers scrambled left out of the pocket on third down and hit Corey Lersch for a 33-yard score in which the tight end broke a tackle and rumbled 23 yards after the catch for a 7-3 Huskies lead wth 0:36 left in the first quarter.\nAfter a drive of 62 yards on 12 plays, the Huskies added on when Andrew Gantz\u2019 48-yard field goal sailed through the uprights.\nUndeterred, Toledo marched 75 yards in seven plays with Jon\u2019Vea Johnson\u2019s leaping, contested catch pulling the Rockets within one before Toledo\u2019s Jameson Vest missed the fifth extra point of his career.\nThe Huskies came up short of a first down on their opening drive when Harbison was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-1 from their own 44.\nOn Toledo\u2019s next possession, Peters completed a throw to a falling Cody Thompson on third-and-8 to the NIU 10-yard line. Peters completed only one of his next three passes as the Huskies held Toledo to a Vest 25-yard field goal.\nFacing another chance to score on its next possession after a Jauan Wesley catch and fumble and Justin Clark recovery, Vest pushed a 36-yard field goal wide right.\n\"Getting down to the red zone twice and coming away with just three points, I though that wasn't deflating, but it's a major moment in the game,\" Toledo coach Jason Candle said. \"You want to get seven points. You want to capitalize on those opportunities and we weren't able to.\"\nRepeatedly, the Huskies pressured Peters and despite coming up with only one sack in the first half, ended the night with five, led by Jack Heflin bullrushing his way to 2.5 sacks.\nAt near even in yardage, Toledo outgained NIU, 222-218, and was 6 of 12 on third down, but field position and the blocked punt made all plenty difference for the Huskies.\nToledo tacked on a late score with 3:27 left on a 1-yard run by Shakif Seymour.", "British pubs are closing at the rate of 39 a week, and we now have more supermarkets than pubs, which seems so disturbing that if I met anybody who welcomed the development I\u2019d be tempted to hit them. The causes, I admit, are complex and probably irreversible. They include the narrow margins the pub lessees are required to operate under by the pubcos (we\u2019re already in hell, as you can tell); the smoking ban; the preference for eating out over drinking, and for wine over beer; the cheapness of supermarket booze; and the government\u2019s beer duty escalator, set last year to rise at 2 per cent above inflation annually until 2012 and unlikely to be revoked in the Budget in spite of increasing pressure from MPs.\nAlistair Darling said the escalator would provide revenue to help the old and the poor \u2013 a provocative remark, given that these are the very people most likely to make use of the traditional British pub. But I should have known from those periodic photographs of Tony Blair queasily sipping pints while supposedly bonding with his constituents in Sedgefield that the government I voted for would do nothing to help the Dog and Duck, and I don\u2019t believe Gordon Brown is any more of a pub man.\nThe beer duty escalator is, in reality, a capitu\u00adlation to the health lobby, whose concerns over binge drinking are all too well founded. But these binge drinkers are not pub goers in the sense that most British men \u2013 if not many New Labour ministers \u2013 have been for two centuries. If someone cut up rough in the pubs of my young manhood, the place would fall silent, and he would be on the end of a dozen censorious stares. If he slurred and stumbled when ordering a drink, then the landlord, whom he probably knew and liked, would gently advise him to go home. But it wouldn\u2019t come to that. The old-style pub was full of professional drinkers, so to speak, and the ability to hold one\u2019s booze was highly prized.\nBinge drinking comes from rootlessness in every sense. Alcohol provides an escape from the anomie that is the defining condition of corporatised, globalised, urban Britain, and if it can be consumed in the depths of some pounding lager depot, then no limits apply. A still faster way to oblivion is to buy cheap beer from the supermarkets, which use alcohol as a loss leader, and can readily absorb the beer duty. It is now being argued, by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) among others, that the duty should be frozen on beer sold in pubs, as these are valuable community hubs. But the government, in its priggish way, appears to want to make schools the hubs of communities. Ministers are blind to the natural foci \u2013 post offices and pubs.\nIf, as a journalist, I am sent on an assignment to any British town, I go into a pub to take the temperature of the place. I inveigle myself into a conversation with drinkers at the bar. Note those terms \u201cdrinkers\u201d and \u201cbar\u201d. You can\u2019t so readily talk to people eating at tables in pubs. Food pubs are much more atomised places, lacking the correct pub dynamic. Most decent British pubs are now driven to attract what one landlord I know wearily calls \u201cthe grey brigade\u201d: genteel, retired folk, who will motor out to a pub for a pint and fish and chips for him, a tagliatelle with pesto and a white wine for her. Having consumed this, they immediately go home, giving a staccato rhythm to pub life.\nReaders, especially female readers, might detect a misogynistic note in this article. I am on difficult ground here. After all, the president of CAMRA is a woman. But I liked the male orientation of pubs. It was an antidote to married life, and I could appreciate that from the atmosphere of a pub even before I was married. Pubs tended to be dark, a troglodytic refuge. This was off-putting to women, but I like dark places. I look much better in the dark, for one thing. And given the high divorce rate, and the crisis of masculinity caused by the deindustrialisation of Britain, I would have thought we needed more rather than fewer places where men can socialise together.\nThis article appears in the 20 April 2009 issue of the New Statesman, Who polices our police?", "Film-maker Lennie Little-White is adding another volume to his portraits of Jamaicans who have distinguished themselves is various fields of endeavour.\nHaving produced two documentaries on cultural icon and scholar the late Professor Rex Nettleford, as well as similar works with national heroes Paul Bogle and George William Gordon; artist Barrington Watson and former prime minister PJ Patterson as the subjects, Little-White is moving is moving on to his next project, Jamaica's first female prime minister Portia Simpson Miller.\n\u201cWhen you consider the heights that Mrs Simpson Miller reached and what she achieved in her life as a public servant, which culminated with her tenure as prime minister, this is something that should be celebrated,\u201d Little-White told the Jamaica Observer.\n\u201cLet's just look at the fact that this young girl from Wood Hall in St Catherine, who didn't attend St Andrew or Immaculate High Schools, could navigate her way through the quagmire of politics, which is such a male bastion. Then there are the criticisms of race and social background which she had to face, yet she achieved what no other female had done in history. This needs to be celebrated in as big a way as is possible,\u201d he added.\nThe team is currently deep into the research and pre-production with Little-White scheduled to sit with the former prime minister in the coming weeks to get her input and perspective. He is projecting a February 2019 release date.\n\u201cMrs Simpson Miller wants the film to reflect as much of her as is possible. For her a particular feature must be its ability to reach the man and woman in the street. It will be a film with some areas being dramatised, but for the most part [it] will utilise documentary techniques to bring the story of this warrior woman who took on the odds and beat them \u2014 Portia Simpson Miller's journey \u2014 from her perspective. Everybody should be able to find something in this piece to relate to; whether they are watching it on local television or YouTube, JLP or PNP, or you reside in Jamaica, Trinidad, Japan or the United States. One of the things that is important to her is that young people find it to be a source of inspiration. They must watch and walk away with the feeling that they can accomplish whatever they put their minds to. This is very important to Mrs Simpson Miller,\u201d Little-White explained.\nThe docufilm, which is titled Journey, will also feature what Little-White described as a \u201csmorgasbord of testimonials from local and international personalities\u201d, who are currently being filmed. The production schedule sees the months of December into January dedicated to editing and mixing, ahead of the February release, chosen to coincide with the celebration of Black History Month.\nHe has hopes of similar projects with prime ministers Shearer, Manley, Seaga and Golding. But first he wants to wrap up discussions with the family of folklorist Louise Bennett-Coverley to obtain certain rights and information to before moving ahead with a project dedicated to her life and work.\nLittle-White pointed out that his series of portraits on film is his contribution to the documenting of Jamaica's history.", "INDIANAPOLIS \u2013 Sometimes the oft-talked about \u201cextra pass\u201d is a good thing. Sometimes making one more pass frees up a teammate for a clean look. Other times, though, it can be just what its name implies. Extra. Superfluous.\nSo far this season, coach Nate McMillan said, Tyreke Evans has struggled to distinguish between when he needs to get rid of the ball and when he should look for his own shot. Instead, he\u2019s playing as though he\u2019s predetermined what he\u2019s going to do before the play unfolds.\nDuring this week\u2019s rare break \u2013 four consecutive days without a game \u2013 in what is otherwise a frenetic NBA schedule, McMillan and Evans sat down to go over tape and discuss Evans\u2019 first 14 games in a Pacers uniform; in which he's averaged a disappointing 10.3 points, 2.2 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. Together, they reached the conclusion that the reason Evans hasn\u2019t resembled the playmaker he was last year in Memphis largely is because he\u2019s not relying heavily enough on his instincts.\n\u201cYou know, we talk a lot about ball movement, and sometimes you\u2019re moving the ball because you\u2019re talking about it, and (don\u2019t take) a wide open shot,\u201d McMillan said following Thursday\u2019s practice at St. Vincent Center. \u201cPlay basketball. Make your reads out on the floor. When you have open looks, take those open looks. Shoot it with confidence and don\u2019t get caught up in thinking too much out there and becoming robotic.\nSo does team leader and all-star Victor Oladipo, who jokingly told Evans recently to stop trying to be John Stockton.\nThat one made Evans laugh. \u201cThat guy is a legend, so I guess I\u2019ll take it as compliment,\u201d Evans chuckled.\nAll kidding aside, Evans knows more is expected of him. Though he is shooting a solid \u2013 if unspectacular \u2013 36.6 percent from beyond the arc, his effective field goal percentage sits at a paltry 46 percent, worst among all Pacers regulars and 311th out of nearly 400 players who have played at least 10 games and average 15-plus minutes.\nAnd it\u2019s not just his scoring numbers than have taken a dip since last season with Memphis. Evans' rebounds, assists, points and free throws per 36 minutes have all dropped significantly. Evans attributes his early struggles to a slower-than-he'd-hoped-for adjustment to his new surroundings and role. In eight of his previous nine NBA seasons, Evans had averaged at least 28.2 minutes per game. So far this season, he's playing fewer than 20 per outing.\nTo be clear, Evans is not complaining about his playing time, but there's no denying it's an adjustment in how much time he's being allotted to get into rhythm. He's also still adapting to playing for the Pacers. As he has said on multiple occasions since arriving in Indianapolis, the Pacers are an organization unlike any he\u2019s ever played with before.\nRight now, he\u2019s still learning how to fit in.\nThat\u2019s not an unnatural feeling, even for a veteran, in a new town, Darren Collison said. It\u2019s also not unnatural for the tentativeness of a new teammate or two to become contagious as the old guard tries to learn how to work new pieces into their puzzle.\nThat time is coming, said Doug McDermott, the second of the Pacers' major offseason acquisitions. Like Evans, he too has yet to make the type of impact that McMillan and Pacers president Kevin Pritchard envisioned when they brought him on board. The sharpshooter is averaging just 5.2 points per game despite connecting on better than 42 percent of his 3-point attempts.\nMcDermott is also playing fewer minutes than he has in some time (15.2 per game). And when he's on the court, he's launching fewer shots than ever \u2014 4.2 attempts per 36 minutes is the lowest of his career.\nBut McDemott isn't worried about getting more shots. When the second unit becomes more comfortable playing together, the opportunities for him to shoot will come.\n\"In that first unit, the continuity is there. It\u2019s good,\" said McDermott, who has played on five teams since 2016 and has become accustomed to having to learn new systems. \"Our second unit is still trying to click. We're still trying to figure ourselves out a little. ... It usually takes 20-25 games before you really feel comfortable out there with your guys. We\u2019re still a work in progress. The good news is, we got a pretty solid record (8-6), and now we're home for a few games in a row and start to get a little rhythm to the season.\"", "Looking to draw a bit more attention, 72Lux, based in New York, introduced on Wednesday a new platform called Shoppable for Merchants that lets e-retailers selling most any type of product market their wares on publishers\u2019 Web pages. This marks a new approach for 72Lux, which previously developed a white-label platform for selling high-end apparel and beauty products on health, exercise, and lifestyle content sites.\nShoppable for Merchants can be used by anyone with an e-commerce site\u2014such as an Etsy or Shopify store\u2014to market, distribute, and sell products to a vaster audience. Using a self-serve method, merchants upload details about their products to the platform, which runs on websites that belong to content publishers in 72Lux\u2019s network. Publishers that host Shoppable for Merchants earn commissions on the product sales. By opening up the categories to include children\u2019s apparel, gadgets, books, and other items, Marie hopes to expand upon the more than 23,000 brands already in her company\u2019s catalog.\nFounded in 2011, 72Lux is an alum of accelerators 500 Startups and First Growth Venture Network. In July, Marie was named one of this year\u2019s Women in Digital by L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA, an award given by the company to three women founders of tech startups who get the chance to pilot their ideas with the cosmetics brand.\nThe advent of Shoppable for Merchants, with its self-serve systems will free up 72Lux to work more with midsize and smaller online merchants, Marie says. \u201cPrior to the launch, it would take just as long for us to set up a partnership with The Sharper Image or Best Buy as it would to setup someone that had just one product to sell,\u201d she says. That forced 72Lux to focus on working first with larger merchants while some of the little guys waited to be integrated into the system. Marie believes the new platform will give her company more flexibility to serve a broader swath of merchants. \u201cOur large goal is to make any type of content Shoppable,\u201d she says.", "Industry leaders including Gautam Adani, Anand Mahindra, Anil Agarwal, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and Sanjiv Puri felt issues relating to farmers, unorganised sector workers and middle class were addressed without 'risking bankruptcy of the economy'. Budget came as a balancing act of populism with a pragmatic approach in an election year considering both \"hosh and josh\".\nNEW DELHI: India Inc on Friday termed the Modi government's last Budget as a balancing act of populism with a pragmatic approach in an election year, taking into consideration both \"hosh and josh\".\nIndustry leaders including Gautam Adani, Anand Mahindra, Anil Agarwal, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and Sanjiv Puri felt issues relating to farmers, unorganised sector workers and middle class were addressed without 'risking bankruptcy of the economy'.\nIt is \"an 'election year' Budget that expectedly has something for everyone, from farmers to traders, workers in unorganised sector to the salaried middle class\", Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said.\nShe said the government did well to balance the populist tone by signalling its commitment to stick to the road of fiscal discipline.\n\"India's middle class, small traders and farmers are the lifelines of its economic growth. By catering to these ambitions #Budget2019 infuses hopes for millions of dreams,\" Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani tweeted.\nExpressing similar views, Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra said in a tweet, \"I was bracing for a populist, profligate budget driven by 'election panic.' I'm just grateful that the reliefs to the key middle class & farmer segments were delivered in a measured way without risking bankruptcy of the economy. This was a controlled, pump-priming exercise...\"\nRPG Enterprises chairman Harsh Goenka termed the announcements in the Budget as \"a volley of sixes, a victory for farmers and middle-class, two major pillars of our economy\".\nHe further said, \"Balancing both hosh and josh, the Budget will stimulate consumption demand and alleviate lives in rural areas...\"\n\"The Narendra Modi government must be applauded for a pro-growth and fiscally prudent budget for the financial year 2019-20 without putting the exchequer's finances under too much pressure,\" Vedanta Resources Executive chairman Anil Agarwal said.\nDalmia Cement (Bharat) MD and CEO Mahendra Singhi said the key highlight of the Budget was benefits to empower the rural and agro economy.\n\"The measures announced in the Budget are likely to provide a significant impetus to consumption spending in the economy, which will boost growth in the near to medium term,\" CII president Rakesh Bharti Mittal said.\nAnother industry body Assocham said the interim Budget appears to be a good one with a mix of populist and pragmatic statements.\n\"The announced tax breaks, together with low average inflation, are likely to spur domestic demand and spending, and inject liquidity in the market. This is great news for sectors such as hospitality and travel,\" OYO Hotels and Homes Founder & Group CEO Ritesh Agarwal said.\nApollo Hospitals Group chairman Prathap C Reddy termed it a forward-thinking budget with a definitive vision to accelerate much greater progress and enhance wellbeing of Indians.\n\"It is a progressive budget that addresses both the current challenges being faced by the economy as well as presents an outline of the vision the government has for the future of India ten years ahead,\" Ficci president Sandeep Somany said.\nPHDCCI president Rajeev Talwar said the budget deserves 9.5 points out of 10 on creating a dynamic, promising and confidence-building environment. \"India would continue to need more structural, policy and economic reforms to become a $5 trillion economy in the next five years. There is a considerable ground to be covered and this Budget has set the tone for future discourse,\" Shyamal Mukherjee, chairman, PwC India.\n\"An interim budget with clear focus on long-term fundamentals along with targeted proposals crucial to address the current economic, political and social situation. Right from the farmer, to unorganised sector workers to middle class tax payer, everyone would have something to cheer upon,\" BDO India Partner M&A Tax Suraj Malik said.\nMagma Fincorp Ltd vice-chairman and managing director Sanjay Chamria said, \"A middle class budget with a rural focus is what the government has delivered in an election year.\"\nICICI Lombard General Insurance MD & CEO Bhargav Dasgupta termed it a progressive budget that aims at uplifting India's populace.\nEssar Capital director Prashant Ruia said it was a good budget in that it is aimed at spurring consumption and creating demand that is sustainable.\nSAIL chairman A K Chaudhary said, \"The budget announcement for industry as a whole looks positive. The development of infrastructure in the country has been given further emphasis in this interim budget as well. Sectors like railways, roadways and waterways remain the focus areas of growth.\"\nBudget allocation for expanding the railway infrastructure, improving connectivity through Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and scaling up the Sagar Mala project are all indications for more steel consumption in the country, he said.\nSameer Kochhar, chairman, SKOCH Group, said, \"The announcement of schemes such as Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojna, Shramyogi Maan-dhan Yojna and hike in MNREGA from Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore will definitely be a step forward in ensuring the upliftment of the weaker sections of the society.\"", "SINGAPORE - Large parts of Singapore from Bedok to Jurong were hit by a blackout early on Tuesday morning (Sept 18), affecting close to 150,000 residential and commercial customers.\nAffected residents said their homes were plunged into darkness, while some motorists navigated roads without streetlights.\nThe Energy Market Authority (EMA) said it is investigating the blackout.\nEnergy utilities provider SP Group said in a statement that electricity was disrupted in 19 areas in the country at 1.18am and the supply was restored within 38 minutes.\nThe disruption was due to a partial loss of electricity supply from two power generation companies, SP said, based on its preliminary findings. It added that investigations are ongoing and that its electricity network is in order, following checks.\nSP said that 146,797 residential and commercial customers were affected in the following areas: Boon Lay, Choa Chu Kang, Clementi, Jurong, Pandan Loop, Aljunied, Geylang, Tanjong Rhu, Mountbatten, Kembangan, Bedok, East Coast, Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Thomson, Mandai, Admiralty, Sembawang and Woodlands.\nWhen the electricity was cut off, Singaporeans started sharing their experiences on social media despite the late hour.\nMr Tan Boon Tong, 37, who works in healthcare, told The Straits Times that he was at his Housing Board flat in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 when the lights and fans suddenly went out.\n\"My mother was in the living room watching television and it suddenly went off. So I went out to check, and the neighbourhood was in total darkness,\" he said.\nAnother affected resident, Ms Jaxy Yeo, 27, who works in sales, said she initially thought that the electricity in her Westwood Road home in Jurong had tripped.\n\"My entire house was dark. We thought that something might have tripped the power. But when I looked out, the entire estate was pitch black,\" she said.\nMs Adeline Ng, who is in her 60s, said that she was almost stuck in the lift at her home in Central Grove condominium in Geylang.\n\"I was taking the lift down to go to a nearby coffee shop... I thought it was just a lift problem and pressed the emergency button. Luckily, the door opened and I quickly got out, and had to walk down the stairs in darkness,\" she said.\nThe power outage affected street lights as well.\nPhotographer Aaron Rodrigues, 25, said the lights along the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) and traffic lights were hit by the blackout. He was driving from Nanyang Technological University to his home in Yishun at around 1.40am.\n\u201cThe lights were already off when I entered the expressway, but there were traffic cones placed along the PIE entrance, so this helped cars that came onto the expressway filter in without any trouble,\" he said.\n\u201cI drove very slowly with the high beam lights on. It was like driving along a Malaysian highway at night; you just have to go slow.\"\n\u201cAt the traffic light junctions, it was amazing how everyone stopped from different directions. I stopped a bit longer to appreciate it because I have never seen people being so considerate while driving.\"\nMarine Parade GRC MP Tan Chuan-Jin, who is Speaker of Parliament, posted on his Facebook page that the blackout seemed to be \"quite a serious and extensive\" one.\nHe said that the hotlines were clogged up with calls, so affected Singaporeans might find it hard to get through. \u201cStay calm. The agencies are doing what they can,\u201d he added.\nSP said in a Facebook post that its officers were deployed to the affected areas and it is investigating the incident.\nThe Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force said on Facebook at around 2.45am that their emergency services were operating normally, and advised the public to contact them at 999 and 995 respectively only in emergencies.\nThe EMA said in its statement: \"The EMA takes a serious view of disruptions to Singapore's electricity supply. We will review the outcome of our investigation before deciding on the actions to take.\"\nIt added that it would work with the industry to put in place measures to minimise the risk of similar incidents happening in the future.\n\"We thank the public for their patience and understanding while efforts were made to restore electricity supply,\" the EMA added.\nThe last major blackout in Singapore was on June 1, where thousands of people in the Central Business District were left without power for half an hour in the afternoon.\nThe outage hit the Raffles Place area and included parts of Chinatown. Banks, traffic lights, food centres and at least one shopping mall were affected, while offices were plunged into darkness.\nSP Group said on June 4 that the blackout was caused by maintenance work by the crew at a substation.\nIn 2011, a contractor was fined $150,000 after it damaged a high-voltage electricity cable, leading to a 15-minute blackout in the Bishan and Ang Mo Kio area.\nApart from affecting homes and businesses in the area, the power failure also stalled trains between Orchard and Marsiling, causing delays for more than 7,000 commuters.", "ENGLEWOOD \u2014 Gary Kubiak is full of faith in one young quarterback and hope in another.\nThe Denver Broncos coach is optimistic Trevor Siemian can return to the lineup this weekend and trusts that rookie Paxton Lynch has a bright future despite his shaky start Sunday at Jacksonville.\nLynch completed just a dozen passes \u2014 only two after halftime \u2014 for 104 yards and converted just one of 13 first downs. But he didn\u2019t turn the ball over like he had in his first start against Atlanta in Week 5, when he threw an interception and fumbled twice.\nLynch, who\u2019s still learning how to play under center, make progressions in the passing game and call plays in the huddle \u2014 things he didn\u2019t do much at the University of Memphis \u2014 struggled mostly with his accuracy. But his ball protection allowed Denver\u2019s defense and special teams to lead the way to a 20-10 victory that put them back in the playoff picture at 8-4.\nAlthough Denver managed just 206 yards of offense, its defense forced three turnovers and punter Riley Dixon averaged 46 yards on 11 punts, accounting for 506 yards. Dixon\u2019s 41.4-yard net punting average is the highest by any rookie in NFL history.\nSiemian sat out Sunday with a left mid-foot sprain he suffered in overtime of Denver\u2019s loss to Kansas City a week earlier. He spent a few days last week in a walking boot but was out of it by the weekend and showed no noticeable limp in the locker room Monday.\nThe true test comes Wednesday if he\u2019s cleared to practice, to see if he can move around in the pocket.\nThe Broncos\u2019 playoff hopes could rest on that answer.\nTheir next four opponents have a combined .729 winning percentage. No one in the NFL has a tougher schedule to finish out the season than the Broncos, who visit AFC South co-leader Tennessee (6-6) on Sunday.\nSiemian had his best game as a pro, 368 yards passing, three touchdowns and no interceptions, against the Chiefs, just the kind of step-it-up performance Kubiak challenged him to deliver in Denver\u2019s stretch run. But he hurt his foot on a sack in overtime and Lynch was up again.\nPlaying behind a porous O-line, Siemian hasn\u2019t been able to stay healthy. He bruised his throwing shoulder in the preseason and sustained a bruised left A.C. joint in Week 4. He missed six quarters and was bothered by that injury until the bye week. Then, he got hurt again.\nThe coaching staff last week modified the offense to fit Lynch\u2019s skills and grasp of the playbook, putting him in the shotgun and moving him around. It\u2019s just that his throws were off-target.\nKubiak seemed taken aback by questions this week about Lynch\u2019s long-term future in the NFL.\n\u201cOh God, I think this guy\u2019s got a brilliant career ahead of him,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited. We\u2019re asking a lot of him. \u2026 He\u2019s a young kid, but I\u2019m excited about some of the things I see and I\u2019m also excited about things I know we can correct that are going to help him out.", "It was a typical morning at the start of the school day: Breakfast was being served at the Chardon High School cafeteria when the deadly pops began in the hallway of the small-town Ohio campus.\n\"Everybody just started running,\u201d Megan Hennessy, 17, told the Associated Press. Hennessy said she was in class when she heard the noises. \"Everyone was running and screaming down the hallway.\"\nAt least one student died and four others were injured when a gunman opened fire in the school, according to officials who were still sorting through the evidence, seeking a motive.\nThe dead student was later identified as Daniel Parmertor by his family.\n\"We are shocked by this senseless tragedy,\" his family said in a prepared statement distributed to reporters. \"Danny was a bright young boy who had a bright future ahead of him. The family is torn by this loss. We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time.\"\nA student was in custody in the case, but has not been identified because of his age, officials said. He has not yet been charged, they said.\nMedia interviews with witnesses and survivors painted a picture of students preparing for the start of their school week, then thrown into the chaos of flight by the ominous popping sounds that came first from the hallway, where officials said the shooter opened fire with a handgun.\nThe shots were then heard in the cafeteria, according to one witness, Heather Ziska, 17.\nZiska told reporters she was in the cafeteria when she and other students heard the popping noises in the hall. She said she saw a boy she recognized as a fellow student come into the cafeteria and start shooting. She said she and others sought safety outside while some friends ran into a nearby middle school and others locked themselves in a teachers lounge.\nIt was unclear whether the gunman had specific targets in mind when he began shooting. Freshman Danny Komertz told the AP that he believed the gunman was looking for certain students. He said he saw one student dive under a cafeteria table to unsuccessfully hide.\nKomertz described the shooter as an outcast who had apparently been bullied by others. Officials would not discuss the motive.\nJonathan Sylak, a senior, told MSNBC that he sought shelter in the school library. He said a teacher pushed a chair up against the door as a barricade to prevent the gunman from entering.\nInside, he said, students reached for their smartphones but they were unable to get any texts out because of the volume of calls.\nThe school had staged evacuation drills before, Sylak said, and \"we knew this wasn\u2019t a drill.\"\nA teacher chased the gunman out of the building after the shootings, officials said.

Many of us have been waiting with bated breath for Watercool's entry into the Threadripper cooling market, and it finally is with the HEATKILLER IV Pro. We compare it to five other water blocks.\nWatercool has a very big following in both Europe and the United States. It builds and designs all its enthusiast water cooling products in Germany. Watercool's design and execution are apparent the moment you hold its product in your hand. Watercool manufactures water blocks for CPUs and GPUs as well as motherboard power components and all sorts of heat exchangers, radiators, and fittings.\nThe product we are reviewing today is the Watercool HEATKILLER IV PRO for Threadripper. We have previously had no relationship with Watercool, but HardOCP readers suggested that we review its Threadripper block, so we reached out to Watercool and asked for a sample. It took us a while to get it in hand, since Watercool had the audacity to put us behind its paying customers in terms of priority! Of course I am kidding. It is nice to see a company put its customers first. Heck, there are even some enthusiast water cooling companies out there, that will sell you a product that does not perform as it should, apologize for that, and instead of letting you return the product and get your money back, they give you a $25 coupon on your next purchase. Remember, vote with your wallet.\nThe main feature of the block is the completely new cooling structure that is perfectly adjusted to the specific Threadripper package. Instead of simply extending the cold plate, we developed a completely new and unique water block. For example, the cooling structure is more than 80% larger than that of a regular HEATKILLER IV PRO. Flow and bleeding characteristics were also optimized. All these features let the HEATKILLER IV PRO for Threadripper block become a true performance monster!\nBelow is our unboxing and breakdown video that we did last week. It is a quick 7 minute look of what is in the box and we take the block apart to show you exactly what the design looks like on the inside. One thing worth noting in the video is the hex key tool that comes with the kit. I did a lot of cleaning and organizing around the office in the last week, and it seems as though I lost the included tool, so the only place it is shown, is in the video below.\nThe packaging that the HEATKILLER IV PRO comes in is, well, for lack of a better term, ugly. However, what we truly look for in a box is if our hardware arrived perfectly intact, which it did.\nThese are a couple of pictures of the HEATKILLER IV installed on our ASUS ROG STRIX X399E Gaming motherboard using Corsair \"AM4\" RAM.\nThe Watercool block is very utilitarian in its design, which I very much appreciate. There is truly nothing included in the this block's design that is not \"needed,\" beside the Frag Harder Disco Lights, but of course everything computer oriented on the planet has to have that now. Thankfully, those are easily removed as we show in the video above. We generally remove these for temperature testing as these blocks are easier to deal with without RGB pigtails getting in the way.", "Paris\t- Newborns of fathers 45 and older are more likely to be underweight or wind up in intensive care, researchers reported Thursday, adding to the list of problems associated with older dads.\nAlter Bridge front-man Myles Kennedy released his breakthrough solo album \"Year of the Tiger\" on March 9 via Napalm Records.\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Ted Ligety chatted with Digital Journal about his partnership with J.M.

I have the patience for puppies, but that's a quick stage!\"\nAnd the 'A Wrinkle In Time' actress doesn't feel as though she's missed out on being a mother, because she believes she is \"a mother to the world's children.\"\nShe added previously: \"When people were pressuring me to get married and have children, I knew I was not going to be a person that ever regretted not having them, because I feel like I am a mother to the world's children.\n\"Love knows no boundaries. It doesn't matter if a child came from your womb or if you found that person at age two, 10 or 20. If the love is real, the caring is pure and it comes from a good space, it works.\"", "FIFA\u2019s councillors have voted unanimously to expand the World Cup finals from 32 to 48 teams.\nWell, of course they did. It will bring the member associations they represent a lot more money.\nThere will be 16 more games, which means more content for broadcasters but also an increase to the value of broadcast rights. FIFA estimates this could be an increase of over $1 billion worldwide. My feeling is it will be more than that.\nAn 80-game tournament, as opposed to a 64-game one, will also justify higher sponsorship fees.\nMore games means higher gate takings for the tournament.\nSixteen more countries will benefit from prize money just for qualifying.\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino was elected last year and promised to bring in more money for FIFA member nations. Reading from the playbook of Joao Havelange and Sepp Blatter, he courted the numerous developing nations.\nThey voted for him and this is payback time. One can safely assume that upon taking office, Infantino looked at the books and didn\u2019t like what he saw. So he thought, the World Cup is FIFA\u2019s big cash cow so let\u2019s make it a bigger cash cow.\nYet even last week Infantino, with a straight face, said this decision should not be about money but about football. Sure.\nPrior to the vote, much of Europe opposed the move, in particular the European Clubs Association. They would, of course. The Europeans, and to some extent the South Americans, have always opposed changes which may dilute their hegemony of the tournament.\nThere is also the legitimate view that the additional teams, most of whom will hail from the developing world, will reduce the quality of the football. Even FIFA admits to this risk.\nThe expanded format will not be attractive to travelling fans. One travel agent told me this week that he doesn\u2019t fancy trying to sell World Cup packages when the Socceroos could be eliminated after just two games.\nThe proposed format of 16 groups of three teams and then straight knock-out rounds thereafter is clever in two ways: it doesn\u2019t lengthen the tournament in duration, remaining 32-days long, and it doesn\u2019t require the eventual finalists to play more than the seven games required under the 32-team format.\nAlso, mercifully, it won\u2019t require the host nation to build more stadiums than it does now.\nThe main upside, according to the New York Times , is that an expanded format will make the event more global and will guarantee higher participation from outside Europe and South America.\nThis upside favours Australia too. A larger World Cup should mean qualification will be easier. However, be prepared for a qualifying campaign without the drama and entertainment we have come to love since the Socceroos move into the Asian Football confederation.\nThis is a worry. The tougher it is to qualify, in other words the fewer places available, the more thrilling the qualifying process between World Cups. And the qualifying process is as much part of the World Cup\u2019s magic as the finals themselves.\nOf course, the devil will be in the detail.\nStill to be decided is how the three-way group matches will be decided. The idea of drawn matches being split by a penalty shootout has been floated.\nJoint hosting, once a no-no for FIFA, is back on the agenda and rightly so. There are not too many countries in the world capable, geographically and economically, to host a 48-team World Cup by themselves.\nAnd then there is how and where the additional 16 places will be allocated. On this, too, FIFA has not yet made a decision.\nStand by for a period a feverish lobbying and counter-lobbying from the confederations demanding to maximise their quotas.\nIf you thought FIFA was political, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.", "Join the Park Services Specialist for the First Day Hike and observe what life is like on the wild side.

In Short Term 12, Destin Daniel Cretton's low-key, high-emotion indie about a foster-care facility for at-risk teens, there are periodic efforts to escape. A breakout, a crazed tear across the scruffy lawn, and once they're beyond the gate, they can't be touched. Gone.\nA pair of attempted getaways bookend Short Term 12, but it's what happens in between that really matters. This is a film about hurt and healing, isolation and fear, need and rage - and it's not just the motley, messed-up crew of 14- and 15-year-olds who are trying to cope, trying to get better.\nGrace, the facility supervisor, may seem like she's got it all together - a cool, twentysomething caregiver who acts more like an older sister to these adolescents than an authority figure. But she has her issues. They run silent and deep.\nBrie Larson gives a career-defining performance as Grace; the actress has this woman down, from the beat-up bike she rides to and from work to the beat-up look in her eyes, which she hides with an outsized empathy. Grace lives with, and works with, Mason (a very good John Gallagher Jr.), who is rightly in awe of his partner's strength, her priorities, her instincts, her goofy humor.\nWhen a new staffer, Nate (Rami Malek), shows up for his first week on the job, we get to see the facility, how it operates, and who its residents are - and the challenges its young team of overseers faces. There is good reason there are no scissors, razors, belts allowed.\nIn lesser hands, Short Term 12 could have been the stuff of an afterschool special, a Lifetime TV melodrama, with its walking-case studies of drug addiction, sexual abuse, violence, eating disorders, and self-mutilation. But the kids Cretton has cast display few signs of effort, of overdoing it.\nAlex Calloway's Sammy - a skinny teen lost in his fantasy world of dolls and plush toys - feels terribly right. Keith Stanfield is brooding and intense as Marcus, about to be released from care because he is turning 18. And Kaitlyn Dever as Jaden, a new intake with special privileges, bristles with loathing - and self-loathing.\nGrace's efforts to connect with Jaden become pivotal to the narrative, revealing as much about her own history as it does about her scowling, goth-girl charge.\nShort Term 12 is full of telling detail (the pencil smudges on Grace's wrist, from her drawing sessions with Mason - perfect!) and full of compassion for its characters. It has heart, and heartbreak. And because it is so committed to getting these things, and these people, right, the movie leaves you feeling not depressed or despairing, but inspired. That's not a bad trick.\nDirected by Destin Cretton. With Brie Larson, Frantz Turner, John Gallagher Jr., and Kaitlyn Dever. Distributed by Cinedigm.", "Visions for Australian society and economy: what makes a 'Good Society' and should such a thing be measured in purely material terms?\nTristan's careful article is unlikely to get terribly many responses because it lacks rhetorical arrogance and doesn't make bold conjectures.\nMost people will find the cautious, pragmatic, \"a little from column 'A', a little from colum 'B'\" approach quite agreeable.\na) Public income is best derived from natural resource rents (e.g., land tax, mineral royalties, spectrum fees etc) and taxes on labour and capital should be reduced to a minimum. Such an approach is beneficial for the environment as it discourages waste, takes off the onerous fetters on production and is just insofar that a person owns the result of their labour and investment and prevents rent-seeking monopolies.\n2) The degree of efficious public ownership or regulation is dependent on a function of the relative necessity of the good or service (and as such the elasticity of demand) and the potential to develop positive (or negative) externalities. The more than a good is a genuine commodity with discrete benefits the less the government should be involved.\nI support the \"a little from column A, a little from column B\" approach. It is indeed a case for just about all of the parameters that matter, that they be a balance of competing interests rather than polarised positions.\nThe wrong sort of planning can render a city (and a society) somewhat sterile and bland. But I don\u2019t think we can have too much of the right sort of planning. The right planning regime could help ensure a high level of dynamism and \u2018fertility\u2019.\nToo right! And this is where we most urgently need to counter the notion that without a considerable rate of growth, we\u2019ll fall into stagnancy or recession. The truth is that if we keep expanding, we\u2019ll eat ourselves out of house and home, so to speak.\nIt befuddles me entirely as to how anyone can talk of balance with respect to society or environment without prominently mentioning this point \u2013 our most glaring point of imbalance.\nAs we head into harder times, with ever-rising fuel prices and the consequent ever-rising prices of everything else, it is going to be of the utmost importance that the balance between market forces and government regulation move towards the latter.\nStrong governance, that helps protect the vulnerable and distribute wealth a little more evenly, is going to be vital.\nThis will necessitate a strong rule of law, which will need effective enforcement. There are many laws now that are not effectively policed, allowing some to get away with brazen offences while others cop it sweet for lesser things. So, a considerable boost in police and other regulatory personnel will be needed.\nAs unpalatable as it may seem to some, I think that a more socialistic and at the surface, a more restrictive regime, is going to be highly advisable as the personal stresses exerted by changing grass-roots economics start to cause aggressive, unscrupulous or desperate people to exploit the battling average citizen.\nIf we want a \"Good Society\" we really have to stop knocking Gods Word and trying to squish it under foot.\nIt wont go under foot by the way.\nThe Holy Bible is the only book that fully teaches loving God... and our neighbour as ourself (Mark 12:28-31).\nAnything other preaching, or thesis, is towards the flesh (men doing it mens ways...i.e. leading to failure) and will end up in sexual immorality and social chaos.\nAll of the nations that have knocked The Word, and the missionaries who brought it, are third world nations with too many problems to mention.\nThere is plenty to think about here. IMO, the essential overall theme when talking about a mixed society is the yin-yang balance. Or every action causes a reaction. If we are to achieve the optimistic outcome that Tristan poses, then money is going to have to be made available for it. As money is a limited resource, that means taking it away from something else. If we are to police the law fully and properly, this is going to cost as well. The government has only so much money to allocate to all the activities it has to maintain.\nOne of the important elements in the solution is that we have to find ways of making things like houses etc cheaper to construct en masse. Another is that we need to be more original and make products that have value and that other countries are prepared to pay for. A further one is that we have to start making sure that our expenditures actually solve problems rather than create them. This is where the real hard work is as it often means attacking the status quo.\nI think the first step towards establishing a \"Good Society\" is to take power out of the hands of the corrupt ruling political class whose only agenda appears to be to steal as much wealth as possible from the rest of us in order to line the pockets of merchant bankers, corporations, land speculators and property developers.\nIf we don't stop this trend of handing all of our collective wealth across to our greedy selfish elite, then we stand no chance in an overpopoulaite world with diminishing resources, particularly energy of achieving a decent society.\nUnless the likes of NSW Premier Iemma and NSW Treasurer Costa are stopped, we stand not chance whatsoever of establishing a decent society.\nThe writer cautiously supports the market economy, albeit with some concessions to appropriate intervention.\nNot surprisingly, because in these days it is nearly impossible to argue against the sacred cow that has become 'The Market'. It is like arguing against a deeply rooted theology. The Market IS the Holy Bible of today. Both sides of politics revere the market.\nWhether we like it or not, progressive privatisation of government assets and services has rendered 'the market' the dominant thing that governs the society we live in. It has become like a chronic life-long disease we just have to live with, so our language accommodates the disease.\nFirst of all we saw basic government services converted into business enterprises. Then we saw those enterprises sold (privatised). Then we saw public funds used to prop up privatised enterprises that couldn't make it on the market.\nThen we found that environmental and social considerations are not dealt kindly by the free market.\nToo late! By then we had seen all the arguments that 'the market' could not work effectively or efficiently if hampered by government intervention. And we even saw a range of laws that forbade market intervention (purportedly in the interests of fair competition).\nAnd after all of that..... now we are reduced to talking up the market economy, or at least locking it in our language as the mainstay of economic, social, environmental and spiritual health - with a few nips and tucks of course.", "PLANNING A BIG EVENT, such as a multi-day conference, can be a daunting task. Below are five tips that will help you navigate smoothly through the planning process.\nWhat is your desired outcome?\nIs the topic attractive to a broad audience?\nIs the theme in line with your organization\u2019s mission?\nWhat is your budget for the event?\nWhat is your attendance goal?\n26 weeks from event: Secure event venue and keynote speaker.\n20 weeks from event: Compile invitation mailing list.\n12 weeks from event: Begin designing event invitation.\n11 weeks from event: Create online registration page.\n9 weeks from event: Finalize invitation layout and design.\n7 weeks from event: Print invitations.\n6 weeks from event: Mail invitations.\nBe sure to budget plenty of time to accomplish each task, as there are often unforeseen hiccups that can delay your progress.\n3. Everything Is Negotiable. In these tough economic times, many organizations are feeling the squeeze, especially when it comes to event budgets. Keep in mind that nearly any event-related cost can be negotiated\u2014all you have to do is ask! Rental fees, sleeping room rates, audio-visual costs, and menu prices can all be negotiated. For example, hotels love to charge rental fees to use their meeting space as a means of earning extra revenue. However, there is often a lot of flexibility to negotiate these fees. If you are serving a lot of food at your event (a nice dinner with wine service, for example) or using a lot of hotel sleeping rooms, a hotel will often waive the rental fee because they know they will make up the additional revenue.\nYou can also play one hotel off another. For example, if the Hilton is offering you $170 a night for sleeping rooms, you can challenge the Marriott to beat their price. When every penny counts, you can save a lot of money by negotiating for everything.\n4. Make a List, Check It Twice. A major challenge in planning an event is keeping track of all the details. Between coordinating the load-in of multiple vendors to tracking the flights of your keynote speaker, there is a lot to keep an eye on. There are two easy tricks to help keep things straight.\nFirst, create a master checklist covering every conceivable event-related task and the date by which each task should be completed. This will serve as a handy reminder of items to complete and will make it easy to chart your progress. The week before the event, circle back with each speaker, vendor, and hotel contact to re-confirm your arrangements.\nSecond, create a binder with tabbed sections covering each element of the event. This tool will keep all your vital information in one central place. Your binder should have tabs for lodging, transportation, flowers, audio-visual, menus, invitations, and conference speakers.\n5. Build the Buzz. To ensure your event has maximum impact, effective marketing is important. Begin by selecting a topic and speaker with broad appeal, and give the event an interesting title that will entice participants to attend. Once you\u2019ve pulled together a top-notch program, you need to get the word out to your target audience. Give your guests ample advance notice of the event so they can mark their calendars. Send out a \u201cSave the Date\u201d notice six months in advance to help build buzz. The invitations for the event should hit the mail no less than four to six weeks from the event, and follow up with e-mail reminders to encourage guests to RSVP as you get closer to the event.\nBe sure to make it easy for guests to RSVP. Online registration is a great tool, but you should also give guests the option to register by mail, fax, or phone (just in case you have some guests who are not tech-savvy). Promote the event on your organization\u2019s Web site, and include a link to the registration Web page.\nYou can also boost your attendance numbers by partnering with like-minded organizations\u2014for example, members of a local Rotary club or state policy organization might be very interested in attending an event in their area. This creates a great opportunity to bring your message to a fresh new audience.\nFor a nuts-and-bolts guide to planning an event, the comprehensive reference is Event Planning: The Ultimate Guide to Successful Meetings, Corporate Events, Fundraising Galas, Conferences, Conventions, Incentives and Other Special Events by Judy Allen (John Wiley & Sons). Also, The Complete Idiot\u2019s Guide to Meeting and Event Planning by Robin E. Craven and Lynn Johnson Golabowski (Penguin Group) provides a good overview.\nIf any dignitaries will be in attendance at your events, be sure to pick up a copy of Protocol: The Complete Handbook of Diplomatic, Official and Social Usage by Mary Jane McCaffree and Pauline Innis (Devon Publishing). This book covers the protocol of seating and receiving lines as well as the proper use of titles for royalty, elected officials, and members of the military.\nMs. Kayrish is Assistant Director of Special Events at The Heritage Foundation.", "The San Antonio Spurs entered the 2018-19 NBA season without a starting caliber point guard on their roster. The Spurs lost Tony Parker in the recent free agency, while Dejounte Murray, whom they considered as their point guard of the future, suffered a torn ACL in a preseason game. Despite being undermanned, the Spurs still managed to remain competitive in the deep Western Conference and are currently sitting in the No. 6 spot with a 27-21 record.\nHowever, in order to have a real chance of beating Western Conference powerhouse teams like the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets in a best-of-seven series, the Spurs should upgrade their roster before the February NBA trade deadline. According to Kristian Winfield of SB Nation, the Spurs may consider trading for Mike Conley of the Memphis Grizzlies to address their backcourt problem.\nAfter realizing that they don\u2019t have the capability to contend for the NBA championship title, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN revealed that the Grizzlies have started listening to trade offers to Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. Winfield believes Conley would be a perfect fit in San Antonio. He could ease the load on DeMar DeRozan\u2019s shoulders on the offensive end of the floor and play \u201ccat-and-mouse\u201d with LaMarcus Aldridge.\nAcquiring Mike Conley will not only solve the Spurs\u2019 major backcourt issue, but he will also give them a very reliable scoring option. This season, the 31-year-old point guard is averaging 19.8 points, 6.1 assists, and 1.3 steals on 42.2 percent shooting from the field and 35.4 percent shooting from beyond the arc.\nIn a proposed trade deal by SB Nation, the Spurs will be sending Loonie Walker IV, Rudy Gay, Patty Mills, Dante Cunningham, and a future first-round pick to the Grizzlies for Mike Conley and Omri Casspi. The deal works on ESPN\u2018s NBA Trade Machine. The Spurs\u2019 suggested offer is exactly what the Grizzlies are looking for in any deal involving their superstars \u2013 a young player, draft pick, and salary cap relief.\nHowever, as of now, it remains unknown if there is an ongoing negotiation between the Spurs and the Grizzlies centered on Mike Conley. Expect more rumors to circulate before the February NBA trade deadline.", "President Donald Trump has endorsed GOP Rep.

Multiple generations of Cowboys fans can now sadly proclaim they have no idea what it\u2019s like to watch their team compete for a Super Bowl, and their allegiance is born from of geography, or family ties, more than success.\nSo which is the harder life: Being a fan of the Cowboys, or the Redskins?\nNote that this interview was conducted before the Redskins lost a good portion of their offensive line to injury, and starting quarterback Alex Smith to a season-ending injury on Sunday.\nThe last time the Redskins won the Super Bowl was 1991; that was the last time they reached an NFC title game.\nThe Cowboys will host the Redskins on Thanksgiving Day with first place in the NFC East available for one of these two bumbling franchises to grab.

Whenever the evil Gorg determines their location and heads their way, the Boovs run for their lives \u2014 this time to the planet Earth, where they relocate nearly all the humans in the world to a brightly colored amusement park in Australia. The Boovs think they\u2019re doing the humans a favor, but let\u2019s face it: We\u2019re talking about an alien invasion in which the native populace is relocated to a prison camp. Fun setup for a kids\u2019 movie!\nTip\u2019s pretty awesome as girl-power role model. She\u2019s smart, funny, sweet and fiercely determined to outmaneuver the Boovs and find her way to her mother. She despises the Boovs, but after a meet-cute with Oh in a convenience store, she\u2019s stuck with this particular Boov. Tip needs to find her mom, and Oh is on the run from the Boovs, who blame him for inadvertently revealing their latest location to the dreaded evil Gorg. So off they go on a sweet but very predictable adventure in which they start out as enemies, until they both realize \u2026 well. Come on. That\u2019s hardly a spoiler alert. You know how it\u2019s going to turn out.\nAnother fun feature: the Boovs change colors according to their moods. Their \u201chome\u201d color is purple, but they\u2019ll go green or red depending on the situation, while other features shape-shift. You can visualize the thousands upon thousands of people-hours that must have gone into the process.\nThe problem is, the story lacks originality and zest. Tip and Oh banter and bicker and bond and banter and bicker and bond. The Boovs hunt for Oh. Tip yearns for her mother. Cue another Rihanna song.\nAnyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music.\nCall me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.\nDreamworks Animation presents a film directed by Tim Johnson and written by Tom J.

Opens Friday at local theaters.", "BP has begun its long awaited \"top kill\" operation to try to stem the flow of oil from beneath the Gulf of Mexico.\nThere are no guarantees it will be successful - even President Obama says so.\nBP's chief executive says so far the operation is progressing as planned but \"top kill\" can't come too soon for the people of Louisiana, who are concerned about their livelihoods and their wildlife.\nThe online pictures BP is providing are amazing. They are never-before seen shots of an underwater operation never-before tried at this depth.\nThe sci-fi equipment is pumping heavy mud straight into the gushing oil riser.\nTop kill works like this: Vessels on the surface of the sea carry pipes that have been lowered deep into the ocean. The pipes shoot a heavy mixture into the broken riser, hopefully killing off the high pressure jet of oil spurting out of the seabed. Cement will be used to seal it off.\nIf the mud from the \"top kill\" doesn't do the trick, BP will have to think again.\nAmong its options is a so-called \"junk shot\" to help plug the hole - the junk could include old tyres, golf balls, tennis balls and even bits of rope - again topped off by tonnes of cement.\nAs BP began top kill, Louisiana's governor, Bobby Jindal, led a delegation back into the wetland marshes to see if the oil was as bad as it was the last time he went out at the weekend.\nThe governor said it was.\n\"Heavy thick oil is still there \u2026 an area that should have been teaming with life was literally still - you could see the discolouration of the canes. This, again, is one of the most important nurseries for the Gulf.\"\nAnd wildlife is what the battle to stop the oil leak is all about.\nLouisiana's famous Pelican Island is home to hundreds of Pelicans \u2013 the state bird. Recently declared safe from extinction, it's now once again in danger.\nWe filmed a Pelican that can be classed as one of the lucky ones. Sticky with oil, the bird's now been cleaned up at an animal rescue centre in Fort Jackson.\n\"At this point daily we're seeing four to six birds \u2026 we've actually been here for a month already and we have very few birds compared to what we normally see.\"\nThe hope is BP will get lucky shutting down oil from the Deepwater Horizon well to keep this disaster from growing and continuing to put the Gulf Coast in peril.", "Today's industrial yeast strains are used to make beer, wine, bread, biofuels, and more, but their evolutionary history is not well studied. In a Cell paper publishing September 8, researchers describe a family tree of these microbes with an emphasis on beer yeast. The resulting genetic relationships reveal clues as to when yeast was first domesticated, who the earliest beer brewers were, and how humans have shaped this organism's development.\n\"The flavor of the beer we drink largely depends on yeast,\" explains Kevin Verstrepen, a yeast geneticist at the University of Leuven and VIB in Belgium. \"We're drinking the best beers now because ancient brewers were smart enough to start breeding yeast before they knew what they were doing. It was really an art.\"\nWith a team of bioinformaticians led by Steven Maere, a computational biologist at VIB and Ghent University, and beer scientists from White Labs in California, Verstrepen and his colleagues sequenced the genomes of 157 different strains of yeast used to make beer, wine, spirits, sake, bread, and bioethanol, as well as some used in research labs, to explore the species' evolutionary history. The researchers also experimentally tested traits such as stress tolerance to investigate the interaction between the genome and the yeast's behavior.\nAccording to the analysis, the industrial yeast used today came from only a few ancestral strains. Five large groups separated out genetically, with strains mainly clustered together according to their industrial purpose. Geographic boundaries further divided each category: in one grouping of beer yeast, for example, the strains from Belgium and Germany were closely related, but separate from those in the UK and US.\nBrewers use the same yeast to make different types of beer, so beverages such as ales or stouts didn't generally have separate strains associated with them. However, a few distinct strains were associated with beers that have very specific traits, such as the smoky clove-like flavor of German Hefeweizen beer.\nUsing the genomic data, the researchers traced the common ancestor of the industrial beer and wild yeasts to the 1500s--before the formal discovery of microbes. \"If early brewers had a very good fermentation, they were smart enough to harvest the yeast sediment and use it to inoculate the next batch, even if they didn't know what was floating around in it,\" explains Verstrepen. \"Reusing the microbes to make beer completely separated them from nature. The yeasts were evolving in the brewery.\"\nThe research team uncovered a number of genetic patterns related to the domestication process. Wild yeast can sexually reproduce during times of starvation or stress, but today's beer yeasts have lost this ability--they only have functional genes for asexual reproduction, likely due to their cushier living conditions. \"They essentially became sterile,\" says Verstrepen.\n\"Four centuries of domestication have also left marks in beer yeast genomes associated with traits that are useful in a brewing environment,\" says Maere. \"In various beer yeast lineages, specific genes have been amplified, deleted, or altered to optimize growth in beer fermenters and beer taste.\"\nIn particular, the researchers found evidence for amplification of genes involved in metabolizing typical beer sugars and selection against production of 4VG, an undesirable flavor compound produced by most natural yeasts. \"As far as we know, there's no selective advantage in suppressing the production of 4VG\" says Verstrepen. \"It must have been the brewers saying, 'This tastes good, we're going to reuse it.'\" Wine yeasts also displayed a genetic resistance to copper, which is used to fight fungal infections in the vineyard and can end up in the grape juices.\nVerstrepen's team is continuing research to breed new yeast strains with characteristics useful to industry, and will soon be adding a brewery to the lab to conduct further experiments. \"It's a short jump from working with yeast to trying to make better beer yeast,\" he says.", "\"The Perfect Weapon\" is the startling inside story of how the rise of cyberweapons transformed geopolitics like nothing since the invention of the atomic bomb.\nDavid Sanger is national security correspondent for the New York Times and bestselling author of \"The Inheritance\" and \"Confront and Conceal.\" He has been a member of three teams that won the Pulitzer Prize, including in 2017 for international reporting.

But to see the DNC hacks as Trump-centric is to miss the bigger, more important story: Within that same year, the Russians not only had broken into networks at the White House, the State Department, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but had placed implants in American electrical and nuclear plants that could give them the power to switch off vast swaths of the country. This was the culmination of a decade of escalating digital sabotage among the world\u2019s powers, in which Americans became the collateral damage as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia battled in cyberspace to undercut one another in daily just-short-of-war conflict.\nThe Perfect Weapon is the startling inside story of how the rise of cyberweapons transformed geopolitics like nothing since the invention of the atomic bomb.

Two presidents\u2014Bush and Obama\u2014drew first blood with Operation Olympic Games, which used malicious code to blow up Iran\u2019s nuclear centrifuges, and yet America proved remarkably unprepared when its own weapons were stolen from its arsenal and, during President Trump\u2019s first year, turned back on the US and its allies. The government was often paralyzed, unable to threaten the use of cyberweapons because America was so vulnerable to crippling attacks on its own networks of banks, utilities, and government agencies.\nMoving from the White House Situation Room to the dens of Chinese government hackers to the boardrooms of Silicon Valley, New York Times national security correspondent David Sanger\u2014who broke the story of Olympic Games in his previous book\u2014reveals a world coming face-to-face with the perils of technological revolution.

It wasn't a friendly chat.\n\u201cThe reason you don\u2019t want to send a bill over to the House, who could possibly put in place some very good policies for us here, is that you want the American people and the outside groups that you\u2019ve been in contact with to be able to watch us tomorrow,\u201d Corker said to Sens.

But, if you stand and fight it, you will lose. The American workforce has seen the tidal wave of artificial intelligence coming for decades, yet we still have preparation to do. Those who do not, their professions will not survive. Those who embrace the evolution will strive and own the future.\nAn A.I. apocalypse won\u2019t happen in 2019. But A.I. will become increasingly powerful, and make its way from the production floor to the front office and replace jobs.\nExisting companies may cease to exist without A.I., and existing countries will no longer have a competitive role without A.I. skills and capabilities. With the World Economic Forum predicting that A.I. and automation will create 54 million new net jobs by 2022, companies must become a part of the change. When digging deeper in that 54 million new net number, you see that 75 million current jobs are being displaced. What does this mean for business in the next few years? If you do not proactively shift your workforce focus and repurpose your employees, your business will be displaced as well.\nThere isn\u2019t reason to fear if you are a forethinking and proactive company.\nThere is still time to embrace the coming change. Embracing this change means increased productivity, growth and competitiveness for companies and industries as a whole. There are several aspects of most businesses that will dramatically improve.\nFirst on the list is customer service. Customer service will increasingly occur in real time. There will be a greater rate of discovery of the root of more complicated problems. The answers will come faster, the process will be far more efficient and customers will be pleased in a much quicker and satisfying manner. Thus, your percentage of repeat customers will increase, saving you from spending on customer acquisition and increasing your incoming revenue from current customers. Relevant algorithms will be at the heart of this and will only become smarter as time passes.\nAnother field that will be greatly impacted is health care and predictive medicine. One of the main reasons behind this is the growing demand for health care in the United States and the entire world. The McKinsey Global Institute predicts that 890 million new jobs will be created by 2030, a large percentage in the health care field. With A.I. and automation giving physicians better predictive technology, a higher percentage of their work can be shifted to direct patient care and interaction with humans instead of machines. Those changes in turn would create better revenue, better growth, and more importantly, tremendous social impact by increasing the health of the entire population.\nThe human mind cannot and will not ever be able to be replaced. A.I. will not be able to replace human judgment. This is where humanity needs to put its focus. Most importantly, industry leaders need to focus on retraining and lifetime education, as well as setting up new skills education institutes within their companies and industries.\nThe future is a train that waits for no one, and A.I. is the engine of the 21st century. The WEF and the PwC concur that A.I. will produce up to $15 trillion towards the GDP of the U.S. alone by 2030. A.I. is nowhere near the peak of its powers. The coming decades will produce more powerful A.I. deployments. We will progress from simple chatbots to more complex and capable cognitive human-like agents. Chatbots can be helpful but are usually quite limited in their capabilities. These A.I. assistants will have autonomous interactions with external customers or internal users, and eventually take more and more actions by themselves.\nThere will be an increasing amount of A.I. deployments and adoption. In 2019, more companies will adopt some form of conversational A.I. Those companies that have already dipped a toe in the water will expand A.I. into multiple departments. In 2019, we will see the augmented workforce continue to expand its footprint. From customer service and support to marketing, sales, customer success, and even to critical internal departments like human resources and finance. We are still in the infancy of A.I. and discovering its capabilities.\nA.I. will move to grow revenue. As of 2018, only 47 percent of digitally mature organizations say they have a defined A.I. strategy. As more and more companies are founded and mature, they will learn to leverage A.I. In 2019, more companies will use A.I. to grow revenue by implementing A.I. in marketing and sales teams. Netflix used this exact same method back in 2017. They saved $1 billion by adding A.I. to create personalized recommendations for their subscribers. More and more companies will begin to install these types of predictive analytics to please their customers. A.I. has historically been implemented to reduce costs; now, more and more, it will be used to grow revenue.\nIn the short and medium term, adoption of A.I. will create more jobs. In the longer term, 20 to 40 years, we expect some job functions to be replaced by A.I., while new functions are created. This is the natural evolution of jobs. We no longer have telephone switchboard operators or people who pump gas at gas stations, yet our unemployment is near record lows. Some amount of job displacement is inevitable due to pressures of automation and self-service, but those people in those roles can be repurposed by forward thinking leaders. Those who do not look to A.I. and the future and see the opportunities, but instead focus on the obstacles, will be left in the dustbin of history.\nMark Minevich is the principle founder of Going Global Ventures\u2014read his full bio here.", "Newswise \u2014 A national drug shortage crisis is potentially affecting the care received every day for thousands of patients undergoing anesthesia. In an informal ASA member survey, more than 98 percent of respondents noted that they now regularly experience drug shortages at their institutions and more than 95 percent of respondents said the shortages impact the way they treat their patients.\nShortages of injectable opioids and local anesthetics are affecting many anesthesiology practices, public, private and academic throughout the country. Multiple causes have been cited including: pharmaceutical company consolidation, a vulnerable supply chain including production limits from the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, key supplies of these drugs being limited to a single manufacturer, lack of back-up production and reliance on a production facility in Puerto Rico that was damaged during Hurricane Maria.\nHistorically, drug shortages occur cyclically throughout the years, but the current crisis appears to be more significant, making it a top priority of the Society. So much so, ASA President James D. Grant M.D., M.B.A., FASA, addressed the issue by asking ASA members to complete a short, informal survey to garner information about specific drugs in short supply, or that are unavailable, as well as how the shortages are affecting patient care. Dr. Grant noted that the member information was critical to increase the understanding of the issue by regulatory organizations and policymakers.\nAlmost 2,500 members (close to 5 percent of ASA members) completed the informal, non-scientific survey. Ninety-eight percent of respondents said they are experiencing drug shortages on a consistent basis. More than 95 percent of respondents noted the shortages are affecting how they care for their patients. The top five drugs listed in short supply were pain relief medications like hydromorphone (dilaudid), fentanyl, and morphine, the local anesthetic drug bupivacaine, and the life-saving drug epinephrine.\nAlthough this survey was an internal member instrument and not scientifically validated, the findings and anecdotal reports are cause for concern. ASA is aggressively and continually working with key policymakers and stakeholders, including federal agencies and Congress to ensure they are aware of the impact on patient care and offering to partner with them to work toward both short and long-term solutions to this serious problem.\nTHE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS Founded in 1905, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is an educational, research and scientific society with more than 52,000 members organized to raise and maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology. ASA is committed to ensuring physician anesthesiologists evaluate and supervise the medical care of patients before, during and after surgery to provide the highest quality and safest care every patient deserves.", "Later today we will see Tim Cook and his team of merry men take to the stage once again, and this time they will show us what they have in store for us over the next few months, and while we do not know what products they will be releasing for certain, two items on the agenda are iOS 7 and Mac OS X 10.9.\nWe\u2019ll get to iOS 7 later today, but we thought we would take a look at what Mac OS X 10.9 features we can expect to see, and what kind of cat the latest version of Apple\u2019s Mac OS will be. The huge banner at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, doesn\u2019t seem to be giving anything away, so we can\u2019t tell if the upcoming version will be a simple design, and what cat they will be going for this year.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t stop us from discussing a Mac OS X 10.9 wish list, in terms of new features, and improvements over the current version. Firstly, we expect Apple to integrate iCloud far greater than they currently do, such as sharing folders, documents and other such things to help accessible. Although Apple\u2019s Cloud service is still a long way behind rivals Google.\nSiri is certain to make it into this next Mac OS X update, giving you control over certain aspects of your operating system by voice alone. To some of you this will be seen as a gimmick, just as it is on the iPhone and iPad, but to others it will be a very useful tool, especially those with disabilities.\niOS is expected to pay a much greater role in OS X 10.9, what we mean by this is how many perceive iOS to be simplistic, and so taking this approach with Mac OS X could be a very clever move indeed, albeit a bold and brave one by Apple at the same time.\nThe Contacts app of the current version of the operating system is not very usable. Okay, you can use it, but it\u2019s not easy to use and seems to be in a bit of a mess, so would be nice to see an updated version with improved features with an emphasis on simplicity.\nThese are just a few ideas, but what features would you like to see brought into Mac OS X 10.9, and what name should Apple go with?", "Maggie Steffens was a FINA women's water polo Player of the Year before she scored her first goal for Stanford.

I'm pretty skeptical about the idea, mostly because the consumer market for messaging apps and services is already overcrowded, and it's hard to envision Amazon bringing anything new or differentiated to the table in terms of voice/video calling, group messaging, photo/video filters, or any of the other relatively standard features that are essentially table stakes for messaging services in 2017.\nThat being said, there is one feature that has some potential: chatting with businesses.\nConnecting consumers with businesses is a core aspect of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger monetization strategy, one that it has been articulating for a couple of years now. The idea, which was likely spawned from the growing trend of leveraging social media as a customer service platform, is to help businesses automate and scale customer service interactions in part by utilizing chatbots, with the businesses footing the bill. Currently, Facebook is trying to \"build the behavior\" of consumers reaching out to businesses on a messaging platform, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, which is still a fairly new concept for most people.\nApple Business Chat (left) vs. Facebook Messenger for Business (right). Image sources: Apple and Facebook.\nMeanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has outlined its own ambitions to connect consumers with businesses in iMessage with Business Chat, as part of its broader efforts to turn iMessage into a content platform. Business Chat is a new feature that developers can use in iOS 11, and will publicly launch next year. Apple will even facilitate e-commerce transactions with Apple Pay integrations. What's less clear is how Apple plans on monetizing Business Chat, if at all. It certainly doesn't need to monetize Business Chat directly, which could be one of many features that simply help sell more iPhones. Facebook has attempted to integrate various payment and e-commerce features into Messenger. It's made little progress on this front, but the social media specialist not about to give up anytime soon.\nSeeing as how Amazon is the largest e-commerce platform in the world, the company could be uniquely positioned to facilitate precisely these types of interactions. It has all of the data and details regarding the countless transactions it processes, and since Amazon also helps handle customer support (one of the benefits it offers merchants), it could also benefit from greater automation and scale.\nLike Apple and Facebook, Amazon hopes to turn messaging into an outlet for its e-commerce platform. Amazon's description of Anytime notes that users will be able to get customer service, make reservations, check order status, and shop. The company also points out that bank account information will be securely encrypted and private. This is where the true potential for Anytime lies -- in bolstering Amazon's core e-commerce business.", "RALEIGH \u2014 The Rocky Mount Telegram and its sister publication The Tarboro Weekly racked up a total of 10 awards Thursday night during the N.C.

He said the group's aim was to engage with voters' emotions and promote \"ordinary voices\".\nMr Offord told the BBC: \"It is going to allow people to tell their stories.

Analysts say it's a sign that al-Shabab is still very much a force to be reckoned with.\nTuesday's attack came three years to the day after al-Shabab militants attacked a Kenyan military base in neighboring Somalia, killing over 100 troops. In 2015 extremists stormed Garissa University College in Kenya's North Eastern Province, killing 148 people. The last attack linked to al-Shabab in central Nairobi occurred back in 2013 at Westgate shopping mall, resulting in 71 deaths, including the four gunmen.\nEach of these events resulted in changes to the way the government carried out counterterrorism activities and led to increased monitoring of the porous Kenya-Somalia border.\nThe Kenyan government has been recognized for its relatively successful counterterrorism strategy, especially when it came to curtailing al-Shabab fighters attempting to cross into Kenya from Somalia. So Tuesday's terror attack was largely unexpected.\n\"People thought that the security agencies were on top of things, so it really is a surprise to many people,\" Emmanual Kisiangani, a Nairobi-based political analyst, told DW.\nKenya significantly increased security spending in 2015 and also implemented a decentralization process which allocated more power to the region and local levels with the aim of better tracking extremists within the country. Kisiangani thinks Kenya's security agencies have done relatively well in preventing major attacks up until this point.\n\"It's a very difficult thing to prevent these attacks totally,\" he says. \"They say that the security agencies always need to be right, but terrorists only need to be right once. In between, the security agencies have certainly preempted many similar attacks, including one about a year ago which could have been quite dramatic.\"\nThe fact that al-Shabab has been referred to as \"weakening\" by governments, security agencies and the media in recent months may have also spurred on the group to carry out as dramatic an attack as possible.\n\"We have had a few instances where we think al-Shabab is extremely weak and on the brink of being annihilated,\" says Kisiangani. \"Then they want to prove that they are still strong. Every time people think that they are [weak], they try and do something to send out a message that they still have the capacity to cause harm.\"\n\"Al-Shabab did something that was unexpected in many ways,\" he told DW. \"But when it comes to their modus operandi, it's rather typical [for them]... We've seen it before at Westgate and we've seen it in Mogadishu as well.\"\nBut recruitment by al-Shabab of Kenyans -- the majority of whom are young, disillusioned and from the country's poorest neighborhoods --remains one of the biggest challenges for security forces. Kenya's military is leading a large-scale operation in the Boni National Reserve near the border with Somalia, hoping to push al-Shabab militants back across the border, and preventing them from reaching out to sympathizers inside Kenya.\n\"I think the Kenyan police have been relatively successful in getting to some of the recruit lines and command networks inside Kenya,\" says Hansen. \"But they haven't been successful in addressing the root causes. There is still a lot of radical youth.\"\n\"Given the limitations of Kenyan security, you cannot police each and every place,\" Kisiangani told DW. \"So it is feasible they could have actually crossed the border.\"\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta was quick to reassure concerned citizens on Wednesday morning that the situation was under control and they were free to \"go back to work without fear.\" Only a few hours before, sporadic gunfire could still be heard as people were rescued in the early hours during an operation described by police as a \"mopping up\" exercise.\n\"The government does not want to instill any more fear because of course this is the objective of these terrorists,\" Kisiangani said. \"So it is natural that the government wants to be positive.\"\nBut while the immediate damage appears to be over, Hansen believes Kenya should quickly turn its attention to mitigating the longterm damage. Far from being a random attack, the target was chosen very deliberately in order to inflict as much harm as possible on the country's vulnerable tourism sector -- physical or otherwise.\n\"Al-Shabab is really hitting Kenya where it hurts,\" Hansen told DW. \"The effects of this attack haven't been fully felt yet. We will now see the reactions of the various [international] travel agencies and see how much this will lead to financial losses.\"", "Lamar Pierce is a nonresident senior fellow in Governance Studies and is the faculty director of Brookings Executive Education at The Brookings Institution.

Lee M. Krug, MD of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and a member of the NCCN Guidelines Panel discussed recommended treatment options for patients with MPM as well as first-line therapy regimens.\nMesothelioma is a rare form of cancer in which malignant cells are found in the mesothelium, a protective sac that covers most of the body's internal organs. Pleural mesothelioma refers to the thoracic-based form of the disease, the most common type of mesothelioma.\nAlthough asbestos exposure is a major risk factor for mesothelioma, it can remain latent for more than 20 years and may require a predisposition to the disease. In addition, it can also occur in individuals that previously experienced radiation exposure (e.g. treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma).\nDr. Krug noted that, \"Diagnosing mesothelioma is often difficult, because the symptoms are similar to those of a number of other conditions. In addition, a physician's initial evaluation of a patient may reveal pleural effusion, but it can often be missed on pleural fluid cytology.\"\nCommon symptoms of mesothelioma are shortness or breath or chest pain among others including tumor fevers, sweats, weight loss, and pneumonia.\nA surgical biopsy is often required to effectively diagnose a patient with mesothelioma according to Dr. Krug. PET scans can aid in staging as well, detecting unexpected metastases in 10 percent of cases.\nPrognostic factors include gender, lymph node status, and histology, but Dr. Krug also pointed to other potential markers that may be indicative of the disease.\n\"Serum markers may also have prognostic significance as studies show that patients with mesothelioma have higher levels of Soluble Mesothelin-Relation Protein (SMRP) and Osteopontin,\" said Dr. Krug.\nLike any cancer, treatment for mesothelioma depends on many factors including the stage of the cancer, where the cancer is, and how far the cancer has spread. Dr. Krug described treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation that may benefit patients as described in the NCCN Guidelines for MPM.\nSurgical procedures for MPM can range from a pleurectomy/decortication for those patients with early stage disease to more aggressive procedures, such as extrapleural pneumonectomy. Extrapleural pneumonectomy includes the removal of pleura, the lung, diaphragm, and pericardium, but can result in major complications and should only be performed by experienced surgeons.\n\"The role of aggressive surgery remains controversial,\" said Dr. Krug. \"As outlined in the Principles for Surgical Resection for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma in the NCCN Guidelines, physicians need to be highly selective when choosing potential candidates for this procedure.\"\nSurgery alone can be inadequate due to residual disease and a high rate of relapse, so the NCCN Guidelines recommend a combined modality therapy approach for select patients noted Dr. Krug.\nThe NCCN Guidelines consist of a section detailing the Principles of Radiation Therapy for MPM that stress the need for a multimodality approach including evaluation of the patient by radiation oncologists, surgeons, medical oncologists, diagnostic imaging specialists, and pulmonologists.\n\"Radiation is recommended as an adjuvant therapy to improve local control after surgery, and it is also an effective palliative treatment for relief of chest pain that is often associated with mesothelioma,\" said Dr. Krug.\nDr. Krug explained that MPM was historically felt to be chemoresistant, but that recent studies have shown that certain regimens can benefit patients and also can be added for systemic therapy either before or after surgery.\n\"The NCCN Guidelines recommends pemetrexed (Alimta\u00ae, Lilly USA, LLC) with cisplatin (Platinol\u00ae, Bristol-Myers Squibb) or carboplatin (Paraplatin\u00ae, Bristol-Myers Squibb) as the optimal first-line combination chemotherapy regimen for patients, though others can be considered based on comorbid conditions,\" said Dr. Krug. \"On the other hand, there are extremely limited data on the benefit of second line therapy. A few specific regimens are listed as second line options in the NCCN Guidelines.\"\nThe NCCN Guidelines are developed and updated through an evidence-based process with explicit review of the scientific evidence integrated with expert judgment by multidisciplinary panels of physicians from NCCN Member Institutions.

He was on the go Friday, too \u2014 to the Philadelphia Phillies.\nThe NL East-leading Phillies swung a deal four days before the trade deadline, getting Cabrera from the Mets for Double-A right-hander Franklyn Kilome.\n\"He's proven in the batter's box,\" Philadelphia general manager Matt Klentak said. \"He's a solid hitter and can cover three defensive positions. We see him playing second, short and third. Adding a player with flexibility to our roster was really important. We think he's an excellent roster fit for our current group of Phillies.\"\n\"We think this was our most pressing need. It was important to get this one done, but we will continue to make phone calls looking for any possible way to upgrade the club,\" he said.\nCabrera was hitting .277 with 18 home runs and 58 RBIs as the Mets' second baseman. The 32-year-old Cabrera was a two-time All-Star shortstop for Cleveland earlier in his career.\nNew York saves the remaining $2,883,065 of Cabrera's $8.25 million salary, which is assumed by the Phillies. He is eligible for free agency after the season.\nIn the middle of a disappointing season, the Mets traded closer Jeurys Familia to Oakland last weekend and saved $3,025,134 of his $7,925,000 salary.\nCabrera split his time at second base, third base and shortstop last year with the Mets. He has started only at second this season. He homered, doubled twice and drove in four runs in Thursday night's 12-6 win over Pittsburgh.\nCabrera was traded at the deadline four years ago when Cleveland sent him to the Washington Nationals for their playoff push. After that win over the Pirates, he said he knew he could again be on the move.\n\"There's nothing I can control. Whatever they do, they want to do what's best for the team,\" Cabrera said. \"I hope to stay here. I like New York. I like the team, the town.\"\nCabrera was in the original starting lineup for Friday night's game at Pittsburgh. Jeff McNeil took over the spot after the trade.\n\"For the last two years, (Cabrera has) been a real leader for us, a true professional from the day he walked through the door,\" Mets assistant general manager John Ricco said.\n\"I can't say enough good things about him. He's been a leader in the clubhouse and on the field. A guy who never wanted to come out of the lineup and we really appreciated him as a player and a person, and wish him nothing but the best in Philadelphia,\" he said.\nRicco said several teams were interested in Cabrera as the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline approached.\n\"We had teams that were kind of jockeying back and forth, and we spent a lot of time going back and forth with them,\" Ricco said. \"At the end of the day, we thought that Franklyn was by far the best of the candidates that we were talking about.\"\nRicco added the Mets weren't hesitant to trade within the NL East.\n\"You always keep an eye on that,\" he said. \"But in this case, with a player who's a potential free agent at the end of the year, I think it's less of an issue. Frankly, it's probably more of an issue for the Phillies, dealing a young pitcher who they may end up seeing for a lot longer than we'll probably see Asdrubal in a Phillie uniform.\"\nThe 23-year-old Kilome was 4-6 with a 4.24 ERA for Double-A Reading this season. He is 2-1 with a 2.16 ERA and 21 strikeouts in 25 innings during July.\nRicco described Kilome as a four-pitch guy who's \"a little raw,\" but complimented his potential.\n\"He's athletic. He's got a power arm and he's a starting pitcher, which is something in the last number of trades that we've made, we've been targeting more relievers. This gives us a starter that's in Double-A and is fairly close to being ready for the big leagues,\" he said.", "CHIZZY Akudolu is the latest star set to strut their stuff on the Strictly Come Dancing dance floor.\nThe actress who played heart surgeon Mo Effanga in the BBC drama has signed on the line for the dancing show.\nAnd it seems that the star is very much looking forward to donning the glittering costumes that Strictly Come Dancing is famous for.\nIn a statement, Chizzy said: \u201cWhen I was 13, I made the finals of a disco dancing competition once but there was this amazing girl who exploded onto the stage with a gorgeous sequined costume, throwing glitter everywhere\u2026 I knew it was game over for me.\nThe star hung up her stethoscope in June this year, so no doubt Holby fans will be thrilled to see her back on their screens.\nChizzy won\u2019t be the only Holby City star to take part in the show.\nHer fellow actor Joe McFadden is also in the line-up for series 15.\nIn a statement announcing his place, Joe, who plays Raffaello \u2018Raf\u2019 di Lucca in the show, said: \"Strictly is one of the biggest, most entertaining shows on TV and being asked to be part of it is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\n\"I\u2019m thrilled and terrified about in equal measures!\" added the 41 year old.\nChizzy joins Charlotte Hawkins, Brian Conley, Susan Calman, Aston Merrygold, Simon Rimmer, Joe McFadden, Reverend Richard Coles, Gemma Atkinson, Ruth Langsford, Davood Ghadami and Mollie King who have also been confirmed for the new series.\nHer big news comes hot on the tail of Charlotte Hawkins, who was announced as the 11th star to be taking part on Monday morning.\nAdmitting that she wasn't able to tell anyone, the journalist said: \"Nobody knows, I kept it a secret from everyone.\"\nAs Kate and Richard recalled their time on Strictly, Charlotte hoped that her past experience of dancing would help her.\n\"I did dancing as a child and I did a bit of ballet,\" she added.", "Fasthosts left some customers without access to their backups for roughly six days \u2013 after it tore down systems it feared were vulnerable to the WannaCry malware.\nThe Brit web hosting biz confirmed to The Register that it pulled the plug on gear hosting some of its customers' online storage service last Friday.

The US Navy said an unarmed Iranian drone flew near a French and American carrier on January 12, but couldn\u2019t confirm it was the same incident.\nThe reported drone overflight comes after a series of naval incidents between Iran and the US in the greater Persian Gulf, including test rocket fire by the Islamic Republic and its brief capture of American sailors who strayed into its territorial waters.\nThe report by state television said the drone flight occurred on the third day of the naval exercise, suggesting it happened Friday. Later, its website and the semi-official Fars news agency, which is close to Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guard, published footage it said was of the drone\u2019s flight.\nThe footage showed the drone launch and later hover above what appeared to be an aircraft carrier underway in a body of water. The footage zoomed into a row of fighter jets on the carrier\u2019s deck. There were no identifying marks visible on the carrier.\nThe Associated Press could not independently verify the footage. Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, a spokesman for the US Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet based in Bahrain, said an unarmed Iranian drone flew near the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle and \u201cdirectly over\u201d the USS Harry S. Truman on Jan. 12 as the vessels were in international waters in the Persian Gulf.\nHe said the drone \u201cposed no danger to the ship\u201d as the unmanned aircraft was unarmed and the carrier wasn\u2019t conducting flight operations at the time.\nIt \u201callowed our men to go so close to the warship and shoot such a beautiful and accurate footage of the combat units of the foreign forces,\u201d he told state television.\nState television and the state-run IRNA news agency said an Iranian light submarine also participated in the surveillance operation. When asked about the submarine report, Stephens said \u201cIran has several submarines underway for its current exercise,\u201d but declined to discuss specifics.\nThe Iranian report did not name the US vessel filmed by the drone. The nuclear-powered USS Harry S. Truman, based out of Norfolk, Virginia, is in the Persian Gulf region launching airstrikes and supporting operations against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.\nStephens said the drone report would not affect its operations.\n\u201cI can say that we are confident in the ability of US naval forces operating in the region to respond appropriately as the situation dictates, and will exercise our right to defend our forces against any threat,\u201d he said.\nSeparately, state television said Iran\u2019s navy successfully fired surface-to-surface Noor cruise missiles during the drill at mock targets. Iran has announced other military exercises in the past to demonstrate the capabilities of its armed forces.\nIran\u2019s navy began the naval drill this week over a 3-million-square-kilometer (1.16-million-square-mile) area including parts of the Strait of Hormuz, the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean. Iran said Wednesday its navy warned a US warship to leave an area of the naval drill. The U.S. Navy later denied its operations were affected by the Iranian drill.\nWhile Iran recently struck a nuclear deal with world powers including the US, its naval forces have continued its maneuvers. Iran has more than 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) of shoreline facing the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman.\nThe US has criticized some of those maneuvers, including what it called a \u201chighly provocative\u201d Iranian rocket test fire in December near its warships and commercial traffic passing through the Strait of Hormuz. Iran denied launching rockets, though the US later released footage showing the rocket fire.\nThe Strait of Hormuz, which sees nearly a third of all oil traded by sea pass through it, has been the scene of past confrontations between America and Iran, including a one-day naval battle in 1988.\nIn January, Iranian forces captured 10 US Navy sailors who entered Iranian territorial waters near Farsi Island, an outpost in the middle of the Persian Gulf that has been used as a base for Revolutionary Guard speedboats since the 1980s. The sailors were released within a day, though Iranian state media aired footage of the sailors\u2019 capture, angering US politicians.", "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a reused first stage launches the SES-10 communications satellite into orbit from Florida\u2019s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on March 30, 2017.\nThe SpaceX rocket that made history last week by flying its second orbital mission launched on its first jaunt one year ago today.\nOn April 8, 2016, a SpaceX Falcon 9 booster launched the company's uncrewed Dragon capsule on a resupply mission to the International Space Station for NASA. About 8 minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first stage came down for the company's first-ever landing on a \"drone ship\" in the ocean and its second successful touchdown overall during an orbital mission.\nThe March 30 mission marked a big milestone for SpaceX, whose billionaire founder and CEO Elon Musk has prioritized developing fully and rapidly reusable rockets as a way to slash the cost of spaceflight. Before the SES-10 flight, the company had landed eight Falcon 9 first stages during orbital missions, but it had never re-flown one.\nEventually, SpaceX aims to launch and land each Falcon 9 first stage many times. The booster is designed to fly 10 times with no hardware changes and at least 100 times with only moderate refurbishment, Musk said March 30 during a postlaunch teleconference with reporters.\nBut the newly landed booster won't achieve such levels of reuse; its flying days are done, according to Musk.\n\"We think this one has some historic value, so we are thinking the Cape might like to have it as something to remember the moment,\" he said in the March 30 teleconference, referring to Florida's Cape Canaveral, the launch site for SES-10 (and many other missions as well; the Cape hosts NASA's Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station). \"We are going to present it as a gift to the Cape,\" Musk added.\nSpaceX did something similar with the first-ever Falcon 9 first stage that landed successfully.

The information collected was able to be separated by counties and leagues.\nSCPL secretary Terry Burstow told us: \u201cThe Sussex Cricket Board (now part of Sussex Cricket Ltd) followed this up, in conjunction with the Sussex Premier Cricket League (SPCL) and a further player survey of Sussex players was carried out.\n\u201cFrom this the main things that were learnt were that players wanted more competitive games. They felt that too many were one-sided.\nAnother change for the 2017 season sees half the games being played as timed games and the other half as limited overs (50/50 in the Premier Division and 45/45 in the others).\nBurstow said there were four steps the SCPL took to put the league structure and format in place.\nHe said: \u201cThe first step was, therefore, to bring this anomaly into line. The second step was to move the bottom 20 teams in the Sussex League into the feeder leagues, at an appropriate position to their strength, leaving the Premier League with the county\u2019s best 60 teams, in line with the league\u2019s elite status.\n\u201cThe third step was to introduce some win/lose cricket, which was already being played in some divisions of the feeder leagues. The SPCL decided to adopt the same format which takes place in the surrounding first class Counties.\n\u201cThe Premier Leagues in Kent, Hampshire, Essex and Surrey already split the 18-match season\u2019s schedule into nine timed games and nine limited overs win/lose games. The fourth step was to cater for the early finish requirement and this could only be done by shortening the game or starting earlier.\n\u201cThere was little appetite for shortening the games and so earlier starting times were proposed.\nFirst and second XI teams can now face each other in the SCPL, but teams from the same club cannot be in the same division.\nBurstow said: \u201cClubs would be unable to have two teams at the same level, so a promotion would be denied or a 2nd XI could be relegated if their first XI was relegated into their Division.\nWhat do you think of the changes?", "John Press of John Realty, DeLand, Fla.

Here's why big biotechs Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) like these much smaller partners.\nAmgen and Cytokinetics agreed to work together to develop heart-failure drugs way back in 2006. As part of the deal, Amgen also bought a $33 million stake in the smaller biotech. In 2013, Amgen bought another $10 million in Cytokinetics' stock.\nThe lead program being developed by the two companies is omecamtiv mecarbil. The experimental drug targets treatment of heart failure by activating a protein known as cardiac myosin. A phase 2 study of omecamtiv mecarbil showed positive results. As a result, Amgen plans to advance the drug to a late-stage study.\nAmgen's initial investment in Cytokinetics hasn't exactly paid off yet. Shares of the small biotech have fallen more than 70% over the past 10 years. However, Amgen's subsequent investment in 2013 hasn't done too badly. Cytokinetics' stock is up nearly 40% since the second purchase by Amgen.\nIn 2013, Celgene and Bluebird agreed to jointly develop cancer treatments using gene therapy to modify chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T). Under the terms of the deal, Celgene paid Bluebird $75 million up front. A couple of years later, the two companies modified their agreement to focus exclusively on anti-B-cell maturation antigens (BCMA).\nEarlier this year, Celgene exercised its option to license a promising candidate in Bluebird's pipeline -- bb2121. Phase 1 results of bb2121 in treating multiple myeloma were encouraging. The experimental drug appeared to show efficacy in achieving full or partial remission without the toxicity seen in other CAR T therapies. It's still very early in the development process, but Celgene and Bluebird have reason to be optimistic.\nUnlike some of its deals with smaller biotechs, Celgene didn't buy a stake in Bluebird. That's probably a good thing, though. Bluebird's stock has dropped over 60% since the companies first forged their partnership. However, things appear to be looking up now for Bluebird. It has two late-stage candidates, LentiGlobin and Lenti-D, as well as its CAR-T program.\nGilead Sciences and Galapagos inked a deal in late 2015 to jointly develop JAK1-selective inhibitor filgotinib for inflammatory-disease indications. Galapagos received $300 million up front. Gilead also bought a $425 million stake in the smaller biotech.\nResults from phase 2 studies evaluating filgotinib in treating rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease looked good. Gilead and Galapagos have advanced the experimental drug into late-stage studies targeting both indications as well as ulcerative colitis.\nRumors abounded a few months ago that Gilead might acquire Galapagos. However, the terms of the two companies' agreement prevents Gilead from increasing its stake in the smaller biotech for a period of time.\nSo far, Gilead's initial investment hasn't generated a positive return. Galapagos' stock is down a little since the beginning of 2016. However, the small biotech has still outperformed Gilead: The big biotech's stock has plunged over 25% year to date.\nWhich stocks are the better investment choices -- the big biotechs or their smaller partners? If Wall Street analysts are right, you'd be better off going small.\nThe real answer to the question, though, depends on the level of risk you're willing to take. Amgen, Celgene, and Gilead have solid revenue streams and generate lots of cash. It's a different story for Cytokinetics, Bluebird, and Galapagos. The returns could potentially be higher with the smaller biotechs, but the risks are much greater.", "2 Can I Transfer a Deed to My House to My Kids Before I Die?\n4 How Do Parents Sign Their House Over to Their Adult Child?\nA quitclaim deed can be a relatively easy and quick way to add someone else to your property's title. Many parents use quitclaim deeds, in fact, to add their adult children to their homes' titles, giving the children a legal ownership interest in the homes. There are gift tax implications, though, to giving someone at least partial ownership in your home, especially your adult children. The Internal Revenue Service scrutinizes transactions involving parents, their homes, and quitclaim deeds of those homes to their children.\nA quitclaim deed can be used to give your home to others by literally \"quitting\" your ownership claim in the home. Useful at transferring property ownership, quitclaim deeds also make no guarantee of defect-free property title. As a homeowning parent, you can place your adult children on your home's title or even completely transfer ownership of your home to them using a quitclaim deed. The federal government, though, imposes a gift tax on all gifts exceeding a certain value, including quitclaim-deeded homes.\nBe careful when adding your adult children or anyone else to your home's property title using a quitclaim deed. For one, adding your children to your property's title constitutes a taxable gift in the IRS's eyes. At minimum, you'll have to file a gift tax return when you quitclaim deed an interest in your home to your children. Fortunately, there's an annual $14,000 gift tax exemption plus a lifetime gift and estate tax exemption of $5.25 million that applies to quitclaim-related transactions.\nWhen they're due on quitclaim deed transactions involving home ownership interest transfers, gift taxes are based on homes' fair market values. For example, a home with a $150,000 fair market value that's gifted to its owner's children may be gift-taxed at that $150,000. Also, the IRS requires that the giver of a gift pay any applicable gift taxes, not the receiver. In other words, you'll owe any gift taxes due when adding your children to your home's title using a quitclaim deed.\nThe IRS requires that a gift tax return be filed if the home being quitclaim deeded to your children exceeds the annual gift tax exemption amount. File all gift tax returns using IRS Form 709. You can also make as many gifts of $14,000 or less as you'd like and no Form 709 need be filed, but you can't give more than $14,000 to any one person in a year without also filing a Form 709 for the applicable tax year.\nGuerra, Tony. \"Gift Tax Implications of Putting Children on a Quitclaim Deed.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/gift-tax-implications-putting-children-quitclaim-deed-63221.html. 04 December 2018.", "The Estonian defense contractor Milrem has signed a memorandum of understanding with IGG Aselsan Integrated Systems (IAIS), a joint venture of the United Arab Emirates' International Golden Group and Turkey's Aselsan, informes LETA/BNS.\n\"Milrem and IGG Aselsan are jointly developing an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platform tailored to the needs of the Emirates' armed forces,\" Milrem CEO Kuldar Vaarsi said in a press release. \"The two companies' primary goal is to launch a trials program in the framework of which the vehicle will be tested for capabilities by the Emirates' soldiers.\"\nThe joint product based on Milrem's UGV THeMIS and Aselsan's remote-controlled weapon system SARP is exhibited on the stand of International Golden Group at the IDEX 2017 defense industry fair taking place in Abu Dhabi this week.\nAccording to the head of IAIS, Khalifa Al Boloushi, Milrem's THeMIS makes an ideal platform for SARP.

After having struggled mightily on the right side of the offensive line in 2015, the Bills instead tried to find defensive playmakers through the first three rounds of the draft.\nNow that the dust of the draft has settled, a new name in free agency has appeared: Matt Slauson. According to Adam Caplan of ESPN, Slauson will make two free agent visits -- one with the San Diego Chargers, and one with the Buffalo Bills.\nSlauson, 30, is a seven-year veteran of the NFL, having started on the interior during stops with the New York Jets and Chicago Bears. Making most of his starts and appearances at guard, Slauson has started 85 games over his seven seasons in the league.\nThe Bills coaching staff is familiar with Slauson as well. He played as a member of Rex Ryan's team in New York for four seasons, and then when he went to Chicago, he worked with current Bills offensive line coach Aaron Kromer.\nEven though Slauson has played as a starting guard basically his entire career, their interest in him is not a direct blow to the starting hopes of second-year player John Miller. Well, at least not immediately.\nAccording to Mike Rodak of ESPN.com, the Bills are looking at Slauson as a potential right tackle, which would serve as an immediate threat to Jordan Mills, Seantrel Henderson, and Cyrus Kouandjio for the starting job. There is little doubt that the right tackle position was the worst starting position on the roster in 2015, and without using a draft choice to address it, the Bills are now looking to free agency.\nThe trouble with Slauson, outside of lacking experience at tackle in the NFL, is something he can't control. He has the required size for the position 6-foot-5 and 320-pounds. He even started quite a few games at right tackle during the 2007 season while he was still enrolled at Nebraska. However, his arm length (331/8-inch) has forced his move inside in the NFL.\nSlauson is a proven commodity in the league at guard, and ProFootballFocus.com graded him as one of the Top 10 guards in the league in 2015. If the Bills were to sign him to be the starting right tackle, even an average player would be a drastic upgrade to what the Bills had last season.\nAt worst, if the Bills sign him and it doesn't work at right tackle and John Miller continues to struggle this year, the Bills have some options.\nPerhaps the most interesting part of this, though? If the Bills successfully sign Slauson, that could easily spell the end of the line for former second-round pick Cyrus Kouandjio, who may fall victim to the numbers game. At this moment, he's likely safe. However, another summer of non-progress -- in addition to a notable free agent signing --could make him expendable at the end of training camp.", "\u201cPeople say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you perform as you?\u2019 But I have no interest in performing as me, because I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m particularly interesting on my own,\u201d mused Tammy Lang, the alt-cabaret singer, scabrous satirist and celebrity impersonator better known as Tammy Faye Starlite. Others may beg to differ. At 50, this blond, cherry-lipped singer has the bounce and vivacity of a high school cheerleader and the political sensibility of a radical left-wing journalist.\nIn her mesmerizing theatrical shows, Ms. Lang has won critical acclaim for stepping into the skins of complicated veteran rock divas, like Nico of the Velvet Underground and the British rocker turned art singer Marianne Faithfull. Her newest show brings back Tammy Faye Starlite, a fictional character that made her a downtown New York club star more than a decade ago. The updated Tammy show, \u201cTammy Faye Starlite Presents Holy War 2016 \u2014 the New Regime,\u201d on Friday night, is the first of six planned over six weeks at the downtown club Pangea.\nHer character is not, as her name might suggest, a drag-queen caricature of Tammy Faye Bakker, the evangelist, Christian singer and talk show personality who died in 2007. She is what Ms. Lang calls \u201ca photonegative of a country singer,\u201d which humorously inverts the clich\u00e9 of the female country star as wholesome all-American gal.\nTo prepare for the show, Ms. Lang said, she listened to a nine-hour Sarah Palin audiobook to capture Ms. Palin\u2019s garbled syntax, as well as audiobooks by Joel Osteen and Amy Grant.\nMs. Lang grew up far from the Nashville she skewers in her show, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. One of two children of a judge, Irving Lang, who died in 1987, she attended Yeshiva High School, earned a B.A. in creative writing from New York University, and has been a member of several bands that covered the songs of Blondie, the Rolling Stones and the New York Dolls. She now lives in Hoboken, N.J., with her second husband, the guitarist Keith Hartel.\nTammy Faye Starlite originated in 1996. Before that, Ms. Lang was studying theater and attending auditions and helped start a comedy troupe called Squeal Like a Pig. Inspired by performance artists like Eric Bogosian, Kathy and Mo, and John Leguizamo, she began developing characters. Her specialty is breaking the boundaries of polite speech and speaking her mind through the voices of her creations.\nHer show is not a goofy, snide hillbilly parody but a serious comic creation intended to be so authentic that it might be mistaken for the real thing. As a student and admirer of country music, Ms. Lang has acquired a near-encyclopedic knowledge of its canon and of who\u2019s who in Nashville. While visiting the city, making friends and performing her songs, she has gotten a mixed reception. The \u201cUterus\u201d song drew appreciative laughs, while the more political anti-right material was hissed.\n\u201cHoly War\u201d mixes familiar country music hits sung straight with originals for which she wrote the lyrics. But it is Ms. Lang\u2019s extemporaneous patter, which changes from night to night, that can provoke gasps.\nMs. Lang half-jokingly said she wanted to perform at Caf\u00e9 Carlyle. \u201cI want to be Buster Poindexter,\u201d she declared, referring to the alter ego of the former New York Doll David Johansen, who has played several engagements there.\nThat thought is not inconceivable.", "The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 02/28/2018 settlement date, and Agilysys Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 5.66 \"days to cover\" versus the median component at 4.17.

And he hasn\u2019t forgotten, pointing out that of all the current and potential GOP candidates, none have both knowledge and experience dealing with foreign policy -- a point he makes with almost a twinge of regret that he\u2019s staying out of this year\u2019s race.\nIt\u2019s going to be a tough fight for Bolton. Voters rarely cite foreign policy as their top issue. Consistently, voters have said the economy and jobs are their biggest concerns. And from there, they tend to get more local, picking education is a key concern. And if poll after poll shows the public concerned about jobs and the economy, then the candidates are likely to focus their message that way.\nBut as the 2016 election approaches, more Republicans are pushing for foreign policy. Bolton points to the 2014 midterm elections. A series of foreign affair and national security issues arose as top concerns for voters. The Islamic State group fighters in Syria and Iraq became a daily discussion on the campaign trail, and the spread of Ebola in northern Africa prompted fears about the ability to respond to biological warfare.\nIn 2014, Bolton\u2019s PAC and super PAC raised more than $7.5 million and contributed to 87 House and Senate races. The PACs also made independent expenditures in three Senate races -- backing Arkansas\u2019 Tom Cotton, North Carolina\u2019s Thom Tillis and New Hampshire\u2019s Scott Brown.\nOne of the biggest hurdles for the ultimate GOP nominee will be talking foreign policy on the debate stage with Clinton. She spent four years as the secretary of state and engaged in diplomatic efforts while first lady. Foreign policy is considered one of her strong points and the Republican nominee, who is likely to have minimal foreign policy credentials, will have to find a way to talk with equal authority.\nBolton said he hopes to see the GOP candidates already begin to expand their foreign policy understanding. He pointed to former President Ronald Reagan -- who Jeb Bush likes to evoke when asked if governors can be qualified to handle foreign policy -- who kept diaries examining his foreign policy positions long before he made it to the White House.", "What does the Knight Capital crash mean for you?\nEric Hunsader knew something was going very wrong as soon as the market opened on Aug. 1, 2012. As the founder of stock market data collection specialist Nanex, Hunsader knows what normal market action looks like. This was anything but.\nThe computer systems at Knight Capital (NYSE: KCG) had apparently taken on a mind of their own, erratically trading massive volumes of 140 different stocks. For nearly 45 minutes, Knight's systems blasted away, leading to $440 million in losses -- or roughly $10 million per minute of out-of-control trading. The losses crippled the company's balance sheet and, just like that, put one of the world's largest trading firms on the edge of extinction.\nJason Zweig at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times' Joe Nocera were quick to characterize the turmoil as one more reason for investors to throw up their hands in disgust and exit the stock market completely. They were joined by numerous others, from Financial Times to Fox Business. If you subscribed to the prevailing view, you'd easily conclude that Knight's failure was a sign of a market completely out of control, and, furthermore, that it was a reason for individual investors to lose their last shred of faith in stock markets.\nThis event was different than the Flash Crash. ... The market worked. Capitalism worked. Knight took their loss. I can guarantee you that every firm that has computer interaction, including ours, did a thorough review of their system. In many ways, the market was a good regulator here. Knight was not the Flash Crash. That's very important to understand.\nNevertheless, watching one of the largest market makers nearly go out of business thanks to a computer glitch knocked many investors -- professional and retail alike -- back on their heels. Are unpredictable computer algorithms an inevitable part of the brave new world of investing? Do retail investors need to take special precautions in order to participate in today's stock markets?\nThough \"the market\" may have done well in meting out punishment in the case of Knight Capital, this event highlights the need for investors to have an understanding of the structure of modern stock markets. In the series that follows, we take a closer look at the intricate plumbing of modern stock markets, while also highlighting some of the dangers that investors face. Throughout these articles, we'll suggest strategies that investors might use to protect their portfolio from risks associated with high-speed trading.\nOf course, in order to really understand what went on, it's best that we begin at the beginning.", "The program is called \"Call Me MISTER.\"\nBut when Edward Waters College's new \"Men Instructing Students Toward Effective Role\" program graduates its first students with elementary education degrees, call them \"teacher.\"\nLaunched Monday with a $50,000 AT&T Foundation grant and almost as much in other donations, the program seeks up to four black men a year to become teachers. Scholarships pay tuition, then they must teach for at least five years in schools identified as low performing upon graduation.\n\"It means another avenue for our students to receive scholarship dollars to receive their education and be debt-free when they graduate,\" said EWC's institutional advancement vice president, Wanda Willis. \"... It does not have to be a school in Jacksonville. But we are hoping they will stay in the community.\"\nTony Hill learned about the Clemson University-initiated program when he was a state senator and realized that only a tiny percentage of local elementary teachers are black men. Wanting to get more into classrooms as role models, he helped EWC apply for the AT&T grant and also got $25,000 from the McGraw Family Foundation, $5,000 from his Omega Psi Phi fraternity and $10,000 in private donations. The University of Phoenix also offered two more scholarships.\n\"If we can put a black male teacher in front of Johnny or Joe in the third grade, his chances of graduating go up and his chances of going to jail go down,\" said Hill, now a legislative liaison for Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown. \"The bottom line, you can't be what you can't see.\"\nClemson's Call Me MISTER was developed in 2000, with the title coming from the 1970 Sidney Poitier film \"They Call Me Mister Tibbs.\" It spread to 16 South Carolina colleges, plus Georgia College, Eastern Kentucky University, Mississippi's Jackson State University, Pennsylvania's Cheyney University, Virginia's Longwood University and Washington, D.C.'s Gallaudet University. Those schools have seen 400 graduates become teachers as well as administrators since 2000, Hill said.\nHill met Call Me MISTER's director Roy Jones at a Washington conference five years ago. That led to a Tallahassee workshop with Jones to get it established at Florida's historically black colleges. AT&T has helped EWC in the past and agreed to do so again, spokesman Don Sadler said.\n\"This came highly recommended and had good results,\" Sadler said.\nThe college's program starts with January's new semester, recruiting among its students and area high schools, Willis said. The college is also seeking donations to extend the program.", "The Dragons are hosing Unity in the Community, which is designed to have a few different benefits.\nDerrick Burroughs hosted a recruit for Lane College\u2019s football team this spring when the young player asked the Dragons\u2019 head coach and athletic director a question he\u2019d never had before on a recruiting visit.\nThat caused Burroughs to begin trying to come up with team-building ideas, and also ideas to get the community involved as well, and the first idea he came up with will come to fruition on Saturday.\nFootball players and representatives from Lane will be painting the wall around Lane Field, which was formerly Rothrock Stadium. They\u2019ll also be removing the barbed wire from the top of the walls around the stadium.\n\u201cThis is a 96-year-old stadium we\u2019re playing in, and I\u2019m not sure why the barbed wire is up there,\u201d Burroughs said. \u201cI just know it was there when I first got here in 2010, but we don\u2019t keep anything here that needs to be protected, so we\u2019re taking it down.\nLane Field was formerly Rothrock Stadium where former Jackson public high schools Jackson High, Merry High and Jackson-Central Merry would play their home games. The stadium's name changed to Lane Field when the City of Jackson gave the stadium to Lane College.\nThere will be grills fired up cooking hot dogs and hamburgers, and drinks will be available for any volunteers who show up to help in the painting process. There will also be a DJ on hand playing music to keep the environment lively during the work.\nBurroughs said various elected officials and candidates have been invited to be a part of the day, and there will be a booth set up to register voters before the Aug. 2 election.", "For an illustration of how cruel the country\u2019s latest wave of nativism has grown, look to Louisiana.\nHere, a little-noticed new state law has effectively made it illegal for thousands of refugees to get married.\nThe response? Make it more difficult for immigrants to get married, of course.\nSo, as of this year, any foreign-born person wanting to get married in Louisiana must produce both an unexpired visa (even though a federal court has ruled that marriage licenses cannot be denied based on immigration status), as well as, somewhat inexplicably, a birth certificate.\nNo birth certificate, no marriage, no excuses.\nThe law has indeed placed marriage off-limits to immigrants in the country illegally, as intended. But it\u2019s hurt plenty of legal immigrants, too. Louisiana is home to thousands of refugees, predominantly Vietnamese and Laotians who received asylum in the 1970s and 1980s after fleeing war and communism in their homelands.\nToday these Louisianans often have green cards and even U.S. citizenship, but no access to their original birth documents, if such documents even exist.\nThe law received little attention when it went into effect in January. Which means people such as Out Xanamane often learn about it only when they get turned away at the courthouse.\nXanamane was born in a village near Savannakhet, Laos, in 1975, the year the country fell to communism. Born at home, he never received a birth certificate.\nHe remembers little of his early childhood, except that there were bombs and land mines everywhere. In the decade before his birth, the U.S. military dropped 2\u2009million tons of explosives on the tiny nation, making the country one of the most heavily bombed per capita in history.\nXanamane\u2019s family arrived in Louisiana in 1986, after spending time in refugee camps in Thailand and the Philippines. He has lived in the United States ever since and is now a U.S. permanent resident in the process of applying for citizenship.\nIt wasn\u2019t until he got sick this summer that his lack of birth certificate was ever an issue.\nIn July, he was diagnosed with liver cancer, the same illness that claimed his brother\u2019s life two years ago. The diagnosis meant a lot of changes for his family, the most pressing of which was he really, really needed the state to recognize his marriage.\nXanamane and his significant other, U.S.-born citizen Marilyn Cheng, were married in a Buddhist temple in 1997. But like many in the local Laotian community, they never sought an official marriage license, and never felt they needed to. They have called each other \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife\u201d for two decades, have four children and assumed they probably had a common-law marriage at the very least.\nThey didn\u2019t; Louisiana doesn\u2019t recognize common-law marriage.\nThe couple discovered this when Cheng\u2019s employer, under whose health-insurance plan Xanamane was covered for the past two years, abruptly asked for a copy of their marriage license after bills for his cancer treatments came in. Suddenly all the marriage-related legal protections they\u2019d taken for granted \u2014 health coverage, hospital visitation rights, Social Security survivor benefits \u2014 vanished.\nWithin days they went to the courthouse, armed with Xanamane\u2019s green card, refugee documents and driver\u2019s license. Twice they were turned away.\nThey contacted friends, family, lawyers, public officials, judges, other parishes in the state. No one could help.\nOut of options, and with Xanamane\u2019s access to medical care hanging in the balance, the couple opted for a last-minute destination wedding in a more enlightened state: Alabama. They packed their kids and Xanamane\u2019s sister into the car and drove seven hours to Montgomery, a jurisdiction that happily took appointments for courthouse marriage ceremonies and accepted green cards as proof of identity.\nOn Aug. 8, 2016 \u2014 the 19th anniversary of their Buddhist marriage ceremony \u2014 Xanamane and Cheng were legally declared husband and wife. Then they turned around and drove seven hours home.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the champions of the Louisiana law intended to make marriage less accessible to people like Xanamane, or if they\u2019re merely indifferent to an unintended consequence of their anti-immigrant reflexes. The organization that legislators told me lobbied for the bill, the Louisiana Family Forum, did not return my calls; the state representative who introduced the law, Valarie Hodges, declined an interview request.\nAll we know is that both claim to be a voice for \u201ctraditional families\u201d \u2014 a category that, in 2016, apparently no longer includes immigrants.\nThe Post\u2019s View: America has accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees.

We owe it to the younger generations \u2013 the ones whose minds are unsullied by rose-tinted false memories of Empire. The ones who truly understand that avoiding the next war is more important than celebrating victory in the last one. The ones who have grown up understanding that being born on the other side of a line on a map doesn\u2019t make you different or inferior.\nLiberal Democrats have always understood this \u2013 it goes to the very core of who we are. The time will come, after Brexit is averted, that we can celebrate and congratulate ourselves on being the first party to recognise the coming disaster and stand against it. But right now we need to reach out to everyone around us \u2013 friends, family, workmates, and let them know that the Government has failed them and a better future is possible.\nRead more by Nick Baird or more about brexit, people's vote march or revoke article 50.\nThe ERG seems to be shifting towards backing Mays Deal & the rush to sign the Revoke Article 50 Petition seems to have sunk to a trickle. At the high point last week people were signing at the rate of 2,000 a Minute, right now its at about 150 a Minute.\nI am torn between Hope & Gloom.\nSorry to come in again but I forgot to say how disillusioned I am with the \u201cLeadership\u201d of the Peoples Vote movement. They can organise a good Demo but in Parliament, where it matters, they keep chickening out. A Peoples Vote will not be among the options voted on tomorrow apparently. It seems that The Time is still not right & they want to wait till The Last Minute. We now have 17 Days before we crash out with No Deal, how Last-Minute do we want to get ?\n@Paul Barker \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen it confirmed either way if a People\u2019s Vote will be one of the options. My understanding is that John Bercow will select the choice of options tomorrow.\nPeople\u2019s Vote haven\u2019t even settled on a definite question that they feel should be asked. It seems more like a movement to channel anger about Brexit (and in some cases Corbyn) rather than a remedy for the mess we are in.\nAny wording of a fresh vote will need to be agreed to by the government. It is possible, for instance, we may end up having another referendum without Remain as a direct option.\nAdded to which if it is non-binding there is no more garuntee that the result will be enforced by Parliament than the 2016 one. if we did have a fresh referendum in which the public voted for No Deal, would Lib Dems or TIGs or Blairite Labour MPs honestly go and vote it through. I really can\u2019t see it.\nAdded to which the leadership in the EU oppose another vote. They\u2019re\u200b impatient for us to approve the proposed deal and stop bothering them.\nIt\u2019s all such a mess.\nEconomically and rationally \u2018Leaving\u2019 is a mess.\n\u2018Leavers demanded a parliament free of an \u201cunelected EU dictatorship\u201d; what a sad joke. The UK now has a \u2018dictatorship\u2019 run by Theresa May (who became PM by default).\nParliamentary rules say she can\u2019t do it; but what the heck, like the leader of a banana republic, she says she can.\nThe world looks at the UK Brexit mess and laughs.\nMy money is still on the PM getting what she wants.\nSomebody should start \u201cno-deal now\u201d- and \u201cMay\u2019s WA\u201d- petitions to have a proper race. I would not worry about which would win.\n@Paul Barker \u2013 you\u2019re right to reflect that the current position seems to be finely balanced. Mrs May is probably clinging to the hope that tomorrow\u2019s indicative votes process will prove to be inconclusive and that no clear alternative to her \u201cdeal\u201d will emerge \u2013 in which case she can then come back with MV3 which she would argue as a choice between her deal vs chaos and uncertainty. Alternatively, if a cross-party consensus begins to emerge amongst MPs in favour of, say, Common Market 2.0 or another softer version of Brexit, she will no doubt seek to use that \u201cthreat\u201d to scare the ERG into backing her deal. In either case, the result of MV3 (if it actually happens) is likely to be closer than the previous two attempts \u2013 but, bearing in mind, the DUP\u2019s continued opposition, etc, the parliamentary arithmetic is probably still against her.\nIf the present impasse continues as we approach 12 April, I suspect that that there will be growing pressure for revocation of Article 50 \u2013 which, on a free (unwhipped) vote, a majority of MPs could well support if that was, by then, the only way left to stop a no-deal outcome.\nCurrently less than 600,000 signatures, or a tenth of the Revoke Article 50 petition.\nThere is no petition for May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement because absolutely no one is in favour of it.\nVery few people actually want \u2018no-deal\u2019. Most Leavers would like a deal but not May\u2019s deal.\nThat\u2019s why I haven\u2019t signed any petitions.\nBut, if someone set up a petition for a better deal maybe I would!\nGlad to hear it Peter.\nPeter Martin, of course, always for the unicorn, never something real.\nThank you, Nick. 10:1; I am not surprised.

We all noticed it.\"\nIn the movie, the president&apos;s handlers invent a war to distract public attention from his sexual transgressions. In real life, was the Clinton administration doing something similar?\nCynical in the extreme, that was a question that some residents of the New York region could not avoid asking themselves Thursday. And it seemed to reflect not only the bizarre parallels between fiction and fact, but also the profound distrust that some Americans have begun to harbor toward a president who acknowledged misleading the public.\nThese Americans may well represent a minority. A random sampling of opinions around the New York region yielded at least as many people who said that the president&apos;s authorization of military force in Afghanistan and the Sudan seemed wholly justified and that the United States could never be too aggressive in its efforts to stamp out and deter terrorists.\nEven some of those people who professed antipathy toward President Clinton did not think he would stoop so far as to use military maneuvers to divert people&apos;s attention from Monica S. Lewinsky, the woman the president admitted to having had a relationship that was \"not appropriate.\" \"I don&apos;t think he&apos;s that much of a dimwit,\" said Lina Fetter, an accountant from Morris Plains, N.J.\nBut there were others for whom the timing of the bombings, coming so fast on the heels of the president&apos;s televised address to the country on Monday night, felt a little too tidy, a little too cinematic.\n\"The first thing that popped into my mind was how convenient this was,\" said Brian Cooper, an investment banking analyst who works in midtown Manhattan. \"My brother called me to tell me what had happened, and I said, &apos;Doesn&apos;t this remind you of &apos;Wag the Dog&apos;?\"\nKenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel investigating the Lewinsky matter, fielded a question about \"Wag the Dog\" from reporters on the steps of a court house in Little Rock, Ark.\n\"Yes, I have seen it,\" Starr said with a chuckle. \"Other than that, I&apos;m not going to comment.\"\nAnd Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, mentioned the movie in his defense of the president&apos;s actions Thursday. \"I don&apos;t think the President would be foolish enough to do a &apos;Wag the Dog&apos;,\" he said, according to the Associated Press.\nLess charitable reactions could be found on the Internet, which quickly sprouted jokes that cast President Clinton&apos;s actions as a cunning ploy. In one, a pollster tells the president, \"Your speech bombed. I&apos;m being as candid as I can.\" The president then informs an aide, \"It sounds like he said I should bomb Afghanistan.\"\nBehind much of this lay the uneasy sense that in losing many people&apos;s respect, the president and his administration had become fair game for parody even on a day of grave international developments.\nRoger DeWitt, an actor who was doing clerical tasks in his agent&apos;s midtown Manhattan office Thursday, said that right after he and the other workers in the office heard on television that the president would be making a major announcement regarding national security, they mentioned \"Wag the Dog.\"\n\"Then we all looked to see what tie he was wearing,\" DeWitt said, riffing on news reports this week that Clinton had possibly sent Ms. Lewinsky a message, through his choice of neckwear, on the first day she testified to the grand jury.\nOthers spoke in more somber voices. Amanda Urban, a prominent Manhattan literary agent, said that she immediately drew a connection Thursday between \"Wag the Dog\" and the news reports that she was hearing, but that she shuddered at the serious thought she gave to the parallels.\n\"It&apos;s downright scary that we have to consider the possibility,\" Ms. Urban said. \"These are incredibly cynical times.\"", "Feb. 20, 2018 2:00 p.m.\nSo...I'm related to them, and I haven't heard anything about this being suspicious.

They are still investigating the cause of a fire started in the bedroom of a couple that happen to have a 24-year age difference. There is nothing wrong with that in itself; however, the story the Sheriff is telling, is based on the word of the only person that lived. I am not saying this woman should being accused of anything. But, the stat's are that when one spouse dies in a suspicious circumstance, the other is always the first suspect. Fire Investigators are very good at what they do. They quickly know the difference between a natural fire (By accident); or suspicious. I would think that by this time they pretty much have a cause of the fire? They have to know if any type of chemicals or something else caught fire. But, they did not release that information? The article fails to mention basic information that could be important. They state the ages of the couple, but not how long they have been married? If they have been married for six months to a year; or, if they have been married for thirty years! It makes a huge difference in the investigation.

Former Scientologists and personal staffers linked to the famous actor continue continue share their alleged insight into Cruise\u2019s transformation within the controversial church even though Cruise and estranged wife Katie Holmes have reached a divorce agreement. The quick and quiet arrangement appears designed to keep little Suri Cruise from being exposed to anything Scientology related.

They need approval of the Federal Reserve, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration, which all are expected to act on Thursday.\nConsumer groups say practices of credit card companies blindside consumers and US lawmakers have threatened legislation if regulators did not use their consumer protection powers to reform the industry.\nWith Democrats strengthening their control of the next Congress that convenes in January and the financial services sector in turmoil, credit card companies that resisted the changes increasingly have accepted them as inevitable.\nThey have warned that interest rates charged on credit cards will rise for all borrowers and that borrowing limits may reduce because of the changes.\nThe industry maintains that credit cards provide a service to consumers with convenience and sometimes free loans.\n\u201cThe new rules will be a challenge to the business,\" said Peter Garuccio, director of public relations at the American Bankers Association trade group.\nIn 2007, Americans were using an estimated 694.4 billion credit cards with Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover logos, according to the Card Industry Directory.\nBanking regulators have been using focus groups to test the impact of changing credit card rules for the past couple of years and on Thursday are expected to finalize some changes.\nThey are expected to prohibit credit card companies from increasing rates at will, with some exceptions such as those that apply to people who fail to pay a bill within 30 days.\nSo-called universal default, which permits changing card terms if the borrower defaults on another bill such as utilities or a gym membership, also is expected to be banned.\nDouble-cycle billing, in which card companies reach back to earlier billing cycles to help calculate interest charged in the current cycle, also is expected to be eliminated.\nWith the US economy in recession, the market that trades in credit card asset-backed securities faces increasing stress as more consumers fall behind on payments.\nAs delinquencies and charge-offs \u2014 balances written off as uncollectable \u2014 on credit cards rise, investors demand higher yield spreads for credit card-backed securities.\nThe ABA represents the biggest issuers of Visa and MasterCard. Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase enjoyed almost 70% of the credit card market at the end of 2007, according to the Card Industry Directory.", "A back-and-forth between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump on Thursday highlighted the challenges automakers face when doing business in China.\nAfter Trump jotted off a tweet about America's \"massive\" trade deficit with the Asian nation, Musk responded with a question: \"Do you think the US & China should have equal & fair rules for cars?\"\nTesla (TSLA) vehicles shipped to China face a 25% import tax while a car imported from China to the United States is only taxed about 2.5%, Musk said, \"a tenfold difference.\"\nTrump read the tweet aloud during an event on Thursday formalizing his administration's plans for a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports, respectively. Those tariffs are unrelated to Musk's tweets, but Trump hinted during his speech that he may one day raise taxes on imported Chinese cars.\n\"We just want fairness,\" Trump said after reading Musk's tweet. \"We're going to be doing a reciprocal tax program at some point \u2014 so that if China is going to charge us 25% or if India is going to charge us 75%. ... We're going to be at those same numbers.\"\nMusk said in another tweet earlier in the day that he is \"against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It's like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.\"\n\"We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable,\" another tweet said.\nWe raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable.\nChina is the world's largest car market. And most major American vehicle manufacturers have jointly-owned plants in China so they can avoid steep import tariffs.\nBut Tesla does not. The company wants to open up a factory in Shanghai, but Bloomberg reported last month that Tesla still hasn't landed a deal with local authorities to get it done.\nMusk made it clear in a tweet Thursday that he takes issue with China's rule against foreign car makers owning more than half of any manufacturing plant in the country.\nMary Lovely, a trade expert and senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute, said Tesla is likely hesitant to agree to joint ownership because it \"has valuable intellectual property,\" and China has a big interest in boosting its electric vehicle know-how.\nThere are several native Chinese electric car startups that hope to one day compete with Tesla.\nLovely said there's a reason why the United States and China have such drastically different tariff rates for imported cars. It goes back to when China first joined the World Trade Organization, and it hashed out a deal with the US to keep car tariffs high while slashing import taxes on other goods, such as soybeans.\n\"China has always seen itself as a country that needs a strong domestic automobile industry,\" Lovely said.\nAnd in the past, the 2.5% tariff rate for Chinese cars imported to the US hasn't mattered much. Demand for vehicles is so high in China that the country hardly ships any vehicles abroad.\nVolvo (VOLAF)and General Motors (GM) both began selling Chinese-built cars in the United States in recent years. And as the Chinese market saturates, the country is poised to become a major car exporter.\nThat could mean it's time to renegotiate import and export tariffs, Lovely said. But she doesn't believe Trump's plan to delve into retaliatory tariffs marks the right approach.\n\"The fact that Trump brought this up shows that he doesn't know how trade negotiations actually happen,\" she said. \"Just threatening has never worked with the Chinese.\"\nMusk's twitter exchange with Trump came one week after the president announced the tariff plan, sparking fears of a trade war.\nThe new tariffs will initially exclude Canada and Mexico, Trump said Thursday. The duties will take effect in 15 days.\nLast year, there appeared to be no love lost between Trump and Musk. The billionaire CEO quit two White House business advisory councils in protest after Trump decided to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement.\nBut Trump has delivered glowing public comments about Musk in recent days, specifically about a historic rocket launch conducted by Musk's SpaceX last month. The inaugural launch of Falcon Heavy, the most powerful rocket in operation, captured the public by landing two of the rocket's side boosters after liftoff. They conducted a synchronized touchdowns back on ground pads in Florida.\nTrump gushed about the spectacle to reporters on Thursday.\n\"To me, that was more amazing than watching the rocket go up because I've never seen that before. Nobody has seen it before, where they're saving the boosters. They came back without wings or without anything, they landed so beautifully,\" Trump said.", "\u201cIf we delay, we pay\u201d. This should really sound like music to Indian consumers who have for long fought for such compensation from service providers. Air Sahara\u2019s recent announcement that it would pay Rs 1,500 in cash or Rs 3,000 worth of ticket credit to its passengers for any flight delay beyond 55 minutes should certainly come as a pleasant surprise to air passengers, even though the offer is applicable only on direct metro flights.\nThe Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has come to occupy an important place in the development of the nation and protection of consumers interests. The BIS has conclusively demonstrated that it is possible to bring together diverse interests \u2014 officials and non-officials, the public and private sector, producers and consumers \u2014 and make them work together in nation-building tasks through development of national standards.\nThe draft rehabilitation scheme submitted by Electronic Systems Punjab Ltd (ESPL) has been accepted by the secured creditors and approved and sanctioned by the BIFR.\nEmerging as the largest telecom circle, the number of telephone connections in Kangra and Chamba districts has crossed 1 lakh as the facility has been extended up to the remote areas bordering Jammu and Kashmir.\nONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of ONGC, has opened its office in Russia's oil and gas rich Sakhalin island in the Pacific ocean.\nUS pop star Britney Spears as she will appear in a forthcoming Pepsi commercial to be broadcast prior to this summer\u2019s World Cup soccer tournament.\nTIRUCHIRAPALLI: The proposed merger of ICICI Bank and the ICICI would be materialised this month, following which the number of ICICI Bank customers would be doubled and corporate accounts will go up to 7,000 from the existing 4,000, ICICI Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer H. N. Sinor has said.\n\u201cIf we delay, we pay\u201d. This should really sound like music to Indian consumers who have for long fought for such compensation from service providers. Air Sahara\u2019s recent announcement that it would pay Rs 1,500 in cash or Rs 3,000 worth of ticket credit to its passengers for any flight delay beyond 55 minutes should certainly come as a pleasant surprise to air passengers, even though the offer is applicable only on direct metro flights. (And hopefully, there is nothing in small print there that takes away what is promised !) Initially other airlines may dismiss it as a gimmick, but given the stiff competition on this sector, one can well expect them to follow suit, may be with even better offers!..\nBut what is important here is the underlining promise of punctuality and the recognition of the fact that the consumer ought to be compensated for any failure on the part of the service provider to keep up that promise. The consumer courts have time and again held that delay in providing a service constitutes deficiency in that service and that a consumer who suffers on account of such deficiency is entitled to compensation.\nSo an offer of compensation against delayed flights is a recognition of the consumer\u2019s right to quality service and a commitment to pay a price for any disruption in service, without the consumer having to ask for it. In fact, such payment is more in the nature of a \u201cpenalty against service guarantee\u201d and not a compensation for any specific loss or suffering undergone by the consumer.\nJust as telecommunication service provider or the power supply undertaking imposes a surcharge on the consumer for any delay in payment of bill beyond the \u201cpay by\u201d date, the service provider ought to pay a fine for any delay in the provision of the service. And the voluntary offer is in the nature of such payment: an acceptance on the part of the service provider, of his responsibility towards fulfilling a performance standard, a service obligation.\nIn fact five years ago, when the government asked all Central government departments and public sector undertakings to prepare a Charter of Citizens Rights or consumers\u2019 entitlements vis-\u00e0-vis the services provided by them, this was what consumers and consumer groups expected. Since the charters were meant to bring about efficiency, transparency and accountability , it was hoped that the service providers would not only spell out specific performance standards that would be enforced, but also offer a reasonable penalty in case they failed to meet these standards.\nBesides promising a reasonable speed that would befit the nomenclature of \u201csuper fast\u201d, the Indian Railways, for example, was expected to offer to return at least the super fast surcharge if these trains reached their destinations late. Similarly, one hoped that telecommunication service providers like MTNL and BSNL would promise not just rectification of faults within a specified number of hours, but also offer a penalty of say Rs 50 per day for every day of delay beyond the promised period.\nLikewise, the anticipation from the insurance companies was that they would guarantee settlement of claims within a specified period and pay a decent penal interest if they failed to perform accordingly.\nIn short, the charter was meant to set service standards, improve the quality of service and at the same time, make the service provider accountable to the consumer.\nThe Citizens Charter in the UK, on the basis of which our own charter scheme was modeled, has such in-built penalty clauses. In 1989, for example, British Telecom introduced a scheme giving consumers \u00a3 5 sterling a day for any delay in rectification of telephone fault beyond the promised period. Alternatively, for proven loss, business customers could claim up to \u00a3 5000 sterling and residential customers up to \u00a3 1000 sterling. The London Underground promised to issue a refund voucher if a passenger had to wait on the platform for more than 20 minutes or if the train reached its destination 20 minutes late.\nSimilarly, there were guaranteed standards of performance and a voluntary penalty offer in the power sector. The idea was that as quality of service improved, so would the promises and the quantum of penalty.\nToday we have over 200 such charters drawn up by various government departments and public sector undertakings, including the Indian Railways, insurance companies, hospitals, banks, basic telecommunication service providers, Ministry of Petroleum, central works department and passport office.\nMany states and local municipalities have also published citizens charters in respect of various services provided by them. But barring a few charters drawn up by one or two state governments, no charter has come forward with performance guarantees or penalty clauses. Forget penalty clauses, most of them are not even prepared to commit themselves to specific performance standards.\nMay be in this age of economic liberalisation and competition, the private sector will lead the way and come up with offers of payment of penalty for failing to perform to self-declared standards of service. And hopefully the World Consumer Rights Day (March 15) would give the necessary impetus for such a move.\nThe need of standards of quality is nowhere felt so strongly than by consumers. Standards play an important communication link between the consumer\u2019s needs and the producer\u2019s capability. Standards are important for the exchange of goods. For example, a safety razor blade should fit into the safety razor, no matter where we buy the safety razor or blades; an electric lamp should fit into a holder bought from anywhere, etc. Hence it is imperative that proper standards for products are laid down and adhered to.\nThe BIS has already issued over 17,000 standards in different fields, of which 60 per cent constitute product standards. Nearly 2,000 of these have direct relevance to consumers. Some of the items are condensed milk, biscuits, coffee powder, cement, LPG cylinders, custard powder, incandencent lamps, electric appliances, pesticides and durables etc.\nWhile standardisation and certification are activities that promote consumer welfare, the BIS has made conscious efforts to project its role of consumer protection with the setting up of a nodal department \u2014 the Consumer Affairs Department. This department has been maintaining close relations with consumers and their associations, on the one hand, and the Central Consumer Protection Council and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution on the other, to provide Consumer Welfare.\nThe Bureau is making concerted efforts to train and educate various office-bearers of consumer associations about BIS activities. Awareness programmes are being organised through its regional and branch offices. Efforts are also being made to spread awareness about standardisation and the BIS role among school children so as to bring about an understanding about the role of standardisation during their formative years.\nThe BIS has an all India network. Its Consumer Affairs Department is there to help consumers, in case they come across any BIS certified product which they deem to be substandard. The use of the standard mark or its imitation is an offence under the BIS Act punishable with imprisonment extending up to one year and a fine of upto Rs 50,000/-.\nThe BIS also has the power to search and seize, in case reasonable doubt exists, about any misuse of the standard mark. Consumers are advised to be careful about products carrying the lable \u201cConforming to ISI\u201d or \u201cFitted with ISI element\u201d as these markings are spurious and illegal and mislead the consumer. Consumers are advised to be wary of such misrepresentations and bring them to the Bureau\u2019s notice.\nThe consumers feedback would help the BIS tighten the supervisory control over manufacturers and this, in turn, would help the industry concerned to become a trusted and respected enterprise for the common man, thereby making \u2014 a vital contribution to the improvement of life.\n\u2014 The writer is the Deputy Director-General of the Bureau of Indian Standards.\nAccording to the scheme approved by the BIFR, promoters (PSIDC) are to bring in Rs 5 crore by way of bridge loan to ESPL to pay off the OTS dues of banks.\nThe BIFR, in its order on February 20 had asked the Punjab Government to give various reliefs and concessions to the company.\nThese include declaring ESPL as a nodal agency for Punjab, absorbing surplus employees deputed to different departments, corporations and boards of the state government and declaring the company an approved training centre.\nAccording to Mr Vivek Aggarwal, Managing Director, the company was vying for ISO 9001-2000 certification and decided to restart the production of ceramic disc capacitors.\nThe plans include promoting its DAS and C & I systems, increasing its AMC of computers and promoting its photo identity projects.\nAddressing a press conference here today, General Manager Telecommunications O.P.

The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in the course of its prior consultations.\nAt this meeting, the Security Council will hear a briefing by Mr. Terje Roed-Larsen, Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and Personal Representative of the Secretary-General.\nI now give the floor to Mr. Roed-Larsen.\nMr. Roed-Larsen: Since the last briefing to the Security Council by Mr. T\u00fcrk on 22 August, the humanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian territory has continued to deteriorate. In response to the dramatic decline in living conditions, the Secretary-General dispatched Ms. Catherine Bertini, his Personal Humanitarian Envoy, to review the situation.\nUntil two days ago, there had been six weeks of relative calm in Israel itself, although Israeli military operations resulted in a number of Palestinian civilian deaths during this time. This was strongly deplored by the Secretary-General in his statement of 4 September. This week, we have seen two suicide attacks inside Israel and a bomb blast in a Palestinian school. There have also been meetings of the Quartet. I will begin this briefing with the Quartet\u2019s activities.\nOn Tuesday, 17 September, the Quartet principals held three meetings: Quartet only, Quartet plus five Arab ministers, and Quartet plus representatives of the two parties, represented by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian Minister for Planning and International Cooperation. This was followed by a communique, which members of the Council will have seen.\nThe meetings focused on the humanitarian situation, security issues, institutional reform and political issues. There was a common understanding that these issues are all closely linked and that, for example, neither the security problem nor the humanitarian crisis can be fully solved without a political solution.\nMembers of the Quartet expressed great concern about the humanitarian situation and the finding in Ms. Bertini\u2019s report that the crisis might spiral out of control within months. Fifty per cent of the population are now dependent on food hand-outs from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) or the World Food Programme (WFP), while malnutrition and water-borne diseases are spreading.\nThe latest socio-economic report of the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories (UNSCO), which will be released later today, shows that unemployment is now around 50 per cent; poverty levels have reached 70 per cent in Gaza and 55 per cent in the West Bank while income losses are estimated at $7.6 million a day, meaning a total loss of $3.3 billion since October 2000.\nOn top of this, the Palestinian Authority is facing a fiscal crisis. This month, for instance, the cost of Palestinian Authority operations and supplies stands at $90 million, while the total resources available are less than $55 million.\nMembers of the Quartet underlined to the Israeli delegation the problems of access and movement within the occupied territory and, further, how closures adversely affect Palestinian security training, humanitarian delivery and the ability of the Palestinian Authority and civil society to discuss and implement reform, including the holding of elections, which the Palestinian Authority has called for 20 January 2003. It was also pointed out that the past six weeks had seen noticeable quiet from the Palestinian side \u2014 this was, of course, before the two suicide bombs of yesterday and the day before \u2014 despite many actions undertaken against Palestinians during the same period.\nOn reform, members of the Quartet agreed that progress had been uneven at best, though there were promising signs, especially in the area of financial transparency. Ultimately, the credibility of reform depends on Palestinians seeing improvement in both living conditions and political prospects.\nThe Secretary-General told the parties that, in spite of high-level assurances of increased Israeli cooperation with humanitarian agencies, officials of these agencies are reporting only marginal improvements on the ground. The bottom line is that there can be no real progress on the humanitarian front if Israel does not alter its system of security, which, while based on entirely legitimate and understandable concerns, is hurting an increasingly significant portion of the Palestinian population.\nTo move forward on the humanitarian and development challenges, a United Nations mission involving key agencies working closely with the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, will be dispatched to the region to develop a detailed plan. The plan will be assessed at a United Nations-facilitated meeting involving United Nations agencies, donors and multilateral institutions, prior to a ministerial-level donors meeting in December.\nThe Secretary-General stressed to the Quartet, the regional actors and the parties themselves that it was important to move forward, now more than ever. Increased tension in the region produced by the Iraq issue increase still further the importance of rapid positive movement on the Israeli-Palestinian track.\nAs expressed in the communiqu\u00e9, members of the Quartet were in agreement over a three-phase plan of action or road map for achieving a two-State solution within three years. That plan must be performance-driven, but also hope-driven. The Palestinians need to feel hope to make possible further progress, just as the Israelis need to feel secure.\nSince there is such a lack of confidence between the parties, forward movement will be monitored and assessed by a third-party mechanism to be established by the Quartet. The Quartet principals instructed their envoys to work on operationalizing this mechanism and other aspects of the road map in the coming weeks.\nThe Quartet believes that an important step could be a declaration of statehood with provisional borders, should the Palestinians opt for this, as early as possible in 2003. This would be endorsed by the Quartet, conditional upon its assessment of the reform process.\nThe Quartet also intends to make it clear to the Israelis that they must take immediate steps to allow far greater freedom of movement for Palestinians and goods, withdraw from self-rule areas reoccupied since October 2000, end targeted killings and freeze settlement activity.\nAll this would be followed by permanent status negotiations in the third phase of the plan, from 2004 to mid-2005, and an international conference that would address all tracks of the peace process for a truly comprehensive peace. The Quartet emphasized, both to the regional actors and to the parties, that it could not move forward alone. As the Secretary-General told the parties, action by both on all subjects \u2014 humanitarian, security, reform and the political process \u2014 was essential. The world was counting on them to take mutual and parallel action.\nTurning to the situation on the ground, members of the Council will be aware of a deeply unfortunate upsurge of violence in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza in recent days.\nOn 17 September there was a bomb blast in a Palestinian school near Hebron. Five pupils were wounded, and Israeli police suspect the involvement of Jewish extremists. This is the third incident of this nature this year. On 18 September, two Palestinians were killed and 21 wounded in a series of Israeli Defence Force (IDF) operations across the West Bank and Gaza.\nIn addition, a suicide bomber the previous day blew himself up in Umm el Fahm, killing an Israeli policeman. On 19 September, a Palestinian suicide bomber in Tel Aviv killed five Israelis and wounded 40. These are repugnant and tragic events which the Secretary-General has condemned unreservedly.\nThe past weeks also witnessed a number of IDF operations, including widespread arrests and ongoing assassinations, as well as a tightened closure regime and curfews. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, these curfews confine to their homes, on average, almost half a million Palestinians in more than 20 cities and towns, sometimes for days at a time. Yesterday, troops fired into a crowd of schoolchildren protesting a curfew in the Amari refugee camp in Ramallah, killing a 9 year-old boy.\nIn the month leading up to 17 September 2002, 56 Palestinians were killed by Israelis, and five Israelis were killed by Palestinians. Nevertheless, the period of 4 August to 18 September was the longest without a suicide bomber since November 2000. In this time we also saw sustained introspection on the Palestinian side concerning the utility of violence.\nYesterday, the IDF once again encircled President Arafat\u2019s offices in Ramallah, once more carrying out major demolitions. The siege of his office continues today.\nThe issue of reform continues to be an important one, with progress to date especially in the financial area. Palestinian legislators are awaiting the appointment by President Arafat of a new cabinet, following the resignation last week of the current government under threat of a no-confidence vote. Many are also calling for the appointment of a Prime Minister. The security situation continues to undermine reform efforts. Yesterday\u2019s incursion and the renewed isolation of President Arafat\u2019s compound undoubtedly weaken the position of those working for major reform.\nTurning now to the issue of southern Lebanon, a four-month period of what could be termed tense stability was shattered on 29 August 2002 when Hizbullah launched an attack against IDF positions in the Sheb\u2019a farms area, killing a soldier and wounding two others.\nMore recently, tensions have been raised considerably over a looming water crisis. Lebanon is currently undertaking a water project to draw water from the Wazzani springs. The Government has stated repeatedly that it is fully entitled to draw increased amounts of water from its own sources.\nIsraeli concerns have centred on what it calls the unilateral manner in which Lebanon is undertaking the project and on the perceived potential impact on water flow into Israel. The absence of accurate technical data on the nature and scope of the project has served to heighten tension. The need to obtain independent, technical information has been the focus of all concerned in trying to defuse tensions surrounding this issue.\nTwo United States water experts have been dispatched on a technical, fact-finding mission to the area, in consultation with the Israeli and Lebanese sides. The United Nations has urging both parties to show restraint. The Israeli Government should refrain from the threat of force. The Government of Lebanon has also been urged on several occasions by all concerned, including the United Nations, to provide promptly a detailed report on current water projects in southern Lebanon. Thus far, no documentation has been received.\nTo conclude, and returning to the subject of the Quartet meetings, a number of steps need to be taken by both the Israelis and the Palestinians in several areas.

And, just as importantly to Flake, it would force current members of Congress, many of whom did not vote in 2001, to weigh in on the issue.\nTheir comments followed a Foreign Relations Committee hearing in which two Trump Cabinet secretaries said a new AUMF is not needed.\n\u201cThe uncertainty accompanying that situation could only signal to our enemies and our friends that we are backing away from this fight,\u201d Mattis said.\nTillerson said he has concerns about the five-year time limit in the Flake-Kaine measure.\nThe Flake-Kaine resolution was not the subject of Monday\u2019s hearing, but both senators said it is needed.\nThe AUMF approved in the wake of the 9/11 attacks gives the president power to pursue terrorists who conspired in the attacks, like al Qaeda and its affiliates, without seeking additional congressional approval.\nBoth Kaine and Flake said the war against terror must still be waged, and their measure would not reverse that. But Kaine said that since the 2001 authorization was approved, the global context has changed. He said military involvement in the fight against terror can no longer be viewed as a short-term response to 9/11.\n\u201cThe status quo today is these witnesses believe this war will go on for a very long time,\u201d Kaine said.\nBut the Constitution requires that such a long-term conflict needs greater congressional involvement, he said, and less of a blank check for the president.\n\u201cThe concept of a generations-long war potentially without Congress weighing in is just untenable given the constitutional framework we have,\u201d Kaine said.\nThe senators\u2019 proposal would allow action against Isis, Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other non-state forces that Congress rules to be \u201cassociated forces\u201d to terror groups. But it also requires renewal of any such authorization every five years.\n\u201cThey testified today that they wouldn\u2019t like operational restrictions, and there are no operational restrictions in our authorization,\u201d he said.\nTheir measure has yet to get a hearing, but Flake said he remains confident it will move forward, despite pushback from the administration.", "The Moto X Pure Edition is not just the best giant Android smartphone or the best Android phone for the money. It is the best Android phone ... period.\nIt's everything a great smartphone should be: It's thin, beautiful, fast, has a battery that will get you through the day, it has an awesome 5.7-inch display, a great camera, a super-fast turbo-charging battery, yadda yadda ... yawn.\nEvery high-end smartphone has all of those features. But there are three things that make the Moto X Pure Edition particularly special and worthy of the \"best ever\" recognition.\nSmartphones are deeply personal items -- they're with us all the time. More than any other smartphone maker, Motorola gets how important it is to tailor its smartphones to its customers.\nLike Motorola's two previous Moto X phones, the Pure Edition comes in a huge variety of colors and materials. There are hundreds of different options to choose from, including grippy silicone models in a dozen colors, multiple wood grains and differently styled leather backs.\nMotorola's software is also personal. It's mostly Android as Google (GOOGL) intended it, with just a few welcome tweaks that make your phone your own. For example, the Moto X Pure Edition can change its settings depending on when and where you are. It can go into vibrate automatically when you're at work, read texts aloud when you're driving, announce who's calling when you're home and silence itself when you're asleep.\nIt even comes with an increasingly rare SD card slot, allowing customers to cheaply add storage to their devices and avoid the single biggest ripoff from cell phone companies.\nThe Moto X Pure Edition will only be offered unlocked and without a contract, meaning you won't be able to buy a subsidized Moto X directly from your carrier. But it will work on any of the four nationwide cell phone companies. You can use the same exact phone on Sprint (S), T-Mobile (TMUS), AT&T (T) or Verizon's (VZ) networks.\nThat will give you so much more freedom than you're likely used to. If T-Mobile is offering you a great deal in October, and Verizon gives you a better offer in November, you can switch with no strings attached.\nMotorola also believes that software updates will come in more quickly, since they won't be subject to the traditional carrier approvals that can severely delay even the most crucial updates.\nWhat makes Motorola's new phone really stand out is the price. The Moto X Pure Edition costs about $350 less than the similarly sized Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Think about that: It compares equally or favorably in hardware specifications to its top-selling rivals, but you can get the Moto X for about half the price.\nAt $399, the Moto X Pure Edition is not only the best Android smartphone but the best phone deal as well.\nThe battery is big enough to get you through the day, but it feels like it could have -- and should have -- been even bigger. The Moto X Pure Edition is slightly thicker than the Galaxy Note 5, yet they have the same-sized battery. Notably, the Moto X makes up for it with the fastest-charging battery on the market, giving you an insane 10 hours of battery life with a 15-minute charge.\nAlso there are a few design quirks: There's no fingerprint sensor, which is a drag. The trademark Motorola finger rest \"dimple\" on the back isn't positioned where it should be: It's too low on the phone to comfortably place your finger there. And the front \"selfie flash\" is unattractive on black versions of the phone.\nStill, you're not going to beat the Moto X Pure Edition's best-on-the-market combination of personalization, freedom and price. It's a stunning achievement by Motorola.\nThe Moto X Pure edition is available for pre-orders on Wednesday on Motorola, Amazon (AMZN) and BestBuy's (BBY) website. Motorola says the phone will begin shipping in the next few weeks.", "Sectional sofas offer ample seating, flexibility and comfort.\nSectional sofas are known for comfortable seating and practicality. And you can choose from an array of units -- basic seat units, side chaise, recliners and even corner units with built-in side tables -- to configure a sectional to fit your space. Decorating with sectionals, however, means more than just plunking them down in the middle of the room. You must consider scale, placement and accessories as you tie in the sectional with the room's decor. Creating a floor plan or using space-planning services provided by the dealer helps you get the right sectional units in the right place.\nA small sectional that's sized for a modest living room would look hopelessly lost by itself in a great room or other large space. On the other hand, a bulky and massive sectional that anchors the living area of a loft uncomfortably crowds a smaller room. Remember your room's proportions when selecting your sectional, and remember that visual qualities are part of scale. An overstuffed, rolled-arm sectional in dark brown leather, for example, takes up more visual space than a clean-lined sectional of the same size that's upholstered in a lighter color of linen.\nDetermine your focal point when decorating with sectionals. Typically, an entertainment wall is the focal point as the sectional creates group seating for viewing the movie. Other focal point options include a window wall with a view or an architectural feature such as a fireplace wall. Decide if you want the sectional placed against a wall or floating in the middle of the room. Most important, ensure you have plenty of room to move around the sectional and that the side wings of a U- or L-shaped sectional arrangement do not block traffic flow or doorways. The best way to accommodate these considerations is to construct a floor plan, either by hand on graph paper or using an online tool. You can also take advantage of the furniture store's space-planning services to ensure you get the best placement as well as purchase exactly the right sectional components.\nThe best accessories you can add to your sectional are pillows, pillows and more pillows. Throw pillows add comfort to your sectional's seating and create visual interest by breaking up the sofa's large expanse. Use pillows in a mix of colors that accent your room's palette. Pillows can be easily changed, so they're also a good way to adapt your room's look to the changing seasons, or just to refresh your decor when the mood strikes. Other essential accessories are a rug to define the seating area and coffee or side tables to hold a drink or snack when the family gathers for movie night.\nTie the sectional into its surroundings by creating a vignette. For example, create a picture gallery on the wall behind the sectional to balance the sectional's visual mass. Go bold by including large-scale paintings and even wall sculptures. If the sectional is free-standing, place a sofa table behind it and top the table with tall arrangements of flowers or vertical sculptural pieces. The table will also serve as a useful place to put a book or a coffee mug. If your family members like to read, knit or work puzzles, you will need task lighting. Place floor lamps at the corners of the sectional or use a sofa table to support a lamp. Take care that electrical cords are out of the way to avoid a tripping hazard. For sectionals placed mid-room, installing floors outlets may be your best choice.\nBurch, Jan. \"Decorating With Sectionals.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/decorating-sectionals-96162.html.

Both facilities will be closed.\nThe job eliminations will take effect on June 30, the letter stated, and the respective unions that represent employees have been notified.\nThe Montgomery Developmental Center, which is located at 7650 Timbercrest Drive in Huber Heights, provides services for individuals with severe developmental disabilities. The center first opened in 1981.\nThe closure has an economic impact for the local community in Huber Heights, said Sally Meckling, spokeswoman for the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, which represents staff members at the Huber Heights Center.\nIn 2015, the OCSEA represented 120 staff members at the center.

They are working to find positions at other facilities for the workers.\nIn total, 94 employees \u2014 including exempt staff, OCSEA and other bargaining units \u2014 are still employed by the center. There are 10 residents still living at the facility, and many have already been transferred to other facilities or group homes.\nThe state has been downsizing developmental centers for several years, including one in Springfield in 2005. Meckling said the biggest impact will be on the individuals with severe disabilities and their families.\nEach resident has or will be moved to another facility, some that are in other cities like Columbus or Batavia.\nIn Youngstown, the Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities has worked with county boards and family members to find new homes for current center resident, who also have 10 still living there.\nThe closings are part of the state\u2019s efforts to use more home-based and community-based options for development purposes, the spokeswoman said.", "It\u2019s four in the morning and I\u2019m on call.

When I finally become self-aware I find that a focusing thought for the moment can restore my perspective. Rather than cursing or shouting a meaningless phrase like \u201cSERENITY NOW!\u201d I use a positive phrase containing some solid truth helps me get back on track.\nI\u2019ve also made up my own sayings such as: \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill you still makes you flinch at loud noises,\u201d to remind me that character building has its cost.\nVisual pictures can also help to reassemble one\u2019s sanity on stressful days.

The Carlow man became part of Casement\u2019s plan to recruit an Irish Brigade from Irish soldiers in the British Army (who Keogh fought for in World War I) and who became German prisoners of war.\nWhen Casement was captured and executed by the British for treason, the Irish Brigade project was abandoned. Keogh joined the German army and served on the Western front. In 1919, he was in charge of a barracks in Munich and found two soldiers being pummelled by a crowd of around 200, with one continuing to shout out fascist views even as he was in danger of being bayoneted to death. Keogh ordered the mob to disperse and the two were spared.\nIt was only eleven years later, attending the Nuremberg rallies as an observer when he worked as an engineer on the new subway system, that Michael Keogh realised the man leading the rally was Adolf Hitler, one of the two soldiers he had saved with his intervention in Munich. (Turtle Bunbury wrote an excellent account of Keogh\u2019s exploits on his website here in 2009).\nWhen my grandfather saw first-hand how oppressive the Nazi regmie had become on a daily basis, he changed his views. He knew some of the soldiers and civilans who Hitler murdered on the Night of the Long Knives and he became a marked man.\nHe later returned with his family to Ireland and died in 1964.

Nevertheless, he did concede seeing a go-getter mentality in the Cats on Wednesday.", "What If Joaquin Phoenix Isn't Really Playing The Joker?\nThe upcoming Joker movie from Todd Phillips is an odd kind of comic book movie, and not just because it's a character-driven piece being made off a $55 million budget, a stark contrast to the blockbusters usually populating this genre. Joker is, as one would guess, telling the origin story of Gotham City's Clown Prince of Crime. Unlike in the comics, though, Batman will have no role to play in the cackling criminal's creation, as Bruce Wayne is still a youngster during this period. Which leads me to wonder, what if Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck isn't the real Joker? He is a Joker, to be sure, but what if his purpose is to ultimately inspire the man who will one day become The Joker.\nIn case you haven't been keeping up-to-date on what's happening with Joker, the movie is unconnected to the DC Extended Universe, hence why we're not seeing Jared Leto with green hair, chalk white skin and red lips. Instead, it's a standalone movie set in the early 1980s, following Arthur Fleck, a failed standup comedian who turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham City. For a while, Joker himself was the only confirmed character from the comics (duh), but then Thomas Wayne was cast, and last month, Bruce Wayne and Alfred Pennyworth followed. No doubt we'll learn who's playing Martha Wayne soon enough.\nIt's the Bruce Wayne part of this that's particularly interesting. His parents are still alive, meaning he's somewhere between 8-12 years old. Joaquin Phoenix, on the other hand, turned 44 a few weeks ago, so let's assume that Arthur Fleck is the same age as well. That means Arthur has over 30 years on Bruce, so by the time Bruce ages to adulthood and dons the cape and cowl in two decades, Phoenix's version of The Joker will be in his mid-60s or pushing 70.\nTraditionally in the comics, Batman plays a role in Joker's creation by being the direct/indirect reason this individual, whatever his original name was, falls into that vat of chemicals and is horribly disfigured. Clearly that's not happening here, not just because of Bruce Wayne's age, but because the Arthur Fleck Joker is wearing clown makeup, like Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. But the age difference is still a big deal, as Batman and Joker are usually around the same age. Seeing a Batman at his physical prime throw down in fisticuffs with a geriatric Joker isn't exactly a fair fight.\nThis Joker movie clearly has no problems with not staying faithful to the source material, so maybe in this world, the eponymous antagonist is just several decades older than Batman. But I don't think it's that simple. Unofficial photos and footage from the Joker set show that the clowned-up Arthur Fleck will lead a crime wave across Gotham City, meaning a lot of people will know who he is and what he's all about. Since this is a standalone movie, it wouldn't be surprising if Arthur's reign of terror ends with him dying, but what if his actions indirectly lead to the real Joker being created decades later?\nIt's not like there isn't precedence for a Joker identity misdirect. Like the Joker movie, the TV series Gotham takes a lot of creative liberties with its adaptation of the Batman mythos, particularly where The Joker is concerned. For four seasons, the cackling, psychopathic Jerome Valeska (played by Cameron Monaghan), while never actually referred to as Joker, was clearly meant to be a tribute to the Clown Prince of Crime.\nAfter Jerome died, his twin brother, Jeremiah, was exposed to a special insanity gas, turning his skin white and his lips red, and finally giving him the drive to explore his darker instincts.The Valeska brothers resemble The Joker in their own ways, but Jeremiah definitely looks the part better. Still, even with Gotham's final season over a month away, we still don't know with absolute certainty if Jeremiah is meant to be the true Joker or if a third individual will be brought in to claim that \"honor.\"\nGoing back to the Joker movie, assuming Batman and Joker remain roughly the same age in this continuity, that means there's some kid in Gotham City who will see Arthur Fleck as The Joker either on television or in person. The sight of this criminal will sit with this kid as he grows up, and when the \"one bad day\" comes that he crosses paths with Batman as an adult and is physically altered, that trauma, along with the memory of Arthur Fleck and whatever other disturbing tendencies were lurking beneath the surface, will lead to him becoming the new Joker; one who will leave an even deadlier legacy behind.\nHowever, even if we assume that Joaquin Phoenix's Joker isn't the true Joker, that doesn't necessarily mean he won't have an impact on Bruce Wayne's life. Clearly Arthur Fleck and his followers will cause a lot of mayhem in Gotham City during Joker, and who's to say that won't hit the Wayne family directly? Thomas and Martha Wayne will be alive at the start of Joker, but I suspect they won't be by the end of the movie.\nWhat if during Arthur Fleck's crime wave, that's when the Waynes are murdered in Crime Alley? Joe Chill could be remain the mugger who guns down Thomas and Martha, or, taking a cue from the 1989 Batman movie, maybe Arthur Fleck does the horrible deed himself. Either way, not only will Bruce forever be haunted by his parents' death and be pushed on the path to vigilantism (as per usual), he'll also remember how the Arthur Fleck Joker played a role on that night. So when a new Joker hits the scene years later, Bruce will be even more compelled to neutralize him, but sadly, the fight between Batman and this Joker is destined to go on for a lot longer than anyone in Gotham City would like.\nJoker arrives in theaters on October 4, 2019, so keep checking back with CinemaBlend for continuing coverage.

But the odds of winning the jackpot will get worse \u2014 jumping from 1 in 258.9 million in this week\u2019s drawings to 1 in 302.6 million under the new rules.\nThose are tougher odds than Powerball, which is a 1 in 292.2 million shot.\nFor Mega Millions, tougher odds will translate into much bigger jackpots in the future, since there will be more rollover weeks when no one takes the top prize. And that, along with the higher ticket price, will translate into much bigger jackpots in the future.\nMega Millions has been having a hard time competing with Powerball, which raised its ticket prices and lengthened its odds back in October 2015. Since then, the Powerball jackpot has topped $200 million nine times, compared with the three times that a Mega Millions jackpot got that large.\nAnd it\u2019s the big jackpots that bring lottery buyers into the game.\nMega Millions will also introduce a $3 ticket that gives players two chances at the jackpot, rather than one. The catch: A $3 ticket holder is only eligible to win the jackpot prize, not the secondary prizes that range from $1 up to $1 million or more.\nA regular Mega Millions ticket will now have a 1 in 24 chance of winning some kind of prize.

Web pages can be edited in order to improve their visability in search engines, with the aim of appearing at the top of the list of results for a popular search term. The higher up the list of results for a search term a web page appears, the more people will click on it.\nSearch engines such as Google or Bing serve as a huge index of websites. Users use search engines to find web pages with information on a specified topic or subject, and search engines return a list of results ranked according to both the relevancy and authority of each web page on that topic.\nThe more specifically relevant a web page is to a given search term, the more likely it is to appear on the search results page. The web page must also have good authority to appear high in the list, usually indicated by other websites linking to it in relation to that subject.\nGoogle provides its own guide to demonstrate how websites can work with search engines and ensure that content is appropriately indexed.\nThe SEO process becomes competitive when many websites try to appear at the top of the list of results for the same popular term.\nSearch engine optimisation can be particularly important for reputation management around a specific term, such as a name. If a brand wants to control what information appears when people search for their name, they must make sure their own pages appear above those of others in search engine results. They must push positive mentions above negative ones.\nA huge number of factors can influence the ranking of a web page in a list of search results, including the page's relevancy and authority. Search engines such as Google use a secret algorithm to rank their list of results, and SEO professionals spend time working out what those factors are so they can take best advantage of the system.\nIf the web is full of criticism of a brand, those web pages will appear when people search for that brand. An SEO-based reputation management strategy would involve optimising web pages with positive mentions and trying to have them ranked above the negative web pages in search, hiding them from the view of casual browsers.", "Turkish fighter jets early Friday bombed positions of Islamic State jihadists inside Syria for the first time, in a dramatic escalation of fighting after the killing of a Turkish soldier in cross-border clashes.\nThree Turkish F-16s took off from the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir for an early morning bombing raid against three IS targets, dropping four guided bombs, a statement from the prime minister's office said.\nThe operation came after the first major cross-border clashes between Turkey and IS jihadists on Thursday left one Turkish soldier and one militant dead, thrusting Turkey into an open conflict with the Islamists.\nThe bombing raid was the first by the Turkish air force on IS since the Islamists began their advance across Iraq and Syria in 2013, seizing control of swathes of territory right up to the Turkish border.\nIt also came as Turkey, after months of negotiations, finally gave the green light for the US to use a key air base in its south for its air strikes against IS.\nThe decision to launch the Turkish air force's operation was taken at a meeting of security officials in Ankara late Thursday chaired by Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu.\n\"In this context.... an operation was carried out against targets belonging to Daesh inside the Syrian border,\" the statement said, using an Arabic acronym for the group.\n\"Three of our F-16s hit... three targets belonging to Daesh,\" it said, adding that \"the government of the Turkish Republic is determined to take the necessary measures to protect national security\".\nThe planes dropped their bombs just before 4:00 am local time (0100 GMT) and all returned safely to their base.\nOn Thursday, one Turkish soldier was killed and two sergeants wounded in the Kilis region by fire from IS militants on the Syrian side of the border. A jihadist was also reported dead.\nTurkish tanks then responded by opening fire on IS targets in Syria.\nThe fighting erupted after the killing of 32 people in a suicide bombing Monday in a Turkish town on the Syrian border that the government blamed on IS.\nThis sparked an upsurge in violence in Turkey's Kurdish-dominated southeast, where many accuse the Turkish authorities of collaborating with IS, accusations Ankara denies.\nTurkish police on Friday launched raids to arrest suspected members of the IS group and Kurdish militants, in an apparent bid to stamp down on all sources of violence.\nA total of 251 people were detained, the prime minister's office said in a statement, adding that the raids took place in 13 provinces across Turkey.\nPolice had raided addresses in several Istanbul districts in search of members of IS, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and other militant groups.\nThe Dogan news agency said some 5,000 police were involved in the Istanbul operation.\nAs well as IS and the PKK, the operation targeted suspected members of the PKK's youth wing the The Patriotic Revolutionary Youth Movement (YDG-H) and the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party Front (DHKP-C), Anatolia said.\nA female member of the DHKP-C was killed in Istanbul in clashes with police during the raids, the agency said.\nTwo police had been shot dead in southeast Turkey close to the Syrian border on Wednesday, in an attack claimed by the PKK's military wing which said it wanted to avenge the Suruc bombing.\nOn Thursday, another policeman was killed in the majority Kurdish city of Diyarbakir.\nMeanwhile, the YDG-H claimed it had shot dead an alleged former IS fighter in Istanbul late Tuesday and threatened further assassinations.\nTurkey has been accused of colluding with IS extremists in the hope they might prove useful in its aim of knocking out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Ankara has always vehemently denied the claims.\nNATO member Turkey has also fallen far short of playing a full role in the US-led coalition assisting Kurds fighting IS militants, much to the chagrin of its Western allies.\nThe Hurriyet daily said that the accord was finalised in telephone talks Wednesday between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his US counterpart Barack Obama.\nThe New York Times said the agreement, which would allow manned and unmanned US warplanes to use Incirlik for raids against IS, was described by a senior administration official as a \"game changer\".", "The Somerset County Campus Foundation for Allegany College of Maryland announced the awarding of Fetterolf Scholarships to nine county residents in the 2010-11 academic year.\nNicholle Ashbrook of Hooversville is a general studies major.

Velmanette Montgomery (D\u2013Sunset Park) and Councilman Carlos Menchaca (D\u2013Sunset Park) \u2014 who is heading up a census task force in Council \u2014 came out for the debut session, where attendees brainstormed mobilization plans.\nProposals included hosting workshops to educate immigrant residents on their rights and the importance of the survey, requisitioning computer labs at local libraries and schools where locals can complete the largely online survey, and enlisting faith leaders to use their pulpits to preach the necessity of participating in the census.\nMembers of immigrant communities have traditionally shown more of a reluctance to participate in the census, and the lingering threat of a potential citizenship question \u2014 which a federal judge ruled against this month, prompting the Trump Administration to immediately appeal the decision \u2014 will likely further dissuade those locals from participating as long as it hangs over their heads, according to a Sunset Parker.\nBut the CB7 Census Committee is moving full speed ahead with its organizing efforts even as that legal battle plays out in court, because its members want to be prepared for a final ruling that may not go in many of their neighbors favors, according to its chairwoman.\nThe committee will host monthly meetings as it continues to shape its agenda, and encourages all locals in its district to attend the sessions, Rajkishun said.\nAnd CB7 members aren\u2019t the only ones working to ensure an accurate census count.\nBorough President Adams is forging ahead with his own borough-wide awareness effort through his recently formed Brooklyn Complete Count Committee, which will work with civic gurus across Kings County to encourage participation.\nFor information about upcoming CB7 Census Committee meetings, visit the panel\u2019s website at www1.nyc.gov/site/brooklyncb7.\n\u201cTrump administrations general hostility towards immigrants\u201d.???? LIES. Trump has no problems with LEGAL immigrants.why do liberals love claiming that Republicans are against immigrants? No other country just let\u2019s people waltz in to their country and partake in voting, free handouts, healthcare etc... America is the greatest country that the left wants to turn into a third world dump. Just look at SF. We need to help our own citizens before helping these illegals who only want free handouts. They aren\u2019t escaping violence or starvation. Have you seen the pics of these caravans? They are well-dressed and well fed. Nice cell phones they have! We can not afford to take care of the world until we clean up our own country first. Only deranged, mentally ill leftists would want open borders with people bringing in drugs, diseases and criminality. Sanctuary cities are a big draw for people who have committed crimes and want to escape the threat of imprisonment in their home countries. What fools Democrats are. The globalist elite Dems are using their useful idiots to stay in power by throwing around the term \u2018racism\u2019 any chance they get. They lie and the media and Hollywood are happy to oblige. Enough!\nA voice of reason from Reality sounds like your typical retarded trump supporter. No need to say anything else.\nYeah, no need to say anything else because you have nothing intelligent to add. Typical that you resort to name calling and handicap slurs. You are exactly the uninformed democrat pawn that unfortunately infects the outer boroughs. Good job helping out your globalist masters!\n\"Just look at SF.\" Do you even know what that means? Also, why would people escaping violence be in rags and not have things like cell phones? It's this weird bizzaro world mindset that prevents any rational discourse. Were people displaced all around Europe in WWII due to violence all of a sudden filthy poor beggars? Or were they well-dressed and well-fed, just in need of sanctuary? Oh, and the \"open borders\" garbage. Just stop with that. Repeating this stupid talking point just makes you sound dim.\nNo undocumented New Yorkers will answer the Census. Very few legal residents, green card holders, and longtime citizens who may have undocumented family members, tenants or roommates will. I do not fit in these categories, but I will not answer the Census, either. There was a big undercount in Brooklyn in 2010--mostly because white hipsters wouldn't answer the Census. Now they will be joined by many others. The Trump administration is just trying to get information to deport, harass and demonize New Yorkers. We will not cooperate with evil. As for the racists who regularly post their excrement here, no death is too painful for them.\nMidge, I get your motivation behind not responding to the census... but there are big repercussions for under-counting and that is representation and resource allocation! If New York shows few people, we'll get fewer seats in the House of Representatives and guess who would get them instead? The census says we have fewer people, then we will get a smaller cut of federal resources (at least those that are based on census data). This can be real things like the number and location of Social Security offices in the city and state. We need to encourage people to complete the census, not discourage them.\nTyler and Midge are both stage 4 Trump Derangement Syndrome.

Their leader insisted that when the state holds itself unanswerable to the people, \"the broken pane of glass is the most valuable argument in modern politics\".\nThat leader was Emmeline Pankhurst, and the protesters were the suffragettes. Although they faced a great deal of public disapprobation at the time, history has vindicated the international movement for women's suffrage as intrepid citizens who forfeited their freedom, their public reputations and, in some cases, their lives, to win political enfranchisement for future generations of women and girls -- even if they had to break a few windows to do so.\nThis month, the young people of Britain appeared to reach a similar breaking point. Feeling that they no longer have a voice or a stake in the political process, that their votes are worthless if the parties that they supported instantly break their manifesto pledges, they took to the streets in their thousands and launched a furious attack on Tory HQ, smashing windows and dropping banners from the roof. Property damage, it seems, is still the last resort of citizens whose leaders prioritise the interests of private property above the interests of the people.\nLike the suffragettes, the students and schoolchildren who tore into the bottom storey of 30 Millbank have quickly found themselves subject to a media smear campaign dismissing them as savage and feral, unworthy of consideration by an establishment in need of new reasons to denigrate the distress of the disenfranchised. The logic of this propaganda rather bizarrely equates violence against persons -- which was mercifully avoided at Millbank thanks to the poor aim of the one idiot who decided to drop a fire extinguisher -- with damage to private property, which some might argue is a perfectly legitimate response to a government that has just taken a wrecking ball to the life chances of the young.\nMrs Pankhurst would certainly agree with the Millbank protesters. \"There is something that Governments care for far more than human life, and that is the security of property,\" she said, \"and it is through property that we shall strike the enemy.\" The press, politicians and others who represent the interests of business in this country have condemned the 'tens of thousands of pounds' that, in the Telegraph's estimation, were caused to the lobby at 30 Millbank, and called for the arrest of the perpetrators. Only a few, however, drew any equivalence with the tens of thousands of pounds that have, as a result of the forthcoming changes to higher education, been billed to every single young person who wishes to attend college or university from 2012. The young and the dispossessed, unlike the cheery millionaires of the Coalition, have done their maths with a little honesty. And we don't like the sums.\nThe young people who I saw punching their way into Tory HQ last week didn't come armed with tiny hammers hidden in their handbags like the suffragettes -- they had only their fists and feet and a powerful sense of betrayal. They could not, however, have chosen a better target if they'd tried. The building is owned by the Reuben Brothers, prominent Conservative party donors whose fortune totals some \u00a35 billion. Insurance will easily cover what, to the Reubens, must seem a relatively puny loss. Unfortunately, the young people who have just seen their security, their society and their dreams of a better future torn away from them by politicians who were elected on a promise to do the precise opposite do not have any sort of insurance to fall back on.\nSome kinds of vandalism are easy to condemn. Certainly the antisocial furniture-and-window breakage of today's student protesters had an excellent model in the loutishly methodical property destruction of the Bullingdon club, the exclusive Oxford drinking club to which the current Prime Minister and many of his cronies belonged in their own, entirely state-funded university days. After trashing various private dining rooms and student suites, the Bullingdon boys would write cheques to compensate the owners with the lazy confidence with which they would later authorise the destruction of social security.\nIt's easy to condemn that kind of pugnacity as \"despicable\". On the other hand, there are some sorts of vandalism that are so huge and so unspeakable that they're not even considered crimes anymore. The students who shattered the windows of 30 Millbank are being pursued by the police, but nobody has yet called for a witch-hunt of those responsible for the sacking of the welfare state, of public education and of social democracy in this or any other country. This is because it is illegal to smash up someone's lobby, but perfectly legal to smash up someone's future.\nFrom the moment we had language, most of us learned that life was a list of things that we weren't allowed to break: rules, windows, political settlements. The rich, of course, can break all of these things with impunity. The young Oxford students who walked blithely away from the infamous Bullingdon club flowerpot-through-the-window incident twenty years ago are now the most powerful men in the country, and they have few qualms about shattering welfare and education into tiny pieces and selling them off to their friends.\nSources on the ground have suggested that the Millbank protests are just the beginning. If one values social justice above private property, this can only be a good thing, so perhaps it's time that the country began a concerted effort to hold the centre-right to account for its vandalism of civil society.

Apparently they don\u2019t matter in Brooklyn, and they certainly don\u2019t matter to New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio.\nSaturday night there were four shooting incidents in Brooklyn and thirteen people were wounded. There haven\u2019t been any arrests.\nOne police source noted, \u201cYou have some summer weather, alcohol, and competition for pretty girls, and the guns come out.\u201d We think that\u2019s a very small part of the problem. The real problem in New York City this year isn\u2019t guns, mayor Bill DeBlasio.\nNew York City has the same problem as Baltimore where homicides are at a forty-five year high.

Nargis was opened in 2007 by Boris Bangiev, who was born in Uzbekistan and trained as a chef in the United States.\nOn a warm evening in Sheepshead Bay, under a dark canopy of Brooklyn sky, a crowd gathered on the corner of Coney Island Avenue and Kathleen Street, beside a midnight blue awning three storefronts long, enjoying, at last, a gentle spring that augured the tender lamb and other Central Asian delicacies awaiting inside.\nThe main room of Nargis Cafe is large, warm and colorful, adorned with Suzani carpets and Uzbek artifacts, and with the smell of wood smoke, seared meat and spices emanating from the bustling kitchen. Along with uniformed servers all wearing traditional tubeteika caps, an avuncular floor manager works the room, where platters and bottles and plates obscure the surface of tables surrounded by festive groups, mostly Russian-speaking denizens of outer Brooklyn. The crowded confines are also favored by hipster double dates and fashionable Chinese professionals speaking in Mandarin and English.\nThose inside have endured the wait required to enter Nargis on a Saturday night.\nIn 2007, when the Uzbekistan-born, American-trained chef Boris Bangiev, now 36, opened his cafe, he named it Nargis, the Uzbek word for \u201cflower,\u201d which conjures curiosity and beauty and, fittingly, implies growth.\nThe original space was a narrow walk-in, pinched between a florist and a dry cleaner. A bustling takeout service began to accommodate those who could not tolerate the lines. In 2010, the flower shop closed, and Nargis Cafe expanded into the space, doubling its size. When the dry cleaner on the other side folded in early 2013, Mr. Bangiev shuttered the cafe for six weeks to absorb the new space, though even with the cafe\u2019s current capacity of nearly 100 patrons at a time, patience is still customarily required. There is really nothing else like Nargis Cafe around.\nMr. Bangiev selects all of the ingredients \u2014 locally as possible, imported when appropriate. It is a balancing act between honoring tradition and catering to the modern palate. Decidedly non-Central Asian fish varieties, like salmon, sea bass and branzino, were added to the menu. Wood coal is imported from Argentina to ensure that the shish kebabs are infused with the perfect flavor.\nEverything except a few desserts brought in from a local bakery is made in-house, including beef noodles pulled by hand, and dumpling casings and savory pastry crusts rolled early in the morning, long before the cafe opens. Mr. Bangiev performed the pulling and rolling and almost all the cooking himself in the fledgling years of Nargis. Even though he has entrusted the kitchen to his cooks, Mr. Bangiev can still be found each day and evening at the cafe, immersed in every aspect of his restaurant.\nWhat happens, though, for the most part, is fairly predictable. Groups arrive, liquor in hand. They endure the wait for a convivial meal of multiple courses, blending flavors from Asia, the Middle East and the Mediterranean: fresh breads, appetizer spreads, stuffed dumplings and pastries, rice pilaf (Uzbekistan\u2019s national dish), roasted whole fish and shish kebabs. Hot tea is served in traditional pots.", "Nguyen did not work in the technology industry, but this was her employer\u2019s way of making sure that all staff had at least a basic understanding of good cyber awareness.\nVietnam could use more people like Nguyen, according to security professionals. They say the country\u2019s small businesses, in particular, do not realize how big a threat they face from hackers or other sources of data breaches.\nBut small and medium enterprises (SMEs) should care, cyber professionals say, especially considering the factors that make security risks even more acute in Vietnam. These include the Southeast Asian country\u2019s widespread use of pirated software, the high internet penetration among a tech-loving society without the IT support to match, and the love-hate relationship with China.\nThere are two kinds of people, said Vu Minh Tri, vice president of cloud services at the gaming company VNG, deploying a favorite global cliche -- those who have been hacked, and those who do not know that they have been hacked.\nA new wrinkle in the story comes from neighboring China, with some cyber-attacks believed to be related to its Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to connect many countries from Asia to Europe through infrastructure projects. Research from the security firm Fireeye suggests Chinese hackers may be used either to defend Beijing\u2019s partners in the Belt and Road, such as Cambodia, or to target those that do not play ball, like Malaysia.\nVietnam has taken a cautious approach to the initiative, with some scholars expressing concern about risks like burdensome loans and over-reliance on China. The Southeast Asian country also has reason to worry about potential cyber fallout. In one famous case, Chinese internet protocol addresses were suspected in the 2016 hack of Vietnamese airports, where screens displayed messages challenging Hanoi\u2019s claims in the South China Sea.\n\u201cIn this digital era, Asia Pacific region has become the largest digital market in the world, creating tremendous business opportunities for SMEs,\u201d Jason Kao, director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\u2019s SME crisis management center, told small businesses at a Ho Chi Minh City workshop his office sponsored last week.\nBut not enough of these small and medium-sized enterprises are paying attention to online security, Kao warned.\n\u201cSince more businesses use computers to connect their customers and store data, cyber-attacks and data leaks can cause serious harm,\u201d he said.\nThe cost burden is understandable, though, he added.\nOn the one hand, a small business might be too little to attract the unwanted attention of hackers. On the other hand, they might be too small to bear the expense of insuring or guarding against attacks.\nThat is the reason ripped software remains popular in Vietnam, earning it a spot among countries to watch in the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s report on intellectual property. Thanks to this pirated software, overseas hackers can access Vietnamese computers, which they use in denial of service attacks - sending so many requests to target websites that the sites become overloaded and shut down.\nAt the same time Vietnam lacks the information technology specialists who can alleviate some of these dangers. By one estimate, the country could face a shortage of one million IT staffers by 2020.\nIn the meantime, security advisers offer some basic reminders to increase safety online. Do not click on links, in emails or otherwise, if they are even slightly questionable. Use strong passwords and do not reuse them across different accounts. And of course, avoid pirated software.", "Germination of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) seeds is delayed or inhibited when planted at warm temperatures, leading to delays or failures in germination and seedling emergence and resulting in yield losses and higher costs. The Bradford lab in collaboration with the Michelmore lab previously identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that regulates the temperature sensitivity of germination and subsequently demonstrated that a gene (LsNCED4) encoding an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for abscisic acid (ABA) is responsible for the trait. A second QTL from a different genetic source that also improves germination at high temperatures is currently being fine-mapped and characterized by PhD student Fei-Yian Yoong. Postdoctoral scholar Heqiang Huo and visiting scientist Shouhui Wei discovered that a gene previously known to be involved in regulating seed dormancy (termed DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 or DOG1) is also involved in regulating seed thermoinhibition.

However, the upper temperature limit for germination is sensitive to the environment in which the seeds were produced: seeds matured at warm temperatures can germinate at higher temperatures than seeds matured at lower temperatures. PhD student Mohan Niroula in the Bradford lab is seeking to identify the genetic mechanisms responsible for this environmental plasticity with the goal of making seed performance more consistent and less dependent upon the location of seed production. By producing seeds of a genetic mapping population in a number of different environments, he has been able to identify a QTL associated with this environmental effect on seed germination capacity at high temperature. This work is supported by the Western Regional Seed Physiology Research Group, a consortium of seed and seed technology companies (Ball Horticultural, Bejo Zaden, East-West Seeds, Enza Zaden, Germain\u2019s Technology Group, HM.Clause, INCOTEC, Monsanto Vegetable Seeds, Nunhems USA, Rijk Zwaan, Sakata Seed America, Seed Dynamics and Syngenta).\nWith support from Rijk Zwaan, postdoc Heqiang Huo and visiting scientist Shouhui Wei of the Bradford lab collaborated with the Luca Comai lab in the UC Davis Genome Center to test a new strategy to identify mutations affecting seed germination. Rijk Zwaan scientists induced mutations in lettuce and selected lines that resulted in germination at higher temperatures. Using a method called bulked segregant analysis (BSA), a segregating population of seedlings was separated into groups that either did or did not germinate at high temperature. Total genomic DNA from the selected pools was sequenced, and comparisons of differences in the sequences enabled the identification of the mutated gene that affected germination. This project demonstrated that this BSA by sequencing approach was feasible for identifying specific mutations even in a large genome such as lettuce (2.7 billion base pairs).", "Apple regularly comes top of the polls that score the world's most innovative companies. Here is the main reason why not being the most innovative bodes well for the Apple share price.\nIn the past year, Apple has topped Fast company's -for walking the talk(?) - \"Apple definitely has the keys--because where it goes, everyone follows.\" It topped Fortune's most admired for innovation.\nApple has been innovative and disruptive. It reshaped the smartphone industry while Nokia toyed with its Symbian OS. It gave us the Ultra, with MacAir, and it finally got tablets right with the iPad. That run ended in 2010, too long ago for the kudos to continue accruing to Apple.\nBut leaving the time lag aside, there's a good reason for not considering Apple to be the world's most innovative company. And that's simple. Companies that disrupt need what Brant Cooper and Patrick Vlaskovits, authors of the recently published Lean Entrepreneur, described earlier as a \"sustaining\" period.\nThe market needs to recognize that disruptors go into hibernation and rightly exploit what they have created before they disrupt again, if ever.\nThe lack of cognizance of this is affecting interpretations of Apple's performance. But Apple has been losing innovation kudos - rightly so - for some time, if your reference point is the general public.\nIn the graph below you can see Apple's reputation for innovation in decline from 2010 onwards. At the beginning of 2011 Google was regarded in social media channels as being as innovative as Apple.\nBut Google too had been through a trough just before, after the failures of Wave and Buzz. And that is the most important reason why Apple should not be regarded as the world's most innovative company. Google came back with a 30% share price rise.\nThe reality is innovators need time in the doldrums. They need their relative failures (Maps, Siri). And they need time to reap the rewards of disruption.\nThey can sustain those failures if they switch off the disruption button, or at least tone it down. They become sustaining innovators, improving the basics of their product offerings (Phone 5) and services (iTunes in the Cloud).\nBut just as Google came back with Glass and the driverless car, and updated their innovation reputation (and share price), so too Apple will return. Cook promised as much to investors this week. At that point it will deserve the plaudits once more. In the meantime the most innovative tag is a millstone, forcing its share price down despite its enviable economic success.\nWe and the markets need to embrace the idea of sustaining innovation, periods of incremental change and relative failure. They are what make champions like Google and Apple tick.", "Members of the Taliban say story of leader Mullah Akhtar Mansoor being wounded is \"propaganda\" to weaken group.\nMembers of the Afghan Taliban dismissed claims that their leader was injured in a gunfight during a gathering of several Taliban figures in Pakistan as \"propaganda\" aimed at dividing the group.\nAfghan officials said earlier on Wednesday that Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansoor had been wounded on Tuesday in the South Asian nation.\n\"The shooting erupted Tuesday night when Mansoor visited Mullah Abdullah Sarhadi in his house in the city of Quetta,\" said Sultan Faizi, the spokesman of Afghan First Vice President Abdul Rashid Dostum, in an official statement.\n\"We are unsure whether Mullah Mansoor had survived his injuries.\"\nBut members of the Afghan Taliban rejected the claim as propaganda to \"break up the group\".\n\"Mullah Mansoor is perfectly well, he is not injured. I spoke to him a while ago. This incident is propaganda to prove us weak,\" Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told Al Jazeera.\n\"Mullah Mansoor is not in Pakistan. The fight never happened. No such meeting took place in Quetta in the first place.\"\nAccording to a senior Taliban commander and close aide to Mansoor, the news was an attempt to confuse and further divide the Taliban.\n\"There are elements within Afghan government who want to divide the Taliban. Mullah Akhtar Mansoor would never go to Mullah Abdullah Sarhadi. He might have never even seen Mullah Mansoor in person his entire life,\" the commander told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.\nSami Yousafzai, a Taliban expert in the region told Al Jazeera that the Taliban is going through \"a tough time with divisions.\n\"There are a lot of problems and disagreements between the Taliban. This will definitely undermine the peace talks.\n\"There are several other groups that have emerged in Afghanistan. Many militants have pledged allegiance to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant [ISIL]. Who are they going to have peace talks with now?\n\"If the news is true about Mullah Mansoor, the Taliban might feel weak, but the challenge still remains to fight the insurgency in the country.\"\nThe news of Mansoor's injury comes after renewed efforts to revive peace talks with Taliban fighters. The talks were postponed after the announcement of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar's death earlier this year.\nMansoor was announced as the new Taliban leader late July after the group confirmed the death of Mullah Omar, who had led the Taliban for two decades.\nBut factions emerged following his appointment, with some saying the decision was not made with everyone's consent.\nLast month, the breakaway faction of the Taliban elected its own leader, Mullah Mohammed Rasool Akhund, sparking speculation over the unity of the group.\nThe spokesperson of the breakaway faction, Mullah Abdul Manan Niazi, expressed interest in peace talks last month.\nViolent clashes between the two rival Taliban groups in southern Afghanistan early last month that left several dead from both sides confirmed the rift.\nSince the withdrawal of international combat forces at the end of last year, there are about 13,000 foreign troops - roughly 10,000 of them American - in Afghanistan. The US and NATO mandate is now to train and advise Afghan security forces.\nIn October, US President Barack Obama announced that the US would extend its military role in the country and keep the current force of 9,800 troops through most of 2016, amid a surge in Taliban attacks.\nUnder the new plan, the number of US troops would fall to 5,500, starting in 2017.", "Microsoft plans to deliver the first service packs for Office 2010 and SharePoint 2010 in \"mid-summer\" 2011.The Softies also plan to deliver service pack 1 for Office 2011 for Mac the week of April 11.\nMicrosoft officials said earlier this year that the first service pack (SP1) for Office 2010/SharePoint 2010 would be out some time between May and November 2011.

Apple's MobileMe will no longer sync with MacOS Sync Services as of May 5 (or now, for those who've already moved to the new version of the MobileMe calendar). The result: Outlook 2011 SP1 calendars that sync with Sync Services on the Mac, will NOT be synced with MobileMe calendars.\nMicrosoft execs told GeekWire.com that Apple\u2019s decision to uncouple MobileMe from its Sync Services next month was \u201can unfortunate surprise\u201d to Microsoft.

Because that candidate, who this past spring sought his party's nomination for the District 15 seat that includes the Panhandle, is dealing in fear and innuendo while trying to influence the SBOE's textbook selection policy.\nRandy Rives of Odessa challenged board member Bob Craig of Lubbock in March in the Republican primary for Craig's seat.\nCraig trounced Rives by roughly 20 percentage points, primarily because Rives was deemed by Republican primary voters to represent views that do not reflect their own mainstream conservative view of education.\nRives - who once served a single term on the Odessa school board - is a friend of the so-called \"social conservative\" faction on the SBOE. And he took a proposal to the board that suggests pro-Islamic interests are forcing a curriculum that promotes Islam at the expense of Christianity.\nRives argued before the board in July that \"Middle Eastern interests\" are trying to influence textbook selection by denigrating Christianity. And on Friday, the SBOE voted narrowly to adopt a policy patterned after a resolution that is almost a verbatim transcript of Rives' testimony.\nThe issue of textbook selection in Texas should not center on whether one religion gets better treatment than another religion.\nRives reportedly took textbook passages out of context, eliminated references to such things as massacres committed by Muslims, and presented them as \"evidence\" that the books ignore atrocities commited by Muslims while highlighting those committed by Christians.\nPublic education policy need not center on this kind of nonsense. It should instead deal in facts free of bias - religious, political or otherwise.\nAs the Fort Worth Star-Telegram stated in an editorial this past Sunday, \"Reasonable people can find and should scrutinize available textbooks and debate whether they serve Texas students well in their presentations of the complicated roles the world's great religions have played throughout history.\"\nThey also can do so in ways that reveal the scars that all religions bear. And make no mistake, not a single one of the great religions is free of actions that today's practitioners have come to regret.\nPerhaps the most maddening aspect of this whole flareup is that it is being ignited by a gentleman who was rejected soundly at the ballot box by Republican voters in West Texas, arguably among the most politically conservative residents of this state.\nBut those voters recognized in March that Rives does not represent their views. They also recognized with their vote that setting public education policy shouldn't rest on the religious views of board members or those who seek to impose a certain type of theology in public school classrooms.\nThis latest tempest comes at a time of growing anti-Muslim sentiment in Texas and across the nation.

The most recent available study, which also had the largest sample and controlled for the most variables, found no effect at all--a result which surprised the hell out of its author, a former Clinton advisor. Other studies say the number is in the tens of thousands.\nThe left is predictably fond of the study which got the largest number, 45,000 a year. Unfortunately, its authors are political advocates for a single-payer system, who also helped author the notorious studies on medical bankruptcies. Those studies are very shoddily done, with parameters that somehow always conspire to produce the maximum possible number. In the first study, they set an absurdly low threshhold for what constituted a \"medical bankruptcy\". In the second, they chose 2006, the year after the 2005 bankruptcy reform act had driven an unprecedented spike in filings. It seems pretty likely that medical bankruptcies were bound to be overrepresented in 2006, since most financial events are easier to see coming than illnesses. But even if you disagree--and the authors offered an incredibly wan explanation of why they did--it's very clear that the people who filed in 2006 were not going to be a representative sample of bankruptcies in a normal year. I can't imagine why you would choose to study 2006 unless you were looking for biased results. I have to conclude that their political beliefs are affecting their work, which means I wouldn't touch that 45,000 number with a bargepole--I wouldn't cite anything they authored even if it offered to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was right about everything.\nThe right, meanwhile, shuns the subject like the plague. It will not do anyone's career any good to be attached to an argument that sounds like the health care equivalent of \"let them eat cake\".\nSo allow me, maybe, to be the first. I'm afraid I'm not confident about any number. All of these studies suffer from unobserved variable bias, which is to say, the uninsured are not like the rest of us. (The long term uninsured, I mean; the short term uninsured are not a large problem for society). There are all sorts of reasons that people end up uninsured, but most of them are correlated with much poorer health outcomes, and only some of them end up recorded in our surveys.\nTo give you an example of what I mean, one of the two studies that went into the most commonly cited number--the roughly 20,000 a year figure from the Institute of Medicine and the Urban Institute--found that the highest mortality was not associated with being uninsured, but being on a government health care program. (the other excluded those patients). This was true even after they'd run all their controls. Given that the bulk of the coverage expansion in both the Senate and the House plans comes from Medicaid expansion, this is a little disturbing.\nBut how likely is it that Medicaid is killing people? Possible, I suppose, but not really all that likely. Medicaid and Medicare patients, too, are not like the broader population. The authors in fact recognized this fact in their paper, pointing out that these patients have higher rates of disability--but then failed to address the obvious question this raised about their data on the uninsured.\nThis problem plagues almost all of the studies on mortality and the uninsured. Probably the best one looked at patients who had been taken to the ER, which still showed higher mortality for the uninsured. But it's not clear that this indicates that lacking insurance is dangerous; it may be telling us that people who lack insurance have a lot of factors that lead to poorer health outcomes.\nTo my mind probably the single most solid piece of evidence is this: turning 65--i.e., going on Medicare--doesn't reduce your risk of dying. If lack of insurance leads to death, then that should show up as a discontinuity in the mortality rate around the age of 65. It doesn't. There are some caveats--if the effects are sufficiently long term, then it's hard to measure, because of course as elderly people age, their mortality rate starts rising dramatically. But still, there should be some kink in the curve, and in the best data we have, it just isn't there.\nThat doesn't mean I'm prepared to say that no one dies from lack of insurance. The data is messy, and the studies often contradict each other. Intuitively, I feel as if there should be some effect. But if the results are this messy, I would guess that the effect is not very big. At minimum, I think we should be pretty cautious about stating that we know how many people die from lack of insurance. We don't, and worse, we may never.", "LONDON: Tesla Inc\u2019s customer referral incentive plan will end on February 1, the electric carmaker\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted on Thursday, citing costs.\nThe Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb 1.

Williams started working in the advertising business in 1969, when young African-American women like her were a rarity in the industry.\nWilliams, a creative mind behind major campaigns for such brands as Secret, Pillsbury and Walt Disney, said she had simply walked away and limited the woman\u2019s access to her after that.\nThe U.S. workplace and the ad industry have evolved strikingly since then, but perhaps not fast enough. Last week, Williams was the first African-American woman with a creative agency background \u2014 the class of executives exalted on \u201cMad Men\u201d \u2014 to be inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame, which was established in 1948.\nWilliams, the founder of Carol H. Williams Advertising, got her start at Leo Burnett in Chicago. There she coined the \u201cStrong enough for a man, but made for a woman\u201d tagline for Secret deodorant and helped sell Americans on Pillsbury canned frosting back when the boxed version was in vogue.\nHer induction comes as Madison Avenue continues to grapple with a lack of women and minorities in its top ranks and faces intensifying pressure to diversify, from advocacy groups, major brands and its own leaders.\nThe 3 Percent Conference, which supports female creative leadership at agencies, has estimated that only 11 per cent of creative directors are women, even as they account for half of the industry\u2019s workforce. For black women, the field is even tougher: Last month, the Interpublic Group publicized statistics from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission showing that fewer than one per cent of executives in advertising, public relations and related services are black women.\nPeople would execute a project because they enjoyed executing the project and the project was just that to them.

His dream has finally come true - and it's no surprise that this episode felt more like a classic Doctor Who episode from John Nathan-Turner's time as producer.\n\"Kerblam!\" exploits a traditional Doctor Who conceit, turning the everyday into something to be feared. In this case, the threat is Amazon writ large, and the villain's weapon of choice is literally explosive bubble wrap. The premise is simple enough, with a rogue human attempting to turn an automated system into a murderous weapon; the Tom Baker story \"The Robots of Death\" had a very similar conceit, and this episode seems almost like a love-letter to that particular adventure. Both stories end with the Doctor turning the villain's own weapon against him.\nSo what was Doctor Who really saying about automation? What did happen when the Doctor met Agatha Christie? Why can't the Doctor fly the TARDIS? And why was the Head of People managing reception at the Kerblam warehouse plant? We explore all the key questions and mysteries.\nNext Page: Why Can't The Doctor Fly The TARDIS - And What Is A Teleport Pulse?\n12. What Was Doctor Who Actually Saying About Automation?\nDoctor Who season 11 has been committed to social commentary, dealing with everything from gun violence in \"Arachnids in the UK\" to the battle against prejudice in \"Rosa.\" This episode lays into everything from automation to workplace bullying, from middle management to online retail. But its message is surprisingly complex; in a neat subversion, there's no high-powered corporate conspiracy, just a single rogue employee who really seems to be a twisted trade unionist.\nWhile not all the middle management are particularly pleasant, their hearts are in the right place, and they're genuinely attempting to do the best they can for their staff and company. The Doctor sums up the message of \"Kerblam!\" in her furious speech to Charlie. \"The systems aren't the problem,\" she tells him. \"How people use and exploit the system - that's the problem.\"\n11. Was The Bubblewrap A Commentary On Classic Who?\nThe classic Doctor Who series was famous for its low budget, with the production team using everyday objects to create as much a sense of terror as they could. The Giant Maggots in The Green Death, for instance, were inflated condoms; Planet of the Daleks featured a Dalek army that were really a handful of wind-up toys with mirrors placed around them; and in The Ark In Space, the crew actually did use painted bubblewrap to simulate an alien infection.\nHilariously, even the modern TARDIS exterior reflects the shoestring budget of the original series; real police boxes were made out of concrete, but Doctor Who initially made a wooden replica because it was all the show could afford. \"Kerblam!\" writer Pete McTighe is known to be a fan of the old series, so the idea of literally using plastic bubblewrap as a terrifying weapon is amusingly meta.\n10. Did Doctor Who Overestimate What It Can Do With CGI?\nPractical effects were the bane of classic science fiction, as few TV shows could afford the best - and certainly not on Doctor Who's budget. But the modern equivalent is CGI. In theory, anything is possible with CGI; in reality, just as with old-school practical effects, the best CGI is expensive. \"Kerblam!\" shows the limits of Doctor Who's CGI, most notably in the scenes where Ryan, Charlie and Yaz make their way through the delivery and packaging systems. Given \"Kerblam!\" pokes fun at old-school Who's bubblewrap monsters, there's a real sense of irony to this problem.\n9. What Did Happen When The Doctor Met Agatha Christie?\nThe Doctor has always loved a bit of name-dropping, but \"Kerblam!\" marks a rare case where she refers to a previous adventure that viewers have seen. A mention of wasps reminds the Doctor of the time she met Agatha Christie; that's a reference to the season 4 episode \"The Unicorn and the Wasp.\" In that episode, the Doctor and Donna invited themselves to a dinner party attended by the legendary author, and uncovered an alien Vespiform - a giant wasp - that was committing a string of murders. Amusingly enough, as we've already mentioned, \"Kerblam!\" is very similar to the classic Doctor Who episode \"The Robots of Death\" - appropriately, a story that was inspired by Christie's murder mysteries.\n8. Why Was The Doctor Made The Janitor, And Ryan Allocated Packing?\nThe Doctor is unimpressed when the system allocates her the role of Janitor; she prefers to find her own way to investigate, and so she uses the sonic screwdriver to switch roles around. Ironically, she was making the job a lot harder for herself; the Kerblam system wanted her to be the Janitor so she could have unrestricted access, even to the lowest levels. What's more, she'd have come into immediate contact with Charlie, the cleaner who was responsible for all the chaos. As for why Ryan, who has dyspraxia, was put in Packing? It's presumably because the Kerblam surveillance system had recorded him talking about his old job, and knew he had the right experience.\n7. How Did The Doctor And Her Friends Get Away With Doing No Work?\n\"Kerblam!\" has a lot to say about modern workplace culture, including the extent to which workers are monitored by performance management systems. In spite of that, though, the Doctor and her friends basically get away with doing whatever they want. The Doctor ditches her task pretty quickly, Ryan wanders around without a hint of his movements being checked up on, and Yaz decides to follow another worker around. Presumably the Kerblam system was secretly working to help Team TARDIS by not reporting their slackness.\nPage 2 of 2: Why Can't The Doctor Fly The TARDIS - And What Is A Teleport Pulse?", "KUALA LUMPUR: Following in the footsteps of her mother, 19-year-old Andrea Veronica Fonseka was crowned Miss Malaysia Universe 2004, 34 years after Datin Josephine Fonseka bagged the coveted title in 1970.\nThe 180cm-tall beauty beat 13 other finalists and impressed the judges with her eloquence and confidence.\nShe also won the Miss Lumimi Slim and Beauty title and the Miss Nelson Popular title.\nBEAUTY QUEENS: Datin Josephine Fonseka giving her daughter Andrea Veronica, 19, a kiss after she won the Miss Malaysia Universe 2004 Pageant in Kuala Lumpur Thursday night.

I am elated, overjoyed and every other word you can find in the thesaurus to describe happiness,\u0094 she said.\nAndrea, who had just completed her A-Levels with flying colours, had been offered to study at a few universities, but said she had not decided which varsity to enrol in.\n\u0093I am going to do law.

Two were the result of citizen initiatives, the arduous collection of 766,200 valid petitions signed by Floridians and reviewed by the state's high court.\nAll received a majority of votes; one proposal by the Legislature failed because it didn't meet the required 60 percent threshold.\nIn 2016, five proposed amendments were on the ballot: three submitted by the Legislature and two resulting from initiatives. Four were approved; one of the initiatives, strongly backed by the utilities industry, failed.\nSo, during the last two election cycles, four initiatives were on the ballot and one failed.\nYet two key committees in Florida's Republican-led House and Senate assert that the state constitution is under siege due to initiatives.\nA Judiciary Committee bill (SB 7096) would place new and questionable limits on the petition-drive and initiative processes. Chairman David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, said the restrictions and requirements are needed to preserve the \"integrity\" and \"accountability\" of initiatives. He also alleged that out-of-state interests are \"hijacking\" the constitution.\n\"This is an area that has gotten out of control,\" said Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, according to a report by John Kennedy of Gatehouse Media.\nYes, there is a long list of proposals to amend the Florida Constitution in 2020 \u2014 27 of them, to be exact.\nBut the last four years suggest that few will make the ballot and meet the 60 percent mandate.\nThe Senate and House bills would make initiatives even more difficult. They would require petition gatherers to be Florida residents, which seems vulnerable to legal challenges, and prohibit them from being paid based on the signatures collected. The bills call for petition gatherers to register with the state; SB 7096 would require that the initiative sponsors seek a finding from the Supreme Court on whether the proposal could be enacted by the Legislature.\nThe latter proposal ignores this: Many initiative-driven amendments occurred in response to the Legislature's failure to act. The voting-rights amendment overwhelmingly approved in 2018 was the result of the refusal by the Legislature and governor to restore the rights of ex-felons who paid their debt to society. Even now, the Legislature is pursuing steps to undermine voters' intent and make restoration difficult.\nThe same scenario played out with the medical marijuana amendment passed in 2016. Legislative inaction led to other amendments on school-class sizes and redistricting.\nWe believe in reasonable steps to protect the integrity of the constitution and recognize that not all initiative-driven amendments belong in the document. But the initiative process provides vital rights to voters who have generally demonstrated good judgment. These bills don't provide the protections the voters deserve.", "What is that we women are ignoring or not paying attention to?\nBeing a woman is not easy. Not only is today's woman fulfilling her traditional duties, but also taking up much more onto her plate. She is a mother, an entrepreneur, a dreamer, an achiever and also a support system for her family. In the constant flux of striking a balance between all her worlds, most often, it is her health which takes a hit. This piece aims to bring to light health and diet tips for women that shouldn't be ignored.\nAge plays a huge role for women's health and well-being. As we grow older, the body undergoes many changes. But like the saying goes, there's nothing like starting early, therefore, health experts always advise that twenties is a crucial time for women to start thinking of their health.\nA woman is in her prime during her twenties, a phase where she has a chance to build her reservoir of good health and brace-up for the many challenging experiences later on in life, such as childbirth. It is the time when she needs to start making careful health choices, as how she fares in her later years depends immensely on her twenties or even earlier. In fact, recent research studies have reported that our adolescence plays an equally crucial role.\n\"In my opinion, twenties have ceased to hold much importance in a woman's life as all health issues and complications these days have shifted backwards into the adolescence. The problem has its roots elsewhere now. PCOD/PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) is at an epidemic level and much more common in younger, school going girls these days. I feel the urban lifestyle as well as many pollutants in the environment are adding to this problem,\" shared Dr. Yuvakshi Juneja, Department of Gynecology, Moolchand hospital.\nInternational Women's Day 2019: Twenties have ceased to hold much importance in a woman's life\u200b.\nHormonal imbalance, hair fall, acne and pimples, anemia and irregular menstruation are some of the most common health issues plaguing most young girls in India. So, what is it that we women are ignoring or not paying attention to? Dr. Juneja simplifies the riddle and takes us through some important factors.\nIt is important to understand that every nutrient has something to offer to the body. You can't give importance to a few nutrients and completely skip the others, therefore a balanced diet is of great importance for the optimum efficacy of our body. \"In today's fast paced life, junk food or ready-to-eat meals have gradually replaced fresh, home-cooked, healthy food, this is the biggest bane of the age. You end up grabbing anything and gobbling it down. You have to have your glass of milk, curd, mix of nuts and fruits, dal, eggs, fresh vegetables - all of this in a day to actually say that you are consuming a balanced diet. Just monitor what you are having instead, junk, junk and more junk,\" noted Dr. Juneja. According to her, loss of essential nutrients coupled with the consumption of unhealthy food items is creating a double whammy, leading to many health issues in younger women.\nInternational Women's Day 2019: Include glass of milk, curd, mix of nuts and fruits, dal, eggs and fresh vegetables in your diet.\n\"Earlier issues like PCOD were associated with a certain strata of the society, but now it is common in women across all social and economic levels. Why do you think it is so? In my OPD, on an average 3 out of every 10 women are young and come in with symptoms of PCOD or lack of hemoglobin, we need to address this issue and it can only be rectified through proper diet,\" expressed Dr. Juneja.\nThere is an acute lack of physical activity in younger people these days, there is just no exercising whatsoever, \"many young girls are falling prey to severe back and joint issues, not to mention, obesity is another lifestyle concern leading to many more ailments,\" added Dr. Juneja. It is really important to maintain an ideal weight, monitor your diet and exercise regularly. While in office, make sure you take regular breaks every 30 minutes and monitor your caffeine intake. \"Women are more prone to iron deficiency because of the way we Indians prepare our food. Most of the iron is lost and destroyed during cooking itself, therefore it is important to include amla, pomegranate, beetroot, green leafy veggies in the diet regularly,\" said Dr. Juneja.\nInternational Women's Day 2019: Smoking and excessive drinking further aggravate the risk of ill health.\nAccording to Dr. Juneja there are a few nutrients that women should be careful of in general. Folic acid, iron, Vitamin D, B Vitamins, calcium and Vitamin E, these are extremely vital for a woman's health. Make sure you include iodine enriched salt in your diet and stay away from added sugar, processed flour (maida) or artificial flavourings in your everyday food items. Enriched milk powders can be a good way to fortify your milk drink but again, these have added sugar which means added calories.\n\"You should be very careful and observant of any change in your body. Any kind of abnormal hair growth on the face, chest or neck, sudden weight gain or weight loss, hair fall, irregular periods - all of these are warning signs, alerting you to see your gynecologist at the earliest,\" directed Dr. Juneja.\nThe key to good health irrespective of the age will always remain a combination of a well-balanced diet, proper sleep and good amount of physical exercise. Like any machine, our bodies also need proper fuel and optimum operation to make use of the same fuel efficiently.\nComments\"Another thing that is extremely important for young girls these days is of course proper education about their personal hygiene and sexual health. I meet such smart and educated girls, yet so ignorant when it comes to their personal cleanliness and sexual well-being. There needs to be more awareness about such things, we need to come out and talk about these things out in the open to avoid young girls making mistakes. Sexually transmitted diseases and vaginal/urinary tract infections are extremely common these days and it is a saddening fact, please read up, learn and educate others around,\" concluded Dr. Juneja.\nHappy International Women's Day 2019!", "Rihanna attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nHarry Styles attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nLewis Hamilton and Nicole Scherzinger attend the British Fashion Awardsat London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nKendall Jenner attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nDaisy Lowe attends the British Fashion Awards at at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nCourtney Love, Renzo Rosso and Lana Del Rey attend the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nModel Alexa Chung attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nDavid and Victoria Beckham attend the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nEmma Watson attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nActress Naomie Harris attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nRita Ora poses in the winners room at the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nModel of the year Cara Delevingne poses with her award in the winners room at the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nActress Michelle Dockery poses in the winners room at the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nKate Moss poses in the winners room at the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nEdward Enninful and Naomi Campbell attend the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nKylie Minogue attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nKarolina Kurkova attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nKarlie Kloss attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nCharlotte Gainsbourg attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nAnna Wintour and daughter Bee Shaffer attend the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nAnna Kendrick attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nEllie Goulding attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nTwiggy attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nBritish singer Lily Allen poses for pictures on the red carpet upon arrival to attend the British Fashion Awards 2014 at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.\nAlexia Niedzielski and Italian model Bianca Brandolini d'Adda at London Coliseum on Dec. 1, 2014, in London.", "Adivasi activist and journalism student Vittal Malekudiya, who was accused of carrying out pro-naxal activities, on Thursday claimed that Anti-Naxal Force (ANF) was being used to threaten tribes within Kudremukh National Park area to evict them from their lands.\nHe said that though ANF had been waiting for State government\u2019s permission to file the charge sheet in a three-year-old sedition case against him, the present Congress government accorded permission within four days. \u201cThe previous government had not accorded permission to ANF to file chargesheet against me. This year ANF filed another request on January 14 and the ruling Congress accorded the permission within four days. I got to know about the charge sheet only through a court summons.\nI have been named as sixth accused and my father as the seventh accused. The others named in the charge sheet are naxal leaders Vikram Gowda, Pradeep, John, Prabha and Sundari. I have never seen these people in my life. Moreover, I believe in democratic system and hence contesting gram panchayat elections from my village Kutlur,\u201d Vittal said.\nThe ANF officials had arrested Vittal in 2012 for being a member of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). Munir Katipalla, State President Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) accused IPS officer Alok Kumar of deliberately framing Vittal without any evidence. \u201cVittal has been fighting for basic infrastructure at places where adivasis have been living at Kudremukh region. The villagers had listed out demand, in the pamphlets, such as road, water facilities in their village and decided to boycott the elections. Later, they dropped the decision and exercised their franchise. However, the ANF collected this pamphlets and framed Vittal for being naxal sympathiser. The ANF police brutally assaulted Vittal\u2019s father in front of Alok Kumar, who was then the ANF Commander,\u201d Munir said.\nVittal alleged that the government and certain vested interests wanted to forcefully evict adivasis from their lands and ANF is being used to further their cause. \u201cThe ANF wants to spread the rumours about the existence of naxals in the area to keep getting funds. The district administration and the State government backed by vested interests want to move adivasis out of their lands. Because of this ANF is being used to force adivasis to leave their lands. In my village many adivasis have been asked to accept the package offered by the government and leave the forests,\u201d he said.\nThe chargesheet filed by the ANF lists 44 witnesses and the main accused, five naxalites, are still absconding. The ANF police have pressed charges under sections 120 (b) and 121 of IPC and sections 19 and 20 under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.", "Business application software makers, in search of fresh revenue sources, are finding that the best way to expand is through mergers and acquisitions.\nOut of the five major players in this global industry--Baan, JD Edwards, Oracle, PeopleSoft, and market leader SAP--three have either invested in, partnered with, or bought out smaller application developers in the past year to shore up their core products and build integrated enterprise applications suites.\nBaan, PeopleSoft, and SAP all made major buys in 1997. And analysts say the purchases definitely mark a trend in the industry, and they expect more in 1998.\n\"What you have are these companies trying to develop a continuous business solution...by integrating their back office applications with the front office,\" Judy Hodges, an analyst with International Data Corporation, said.\nObservers say the move represents a new drive by many companies in the industry to bring their core product into the customer services area--the front-office, which will help their presence in the electronic commerce market as well.\nIn the most recent procurement in the industry, SAP last month announced plans to buy a 50 percent share in one of Europe's leading sales force automation firms, Kiefer & Veittinger.\nSAP said it plans to combine K&V's technical resources and consulting services with its development efforts to provide corporate users with customer management applications. No specific financial terms have been disclosed.\nIn May, Baan said it would purchase Aurum, a customer relations software provider, in a stock-swap deal valued at approximately $250 million. The Dutch software firm followed up that announcement with another in August saying it planned to buy Siemens Nixdorf Information System's business software unit ALX-COMET for an undisclosed amount.\nAnd in October, PeopleSoft said it would acquire management software maker Salerno Manufacturing Systems for an undisclosed amount.\nUnder the terms of the purchase, PeopleSoft moved all nine Salerno employees, including development, support, and sales staff, to its offices in Southfield, Michigan, PeopleSoft executives said. Details of the purchase were not disclosed.\nSalerno's flagship SPM+open software will be integrated with PeopleSoft's next version of its software suite PeopleSoft 7.5, PeopleSoft said.\nAll three companies compete, along with Oracle and JD Edwards, in the global ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems market, providing packages used to automate and integrate corporate functions such as sales forecasting, inventory, control, procurement, manufacturing planning, distribution, finance, and project management.\nERP applications have become fixtures at a large majority of multinational corporations in recent years, but sales have begun to stagnate with market saturation, observers say. The major ERP vendors have devoted large resources to try to extend their core product to the front-office to make it attractive to a more diverse market.\nHodges said everyone makes out in these purchases and investments. \"It's a strategic move for both the vendors and their customers,\" because the software companies push into the front office and the customers get integrated client-server business application suites.\nAlthough most of the enterprise software makers are making these buys, others are building integrated suites by alternative means. For example, Oracle is working to develop stronger sales and marketing functions in its enterprise software offering. \"And they're spending the money internally,\" the IDC analyst pointed out.\nAs for the new year, Hodges said to look to PeopleSoft to make the next acquisition, possibly in the customer management applications arena.", "Going all in with Donald Trump wasn't a winning strategy in Arizona.

Doug Ducey \u2013 who generally resists the urge to light his hair on fire and follow Trump\u2019s nativist call to arms \u2013 and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.\nAs expected, moderate Republican women and independents weren\u2019t buying what Trump \u2013 and McSally \u2013 were selling or the way in which they were selling it.\nRepublican strategist Stan Barnes says the McSally campaign miscalculated the strength of Trump\u2019s coalition in Arizona.\n\u201cThey wagered, and I think with good reason, that the Trump coalition that won the day in 2016 would be the winner in 2018. That wager was proven wrong,\u201d he told me.\nRepublican strategist Chuck Coughlin said McSally needed to appeal to the middle, yet never changed her tone after the primary.\n\u201cKnowing that it was going to be a close election that meant Republican women and independents would play a crucial role and I never heard a consistent narration from McSally to that swing audience,\u201d Coughlin said.\nRather than returning to the moderate congresswoman who represents the state's most competitive congressional district \u2013 the one who, for example, once looked for doable solutions to actually fix our immigration system \u2013 McSally kept herself joined at the hip with a president more interested in stoking fear and stirring up the base than in solving problems.\nTrump, of course, is always going to be Trump. But McSally decided to also be Trump, and it was a bad look.\nMeanwhile, Sinema not only embraced the middle. She dumped on her own party, and it was an exceedingly good look.\nOne more aimed at actually solving problems.\nOnce upon a time, McSally was the sort of Republican who could appeal to voters sick to death of partisan trench warfare, a moderate who might have survived a blue wave, had she been able to survive a GOP primary, and glided into the Senate.\nOnce upon a time, the Republican Party was the party of the big tent. It held the franchise on the center-right. Now the word \u201cmoderate\u2019 is dismissed by the base as a dirty four-letter concoction best uttered with a snear: RINO.\nLast week, Democrats won five of nine U.S. House seats in Arizona. They won a U.S. Senate seat they haven\u2019t come within striking distance of touching in 30 years.\nThey came within two seats of taking over the state House \u2013 closer than at any time since the 1960s.\nThey snagged at least two and possibly three statewide offices from what has been an all-Republican slate since 2012.\nAnd Kyrsten Sinema won the state\u2019s largest county, Republican-rich Maricopa.\nRepublicans don\u2019t need to be looking for evidence of fraud. They need to be in frantic search of a bigger tent and a broader appeal.\nNow, before that once-big tent collapses into the size of a pup tent.", "Veteran shoots six dead and barricades himself in a home, police warn man, named as Bradley Stone, should be considered \"armed and dangerous\"\nSix people have been killed and one seriously wounded by a solitary gunman in a shooting rampage in Pennsylvania.\nThe suspected gunman, named by the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office as Bradley William Stone, 35, was reportedly barricaded in a home at Pennsburg, nearly 50 miles north of Philadelphia.\nAll the victims including, it is understood, Stone's ex wife, Nicole Hill, were reported to have been shot at close range.\nIn a statement posted on its Facebook page, the DA's office said: \"Stone should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone with information about Stone\u2019s whereabouts is asked to call 9-1-1 immediately.

That company has earned approximately $2.2 billion in government contracts since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began in 2003.\nThat price tag seems especially high given that it only covered \u201cno more than five to 10\u201d staffers, the letter said.\nBy comparison, housing staff in the US Embassy in Afghanistan would have cost, at maximum, $1.8 million. Housing those staffers on a military base would have little or nothing extra.\nSapko\u2019s letter points the blame at Paul Brinkley, the task force chief allegedly responsible for approving expenditures. Sapko also claims that Brinkley has been uncooperative during SIGAR\u2019s investigation.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that TFBSO has come under fire for inappropriate spending. The task force faced scrutiny last month for spending $43 million for an Afghan gas station that should have cost $500,000. Brinkley himself was the subject of a military investigation in 2007 for alleged financial mismanagement in Iraq.\n\u201cThis letter raises troubling questions that have become all too familiar when we\u2019re talking about how taxpayer money is spent on projects in Afghanistan,\u201d Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill said, according to USA Today.\nMcCaskill, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has called for greater transparency in Pentagon spending.", "God of War is a game about getting angry. It tasks you with laying waste to anyone in Ancient Greece, god, man or monster, who has done so much as even look at you funny.\nThe series looked like it had come to an end with God of War III on PS3, as its protagonist, Kratos, had pretty much put an end to all things Mount Olympus-related. Instead then, God of War: Ascension, is all about Kratos's rise to power and his breaking free from Ares, while smashing up plenty of things along the way.\nBefore we get into the review, know this, God of War: Ascension is a proper send off for the PS3. Graphically it finally does justice to those renders we saw all those years ago when the PS3 launched and leaves us wondering just how stunning the PS4 will look six years into its life cycle.\nThe game starts with Kratos chained up, left at the mercy of one of the Furies whom he must defeat in order to break the bond he has with Ares. As you might expect, this being a God of War game, Kratos's idea of defeating the Furies involves wreaking havoc across Greece in order to rip the heads off and break the bones of his captors.\nThe initial battle, which is absolutely incredible in its scale, leads to an epic journey which sees Kratos engaging in more modest fights compared to previous games. We don't want to give things away, but the sheer grandeur of previous titles is slightly lost here, not because the environments aren't spectacular, but more because the enemies are smaller in scale.\nThe younger Kratos in Ascension is more human, and given a slightly more conversational dialogue with other characters on screen. This dialogue, however, is sparse, leading to the game world feeling severely unpopulated. This is a bit of a signature of the series, but if Santa Monica Studios' intention with Ascension was to develop Kratos's character, it does make things slightly difficult.\nIn reality, the story in Ascension is fairly forgettable, acting more as a means to justify environments and push gameplay forward. It lacks some of the exciting characters found in God of War III, such as Hades and the Titans, but given how finite the ending was of the last game, the story does a good job developing the world of God of War.\nThe gameplay of God of War is what makes the series so great. Kratos feels so pumped, so devastating, that controlling him is always enjoyable. His Blades of Olympus act like a pair of whips which you can twirl about, inflicting pain on those around you.\nThey form the core of the whole gameplay experience and allow you to build up easily executable yet highly complex combos. Button combos are as simple as hitting or holding square or triangle, while using L1 as a modifier to add more power to your stabs and swipes. On top of this, you can shift elemental types with the blades by using the directional pad, or use R2 to bring in devastating magic and clear enemies away, should they start to overwhelm.\nAscension sees the return of the Rage meter, which fills the bigger and badder your combos get. Max it out and you can hit L3 and R3, granting Kratos an increased power and amount of damage dealt. Take a hit though and your Rage will stop, so using the right stick to dodge is vital.\nIt is all about building up a rhythm, attacking and dodging along the way. Once you nail the combat mechanics in God of War, the game becomes incredibly enjoyable. Kratos does damage with such a heavy hand and leaps about so quickly, that you genuinely start to feel like the sort of character that could give a Greek god a run for its money.\nWe would have liked to see a bit more fluctuation from the tried and tested methods of the series and perhaps a larger selection of weaponry to play with, but really we don't blame Santa Monica studios for its \"if it ain't broke\" approach.\nGod of War: Ascension is the first game in the series to feature a multiplayer mode. It tasks you with battling eight players either in teams or by yourself. You pick a god, or play style and then start smashing other people up online.\nIt is pretty much a points chasing exercise, with a fairly convoluted UI that can be a bit overbearing at times. Capture the Flag is an interesting aside, but really, the staple Favour of the Gods mode is the best multiplayer option.\nTrials of the Gods is a \"horde\" mode style, wave-based co-op mode, which is definitely enjoyable when played with friends. Really though, God of War's multiplayer is more an addition than a must-play option.\nThis is a very good -looking game. That engine from God of War III has been given quite an overhaul and now you have a slowdown, free, stunning in-scale PS3 game.\nEnvironments are massive, with high-resolution textures cropping up at every possible opportunity. Kratos also looks fantastic and the elemental effects as well as clever camera tweaks employed later on, are also brilliant.\nThis really is a send-off to the PS3 and shows just how innovative and impressive a console it has been. For a game still to have jaw-dropping graphics with the likes of Crysis 3 about, is very special indeed. We can't wait to see what Santa Monica Studios can manage to eek out from Sony's new console.\nGod of War: Ascension has lots of boxes ticked. It plays and looks great and delivers a gameplay experience worthy of the series.\nThe problem is, that it just doesn't take things forward enough, which is irritating when you see how incredible a job its developers have done with looks and design. We just would have hoped to see a slight format change for this, Kratos's final adventure on PS3.\nReally though, it is a title PS3 owners must play. If you have had a bad day at work, put God of War: Ascension into your PS3 and do some damage - it will put a big, fat smile on your face.", "Plenty of specialized companies out there sell PCs with Linux, but Dell is one of the very few mainstream contenders to have done so over the years. After some spotty initial offerings, it's taken a different approach with its latest Linux PC. Rather than try to sell Linux hardware to the masses, which the company has said typically requires support, it's focusing instead on developers, a savvy group that tends to need less help.\nThat's the plan behind the $1,549 Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, an ultrabook that was born via the company's \u201cProject Sputnik\u201d skunkworks initiative last year combining Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Long Term Support Precise Pangolin and the company's existing XPS 13 laptop.\nWhat started out as a pilot project turned into a real commercial product last fall, and earlier this year it got a nice upgrade. We got our hands on one recently and put this latest model through its paces.\nVisually, the Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition is a thing of beauty. It's thin, sleek, and lightweight, weighing in at just under 3 pounds. With a top cover precision-cut from a single block of aluminum, the silver-toned machine features a carbon-fiber composite base surrounded with a ring of matching anodized aluminum. A comfortable magnesium palm rest features soft-touch paint.\nPowering the Linux ultrabook is a third-generation Intel Core i7 processor with Intel HD Graphics 4000, 8GB dual channel DDR3L RAM, and a 256GB SSD drive. That's a nice setup for the kinds of compute-intensive tasks developers spend much of their time on, including repeated cycles of coding, compiling, testing, and debugging.\nThe XPS 13 Developer Edition we tested has a third-generation Intel Core i7 processor with Intel HD Graphics 4000, 8GB dual channel DDR3L RAM, and a 256GB SSD drive.\nDevelopers will also often have many windows open, so the fact that this machine sports a full 8GB of RAM rather than the standard XPS 13's starting point of 4GB eases the burden by minimizing swapping to disk, thereby improving overall responsiveness.\nThe 13.3-inch edge-to-edge glossy display, meanwhile, is constructed from hardened Gorilla Glass and offers full High Definition WLED, 1080p resolution, and a full 178\u00b0 viewing angle. So compact is the PC's design, however, that it actually feels a lot more like an 11-inch laptop in overall size.\nThe backlit, full-sized keyboard is another visually appealing element, though we found it a bit too light to the touch. That's personal preference, of course. Much more striking, though, was the fact that it featured a Windows superkey rather than an Ubuntu one.\nWhile it's not a performance issue, the presence of a Windows-specific key on this device underscores the fact that this is still essentially Dell's standard XPS 13 with Ubuntu simply preinstalled. Developers wouldn't have any trouble doing that installation themselves, so we were alert to other distinguishing features that would set this device apart for this Linux-minded crowd.\nOne such feature is the XPS 13 Developer Edition's full year of included Dell ProSupport and onsite service after remote diagnostics. Also included on the device, meanwhile, are two USB 3.0 ports (one with PowerShare), a mini DisplayPort, and a headset jack. No mouse was included, so we added our own.\nLike many Linux machines, this one featured a nice, snappy startup; it can boot from cold in as little as 13.5 seconds, Dell says.\nWe did encounter an issue by which the installer crashed the first time around, but on the second attempt it worked like a charm. WiFi connected on the first try, so we got to work installing some extras, including Chrome, GIMP, and Shutter for taking screenshots.\nFeaturing the Unity desktop, Ubuntu 12.04 offers a user-friendly Linux experience.\nWe were both already familiar with Ubuntu and the Unity desktop, so that part was immediately comfortable. Since this machine is aimed at developers, however, we were particularly interested to see what developer tools were included. Those available upon startup were the Bazaar version control system, the IcedTea Web Control Panel, IcedTea Java Web Start, a printing configuration tool, and the UbuntuOne cloud service.\nHandy for our review-writing purposes was that LibreOffice was installed and ready to go. Even more joy-inspiring was the absence of the vast array of OEM bloatware you'll typically find on most Windows machines.\nWe were surprised, however, to find no sign of two particular developer tools Dell has been talking about since the Sputnik project began. Namely, neither the cloud launcher nor the profile tool that have figured so prominently in the Developer Edition plans were evident on the laptop.\nIt turns out both are still essentially in alpha form and currently hosted on GitHub.\nDell's widely anticipated cloud launcher and profile tool are not yet included on the XPS 13 Developer Edition.\nSome initial work has been done on the profile tool, but Dell ended up taking a break to focus on launching the machine, it said. \u201cWe have just started up again,\u201d the briefing notes explained.\nIn the meantime, the XPS 13 Developer Edition comes with VirtualBox preinstalled as well as Juju, a transitional package for Ruby 1.8, Python, and more.\nIs there a need for a machine aimed specifically at Linux developers? We're not so sure. Most developers are more than capable of stripping any machine of its original OS and installing what they want themselves.\nThat said, however, this is a decent start. With its i7 processor and 8GB of RAM, it's equipped to handle most of what developers will throw at it. In fact, the BIOS supports Intel-VT \u201cbare-metal\u201d hypervisor virtualization, lending itself to setting up virtual machine instances that run at near hardware spec performance levels, such as using Linux\u2019s 64-bit kernel built-in KVM Type 1 hypervisor.\nTypically programmers will set up their own \u201ctest beds\u201d as virtual machines. Using Btrfs, for example, programmers can \u201csnapshot\u201d the virtual machine, make testing programmatic changes to the configuration, and if need be \u201croll-back\u201d to the snapshot taken beforehand.\nMeanwhile, Dell clearly knows that developers have their own unique preferences. The tool selection provided should be considered a starting point but not complete for any specific purpose. No two programmers have the same set of use cases and needs. Instead, what they look for are reliability and performance metrics. After all, many programmers write with operating-system-agnostic tools that can be used on any hardware platform.\nThe XPS 13 Developer Edition has competition: Lenovo\u2019s ThinkPad, Apple\u2019s MacBook Retina or Air, or Google's Chromebook Pixel. These machines aren't customized for Linux work, but they're technically superior in construction and software certification, and it's nothing for developers to strip what's there and install any operating system they want. It will be interesting, however, to revisit this device once it's fully loaded with all the developer tools Dell has planned.", "INDEPENDENCE: Cavaliers rookie Anthony Bennett, the top overall pick in the NBA Draft, will not compete in the Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star weekend Feb. 14-16, becoming the second top pick not to be invited since the game\ufffds inception and the first since Kwame Brown in 2001.\nDion Waiters was the only Cavs player invited after they sent four players to the game last season.\nBennett played 31 minutes in Tuesday\ufffds loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, easily his most extensive time this season.

Readers\u2019 responses to that column indicated strong interest in protecting the monarchs that overwinter in the Monterey Bay Area, enhancing our environment. Readers also called for additional details about ways to help the monarchs.\nButterfly Bush (Buddlea x weyriana). This is a hybrid cultivar that blooms in October and produces much nectar.\nDaisy Tree (Montanoa Grandiflora). A native of Mexico, this woody shrub grows to eight feet or more, and produces a cloud of fragrant white flowers that bloom from late October to late November, just when the Monarchs need nectar.\nMallow (Lavatera assurgentiflora). Another woody shrub, this California native produces red flowers year-round.\nYellow Daisy (Euryops pectinatatus \u2018viridis\u2019). This South African native is a mainstay for the Monarchs, blooming year-round with bright yellow daisy flowers. It\u2019s also not attractive to deer.\nAs noted earlier, milkweed is essential to the wellbeing of monarch caterpillars. This plant contains toxins known as cardenolides. Monarchs are immune to these toxins, and have evolved to store them in their bodies. The toxin makes them poisonous to birds, which avoid eating the monarchs. Without this protection, birds would be major (but not the only) predators of the monarchs.\nThe adult monarchs always deposit their eggs on milkweed plants, so that the larvae begin immediately to eat the plants and accumulate the toxin in their bodies.\nThe Western Monarchs mate around January, lay their eggs at a wide range of sites throughout the American west, and return to the Pacific coast to overwinter during a four-month period. In the Monterey Bay area, the familiar overwintering sites are at Natural Bridges State Beach and Pacific Grove.\nMilkweeds are needed where the monarchs lay their eggs. Milkweed grows naturally in Monarch breeding areas, but not at the overwintering sites on California\u2019s central or northern coastal areas. The migration cycle moves between the breeding areas to the overwintering sites. Planting milkweed close to overwintering sites could encourage Monarchs to breed and lay eggs during the winter, and thereby disrupt the migration cycle. Given this concern, the Xerces Society and other experts recommend that milkweed should not be planted with 5 to 10 miles of an overwintering site.\nThe milkweed genus Asclepias includes over 200 species. California native species that grow naturally near the Western Monarchs\u2019 home territory are preferred.\n3. Avoid Tropical Milkweed (A. curassavica), which is evergreen, but which allows development of a protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrho) that harms or even kills Monarchs that eat the plant.\nGardeners in the Monterey Bay area who wish to improve the Monarchs\u2019 habitat should emphasize the planting of nectar-producing plants more than milkweed. Those plants are good for bees, as well. This would be a good year to plant annual seeds in the early spring.", "A new study by F5 Networks finds that businesses are moving toward hybrid clouds and that there is still a lot of concern when it comes to security.\nF5 asked respondents about 24 different cloud application services in areas such as security, identify and access, and found that every respondent used at least one, while 60 percent used 10 or more. Thirty percent used all 24, which illustrates the growing use of the cloud.\nFour of the top five services used were security-related: 83 percent used network firewalls, 81 percent antivirus, 75 percent SSL VPN and 72 percent anti-spam to detect and stop unsolicited email.\nWhat Services Could People Not Live Without?\nRespondents said they would not deploy an application without security and availability services, both of which tied for the top spot at 32 percent. Other services have limited value if the application is not available and secure, F5 officials said.\nF5 asked businesses what services they would be willing to give up to make the network more secure. Only 4 percent said availability, while 8 percent said performance. They also didn't want to get rid of programmability.\nWhat's on Tap for 2016?\nTwenty-six percent of respondents said they planned to deploy DNSSEC (Domain Name System security) and identity federation services this year, while 24 percent said their priorities were server load balancing, single sign-on and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), another indication of the trend toward multiple or hybrid cloud environments.\nEighty-one percent of respondents said they plan to embrace hybrid clouds for greater flexibility and cost savings, while 20 percent said they expect to migrate more than half of their applications to the cloud.\nOver the next two to five years, private clouds will have a strategic importance, said 43 percent of respondents. That was followed by software-as-a-service (SaaS) at 40 percent and public clouds (34 percent).\nThe applications most likely to be deployed in managed clouds are distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection (32 percent), anti-spam (29 percent), global server load balancing (28 percent), DNSSEC (27 percent) and identity federation (25 percent).\nWhat would it take to convince respondents to adopt the cloud? Seventy-one percent said having data that is stored in the cloud being encrypted, and 51 percent said that having data encrypted as its travels across the Internet.\nThe biggest concern, 58 percent of respondents said, are increasingly sophisticated attacks. Fifty-two percent pointed to employees not understanding the importance of following security policies, while other issues were the complexity of security solutions (42 percent), security budgets that are too small (41 percent) and data loaded from personal device via cloud-based apps (37 percent).\nPeople who are the most confident in shielding against an attack protect multiple attack surfaces: 57 percent protect clients, 53 percent protect requests and 44 percent protect responses.\nSoftware-defined networking and DevOps are increasingly seen as important for enabling automation and orchestration.\nIn the Americas, 29 percent of respondents said SDN will be strategically important in the next two to five years. That feeling jumps to 41 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and 38 percent in the Asia-Pacific region.\nForty-three percent of respondents said private clouds are strategically important, while 34 said the same for public clouds. Within each model, SDN and DevOps have varying levels of importance.\nOf the respondents, 67 percent said they are using one to two frameworks, while 19 percent said they were using three frameworks, 10 percent are using four frameworks and 4 percent are using five or more.", "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2013 Ex-Ohio State and NFL quarterback Art Schlichter violated his bond conditions in a fraud case by twice testing positive for cocaine and by refusing several times to provide urine samples, according to a federal probation officer.\nThe former star, whose NFL career was derailed by a gambling addiction, made a brief court appearance Thursday following his arrest at his central Ohio residence a day earlier.\nA U.S. magistrate judge outlined the allegations for Schlichter, who said he understood the charges but didn&apos;t say anything else.\nJust two days ago, in asking for permission for Schlichter to see a doctor, public defender Steve Nolder wrote in a court filing, \"Since his release, Schlichter has assiduously complied with the stringent conditions of his pretrial supervision that are in place.\"\nSchlichter, 51, pleaded guilty last year to federal fraud charges stemming from a million-dollar ticket scheme.

They are the first decentralized currency. There are a finite number of bitcoins - 21 million exist and they are predicted to last until 2140. The value of the bitcoin is constantly fluctuating and bitcoin technical analysis is required in order to know when to buy and sell this currency. There are currently several online currency exchanges available where one can exchange dollars, euros and other currencies for bitcoins. Bitcoins are traded primarily through bitcoin brokers and reliable Forex brokers that offer bitcoin trading as one of their assets. Read our bitcoin broker reviews below before deciding which bitcoin broker to use.\nCryptocurrency trading is fairly easy to learn and can be profitable from the first trade. With millions of traders worldwide looking to jump on the crypto bandwagon, you can set yourself apart from the pack by taking time to understand the way the market works and to learn the technical factors that push the prices higher or lower. Setting up a demo account and practicing there before investing with real money can help protect you from losses. Though you may feel pressured to enter the market NOW, when things are hot, it\u2019s worthwhile to take some time to practice so that you can get a feel for the flow, as cryptocurrency trading, and bitcoin trading specifically, doesn\u2019t act like fiat currency trading. Taking a few days to teach yourself can protect your account in the long run.\nWhat to look for in a bitcoin broker?\nRegulation: It\u2019s important to deposit with a broker that is regulated so that your money will be protected in the event of an emergency. Not every cryptocurrency broker is regulated (and at the time of this writing, not every exchange is regulated either).\nCustomer support: Many traders need assistance throughout their trading process, but not every bitcoin broker offers reliable support and fast response times. Before depositing, check the support policies with your broker of interest. Does it offer chat support? Phone support? Email assistance? Make sure that you\u2019ll be able to get the answers you need when you need them.\nInitial Deposit: Some brokers require a large minimum deposit while others have no minimum, or low minimum deposit requirements. Don\u2019t feel pressured to choose a bitcoin broker whose deposit is too high for you \u2013 you will be able to find one that can meet your needs. Just make sure that you don\u2019t trade with money that you can\u2019t afford to lose.\nCharges and fees: In order to entice bitcoin traders, many bitcoin brokers promise \u2018no commissions\u2019 on cryptocurrency trading. Make sure to read the fine print to determine if there are rollover fees for overnight positions or other hidden fees that can take a bite out of your profits.\nLeverage: Most brokers limit the leverage offered on cryptocurrency trading due to the high volatility of the assets. If leverage is offered, it can range from 2:1 to 30:1. Take care not to use too much leverage as strong movements against your position can cause irrevocable damage to your account.\nFree demo account: Cryptocurrency brokers, as compared with cryptocurrency exchanges, usually offer a free demo where you can test your trading strategies before depositing. Take time to take advantage of this offering \u2013 it\u2019ll help you stay focused and profitable in the long run.\nTrading platform: There are dozens of bitcoin trading platforms available, from the standard MetaTrader 4 to proprietary platforms built by individual brokers. You can choose between web platforms or downloadable options, or a combination of both. Don\u2019t be afraid to test out different platforms to see which one works best for you.\nEducational materials: There is so much to say about bitcoin trading, and about cryptocurrency trading in general, but not every broker has taken the time to provide these insights to its traders. Consider whether you need to learn more before trading, or whether you\u2019ve already got the knowledge you need. If your broker doesn\u2019t offer the educational materials you seek, it may not be the right broker for you.\nThere are several ways to make money trading bitcoin, most of which is done when trading this virtual currency against the US dollar (in market terms this trade is known as the BTC/USD pair). The first (and perhaps the easiest) is to find a top bitcoin broker and invest in the digital currency in the same way you would a physical currency \u2013 buy low and sell high. Since bitcoin is an extremely volatile currency you should be able to identify the dips with a bit of studying and bitcoin research.\nBitcoin research can be done on both the fundamental and technical levels (or both, of course). On the technical level, bitcoin technical trends tend to stretch about a year at a time so it shouldn't be impossible to identify and make your trade accordingly. On the fundamental level, traders must look at the number of bitcoin traders, the number of wallets being used and the volume of bitcoin trades to determine what they think the currency should be worth \u2013 and then trade accordingly. Though it's certainly possible to make money trading bitcoin in this way, it's definitely more speculative.\nNo matter what strategy you use to trade bitcoin it's important to make sure that you have chosen the best bitcoin broker to invest with. Don't forget to compare the spreads of different bitcoin brokers to make sure you won't be paying fees that are too high, and the execution time to ensure you'll be getting the price you want. You may also want to consider the leverage available for bitcoin trading so that you can increase your risk/reward ratio and your chances for profit. Most of all we recommend that you make sure to choose a regulated bitcoin broker so that your money will be secure at all times.\n\u201cCryptocurrency mania\u201d is in full swing, and it shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon. It\u2019s perfectly normal or you to want to get in on the action, and to find profits on cryptocurrencies when possible. Make sure to remember that as quickly as prices rise, they can also fall, and that there are several strong technical indicators that can be used to predict market directions for cryptocurrencies. The DailyForex team has tested many of the top cryptocurrency brokers and given you our findings to help you make a confident, informed decision about which broker is right for you, so that you can trade intelligently and comfortably during these exciting times.", "Campbell Memorial Elementary/Middle School will host its March Madness community night from 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday in the school cafeteria.

That\u2019s both true and untrue. The case looks pretty much the same, the screen sizes didn\u2019t change, and the entry-level model still has a paltry 16GB of storage. But inside it\u2019s an all-new iPhone with some impressive new capabilities.\nI got hands-on time with the new models, and even though the presentation didn\u2019t blow me away, the new 3D Touch and Live Photos features deliver a delightful experience.\n\u201cWhat is a picture?\u201d pondered Phil Schiller on stage. After more than an hour and a half of keynote, this wasn\u2019t a philosophical debate I was excited about having. But he had a point: A photo is a still image of a moment, but a moment can have a beginning, middle, and end that one frame can\u2019t always fully represent. Enter Apple\u2019s new Live Photo feature. It's on by default in the main Camera app, and if you leave it on, it automatically captures 1.5 seconds of, er, moments before and after your shutter press.\nFlipping through the Live Photos in the Camera Roll, you\u2019ll see just a glimpse of the animation\u2014it's just enough motion to let you distinguish a Live Photo from a standard one. When you press harder on a Live Photo (a maneuver Apple calls 3D Touch on the new iPhones), you\u2019ll see the full three seconds of motion.\nI have a 3-year-old, and a lot of my photos of him wind up blurry because at least some part of his body is in motion virtually all of the time\u2014the boy is a walking wiggle. I don\u2019t think you get to scrub through a Live Photo frame by frame and pick out the single still image that\u2019s not blurry, but getting to see an animation of one of his wiggles would beat any blurry photo, or a picture where his eyes are closed.\nDevelopers will get to use Live Photos too\u2014Facebook is working on supporting Live Photos, aiming to finish by the end of this year. But even if they never leave the iPhone itself, Live Photos are just delightful. You can even use one as your lock screen wallpaper, and then 3D Touch it to make it move.\n3D Touch, you ask? Yup, that\u2019s the other big feature exclusive to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. It works just like Force Touch on the Apple Watch\u2014you press harder, like you\u2019re trying to push right through the screen, and that\u2019s a different kind of touch than a regular swipe or tap. This will let you interact with apps (from Apple and third parties) in new ways.\n3D icons on the home screen for some quick shortcuts, like to your three most recent contacts.\nFor example, you can 3D Touch icons on the home screen for shortcuts to certain features: The Facebook icon hides shortcuts for changing your status or checking in, while the Camera app\u2019s icon holds options for taking a selfie or shooting a new video. If you attempt to use 3D Touch on an icon that doesn\u2019t support it (like Health), you\u2019ll see the icon pop a little to let you know that the 3D Touch did in fact register, but nothing else is going to happen.\nHere's the \"peek,\" a preview of a Mail message. Don't lift your finger or it'll go away, so not quite as handy as Quick Look in OS X, for example.\n3D Touch gets even cooler once you open apps. You can use it to preview a new message in Mail, but it\u2019s not quite as handy as Quick Look in OS X, because the preview disappears when you lift your finger back off the screen. During my hands-on time, I found myself 3D Touching a message, and then lifting my thumb to see what it says. But of course, the message preview vanishes, so I 3D Touch it again. And again, and again. It would be quicker to just tap the message to open it.\nSwipe the peek right to mark a message as read, or left to delete it. The action happens the second you lift your finger.\nBut the preview isn\u2019t really for reading, it\u2019s for quick triage. Apple calls the first preview the \u201cpeek,\u201d and if you don\u2019t lift your finger, you can swipe up, left, or down for options. Swipe right to mark the message as read\u2014you\u2019ll see a Mark As Read option as the preview slides to the right to remind you what will happen when you lift your finger.\nSwipe left to delete the message. Swiping the message up produces buttons to reply, forward, flag, remind you about the message later, or move it elsewhere. Since you need to tap those buttons separately, the swipe-up move does fix the preview window in place.\nSwipe the preview up for the rest of your options. Now you can lift your finger in order to tap one of these buttons\u2014the preview will stay onscreen while you decide.\nAfter the \u201cpeek,\u201d if you continue to press hard, you\u2019ll open the message, a move Apple calls the \u201cpop.\u201d If you peek and don\u2019t pop, the message doesn\u2019t get marked as read, so peeking in is a quick way to see if an email is the droid you\u2019re looking for without having to go back and mark it as unread if it wasn\u2019t.\n3D Touch does tons of things in Messages, too: Hard-press a name for options to call, FaceTime, add to contacts, and so on. Hard-press URLs to peek at them, and again to pop into Safari. Hard-press street addresses to see them on a map, or dates to make a calendar appointment. This should prevent a lot of switching back and forth between apps when you\u2019re making plans with groups of friends.\nSafari's Reading List will never be more than a 3D Touch away.\nAs with Live Photos, the 3D Touch feature is open to developers. For example, Facebook\u2019s app icon has shortcuts to post a new status or check in right from your home screen. Instagram lets you 3D Touch everything, peeking into thumbnails and user profiles anywhere in the app. I asked if 3D Touch could be used to provide haptic feedback for an iPhone keyboard, and the rep didn\u2019t think that was in the API just yet, but wasn\u2019t totally sure. Still, even as it is today, I think 3D Touch has the potential to make Apple\u2019s large-screened phones easier to navigate with one hand.\nEarly adopters of the Apple Watch had mixed feelings about Force Touch on that device. It\u2019s unbelievably handy, but not exactly intuitive\u2014there\u2019s definitely a long learning curve before your brain remembers where to Force Touch and what you\u2019ll find once you do, since every app can use it differently. In my short hands-on time with the iPhone, I had the same problems, but hopefully once the iPhone 6s is in my possession full-time, 3D Touch will quickly become second nature.\nThe iPhone\u2019s rear iSight camera has been upgraded to 12 megapixels, and can shoot 4K video. The improved FaceTime camera on the front can take 5-megapixel stills. I didn\u2019t get to fully test either in the demo room, of course, but the shutter speed is crazy fast, and zooming in on the demo photos on each device revealed tons of detail. Panoramas are up to 63 megapixels now, and I love how their dedicated album in iOS 9 shows you the whole panorama in each thumbnail.\nBesides the new cameras, though, the hardware is nearly the same. The second-generation Touch ID home button works faster, according to Apple, so we\u2019ll do some side-by-side tests when we get our iPhone 6s review unit. The new rose gold color is really nice in person, and Apple was smart to release it alongside a rose gold-colored aluminum Apple Watch Sport, so you can match colors without having to mortgage your home for a rose gold Apple Watch Edition.\nRose gold is really pretty.\nThe iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are ever-so-slightly thicker than the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but only by two-tenths of a millimeter, so definitely not noticeable when you\u2019re holding them. Cases for the new phones should fit the old phones, and cases for the old phones should fit the new ones, depending on their design and materials. All the buttons and ports are in the same place, and so is the camera.\nPreorders start September 12, with the phones launching in the U.S. and 11 other countries starting September 25. We\u2019ll have a full review up as soon as we can\u2014post your questions in the comments and we\u2019ll do our best to answer them!", "Yasser Arafat's political career is almost as old as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict itself, making him an architect and symbol of his people's struggle for independence and statehood.\nThat has been his goal ever since he became fully involved with the Palestinian cause at the age of 17. At the time, he reportedly smuggled weapons to the Palestinians from Egypt, two years before the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into Arab and Israeli states.\nThe proclamation triggered the first Arab-Israeli war, which broke out on 14 May 1948.\nToday, Arafat is the Chairman of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) \u2013 a position he has held since 1996 after being the only candidate elected by an overwhelming majority.\nArafat\u2019s July 1994 return to the West Bank and Gaza Strip after 27 years in exile was made possible after the Oslo peace agreements with Israel were reached in 1993.\nThose agreements established limited Palestinian self-rule over those territories in return for acknowledging Israel's right to exist - far short of Arafat's and most Palestinians' dream of establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe Oslo accords were the product of secret meetings in Norway between Arafat and Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. The three men shared the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1994.\nArafat is the only leader many Palestinians have ever known and over the years he has managed to transform himself from a guerrilla fighter to a politician \u2013 shifting his focus from military to diplomatic efforts.\nIn 1956, Arafat founded Al-Fatah, the Palestinian National Liberation Movement \u2013 which later became the biggest group within the Palestine Liberation Organisation, PLO.\nThe PLO\u2019s Covenant altered in 1968 \u2013 a year after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war \u2013 demanded the establishment of a Palestinian state on the entire territory of the Land of Israel.\nAnd it was during that year that Arafat became leader of the PLO which, along with Fatah, advocated \"armed struggle\" to liberate Palestine. They took up arms against the Israeli army, hijacked airliners and carried out anti-Israel attacks.\nIt was not too long until Amman objected to PLO activity being launched from Jordanian soil. The 1970 Black September clashes between Palestinians and Jordanians were the final straw.\nThe group moved to Lebanon in 1971 where it settled for just over a decade before being forced to leave when Israel invaded the country in 1982. After that, the leadership and many fighters settled in Tunisia.\nBut these setbacks did not prevent Arafat from receiving world recognition as the legitimate spokesman for the Palestinian people.\nIn 1974, he addressed the United Nations General Assembly which recognised the right of the Palestinians to independence and self-determination.\nThe PLO obtained observer status at the UN - marking the beginning of Arafat's bid to transform himself from fighter to statesman.\nThe 1980s witnessed a radical shift in the course of the struggle. Arafat came to the conclusion the Palestinians would not be able to achieve statehood using military means.\nAt its nineteenth session, held in Algiers in November 1988, the Palestine National Council proclaimed the State of Palestine, recognised UN resolutions 181, 242 and 338 and affirmed its condemnation of terrorism.\nArafat\u2019s speech to the UN a month after that session confirmed the PLO\u2019s support for the right of all parties to live in peace \u2013 Israel included. This opened a new page in relations with Washington which agreed to start a dialogue with the organisation.\nWhile gaining credibility in the West, the Palestinian leader made enemies in Palestinian and Arab ranks for recognising Israel\u2019s right to exist \u2013 many of them remain his opponents until this day.\nBut Arafat paid heavily when he supported Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War, damaging the status of the Palestinians and losing vital economic assistance from the oil-rich Gulf states.\nThree years later, however, the peace process made headway with the historic signing of the Oslo accords.\nOslo was a watershed in the history of the Palestinian struggle. It established a framework for an agreement aimed at bringing peace \u2013 albeit an unjust peace - to the region.\nSubsequent peace agreements, a bumpy peace process, violence and unresolved issues like the fate of Jerusalem and the right to return for Palestinian refugees have made that peace more elusive than ever.\nArafat continues to face political opposition from factions that reject the Oslo accords \u2013 most prominently the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas.\nFrom the outset, Hamas objected to recognising Israel's existence. It has taken the lead in carrying out anti-Israel attacks especially in the second Palestinian intifadah which began in September 2000.\nIts \"armed option\" has made it more popular among Palestinians who feel short-changed by their leader's promise of independence and improved socio-economic conditions.\nHamas has become a serious challenger to Arafat's popularity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip - endangering his tenous grip on the leadership.\nDespite internal opposition, the ailing 73-year-old Arafat has managed to cling to power and remain at the helm of the \"Palestinian Revolution\".\nEven though Arafat may not have been able to achieve his goal of independence for the Palestinians, the Palestinian leader will go down in history as the man who shaped their struggle.", "On May 5, the grounds of the Georgia Industrial Children\u2019s Home looked more like Churchill Downs, thanks to the serendipitous coincidence of the running of the Kentucky Derby on the same day as the sixth annual Dinner in the Orchard, on the front lawn of the children\u2019s home, a fundraiser that this year attracted 260 people.\nPam Groves, chairman of the decorating committee for the event, dubbed this year\u2019s event \u201cBig Hats & Bowties,\u201d a theme that was reflected not only in the dress for the evening, but in the red roses, saddles and other racing memorabilia. The sea of hats was as colorful as the streamers fluttering in the breeze at the edge of the pecan orchard \u2013 and a thoroughbred stood sentinel at either side of the entrance to the gym. One of the men was bold enough to wear a baby blue suit emblazoned with red fruit, finished off with a red bow tie, of course!\nDuring the reception, guests sipped on mint juleps, prepared by Chef Matthew Raifford, who has returned every year with Chef Adam Jones, of Halyard\u2019s Catering in St. Simons, who prepared dinner. With tiny julep cups in hand, guests watched the two-plus minutes race, broadcast from Kentucky on two big-screen televisions, provided by Ken\u2019s Stereo Junction, an in-kind sponsor for the evening. The reception was held on the grounds in front of the gymnasium, with catered hors d\u2019oeuvres, prepared by Goodwill\u2019s Edgar\u2019s Bistro, served inside, against an exact replica of the race provided by Backdrops Fantastic.\nMollie the trolley was on hand to take the revelers back up the hill for dinner after Justify deftly ran the muddy track to handily win the Kentucky Derby. Groves\u2019 decorating committee transformed the tent to a subtly lighted fantasy, with red roses on every table, before Chef Jones wowed the crowd with herbed corn salad, delicate crab cakes, one of this coastal chef\u2019s specialties, and short ribs that melted in the mouth.\nJennifer Shawa, director of development for Twin Cedars, based in Columbus, under whose aegis GICH operates, was in Macon all week overseeing the numerous details involved in staging the ambitious event. Linda Finley, program director for the local facility, was head cheerleader, perking up her staff of volunteers and keeping them nourished as the week unfolded \u2014 and grew warmer. The funds raised by Dinner in the Orchard make projects like the new gymnasium a reality, for the boys and young men who live at GICH.", "The Prime Minister\u2019s security is being beefed up in a big way and several unprecedented measures have either come up already or are in the pipeline, well placed government sources told The Tribune today.\nThe ongoing exercise has acquired special importance in view of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s confirmation that he would be visiting Pakistan to attend the 12th SAARC summit to be held in Islamabad from January 4 to 6.\nSecurity agencies believe that this development has added a whole new dimension to the VVIP security scenario as terrorist outfits like Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad have already gone on record saying that Prime Minister Vajpayee himself was their target and the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen also recently declared its intention of targeting the Prime Minister.\nTo ward off \u201cfidayeen\u201d squads trying to ram into the Prime Minister\u2019s house with a truck bomb or a car bomb, a concrete wall is being constructed on the periphery, separating the house from the main road. The wall would render any such attack ineffective.\nThe sources said the review of the PM\u2019s security was \u201ca continuous process\u201d and there was nothing abrupt about the current review.\nAmong the new security measures for the PM, the most important is perhaps the most controversial as the security managers still do not seem to have made up their minds about it: construction of a helipad at the Prime Minister\u2019s house at Race Course Road.\nThe construction of the proposed helipad has still not begun as there are a lot of pros and cons on the million-dollar question: whether the PM is more safe when he takes the aerial route within the capital or when he takes the land route.\nIt has been several months since Mr Vajpayee has stopped his weekly public \u2018darshans\u2019 in the lawns of the Prime Minister\u2019s house because the security agencies believed that the PM is unduly exposed to a potential sniper rifle or telescopic rifle attack from the nearby high-rise buildings.\nBesides, a bulletproof glasstube passage has already come up at the Prime Minister\u2019s house connecting 3, Race Course Road to Panchvati where Mr Vajpayee meets people and delegations. TDP MP Mr Venugopalachari, who used to live in 1, Race Course Road, has vacated in response to government\u2019s requests and the Special Protection Group (SPG) has taken over this bungalow as well.\nThe SPG\u2019s acquisition of 1, Race Course Road plugs a gaping loophole in the PM\u2019s security as its adjacent bungalow, 3 Race Course Road is the private residential zone for the PM though he operates from 7, Race Course Road.\nWith the SPG taking over 1, Race Course Road, the entire stretch of the road which houses bungalows number 1, 3. 5, 7 and 9 is now under the total control of the PM\u2019s security apparatus.", "As it turns out, Shaftsbury is not eligible for the USDA Community Connect Grants that the Selectboard voted to pursue at our last meeting. We were hoping to pay service providers like Comcast to extend services lines, but a requirement of the grant is that the recipient own the lines. We are not in a position to run the lines ourselves. We are still on track to map internet connectivity and cell phone coverage and to look for other ways to fill in the gaps.\nTown Administrator David Kiernan reported that the Public Works garage and transfer station complex is nearing completion and on track to come in just slightly under budget. The road crew will move in over the spring as they transition from winter to summer operations.\nThe board agreed to purchase a compaction roller for the grader at a cost of $40,000, funded from the equipment reserve. The purchase was recommended by new road foreman Michael Yanotti. It should reduce dust after grading and harden the road surface for better durability.\nThe board heard from a representative of MHG Solar who offered the town a net metering agreement for electricity. The sole requirement from the town is to agree to buy our electricity from them for 25 years. In exchange we get a modest discount of 7% on our electric bill, which amounts to about $1,200/year. The risk, as pointed out by board member Tony Krulikowski, is that photo-voltaic technology would continue to improve and get cheaper in coming years, and our 7% discount would cease to be a discount at all. The board is studying the contract and will decide at our next meeting.\nMichael Cichanowski and Michael Foley were reappointed to the Planning Commission for three-year terms. Many thanks for their continued service. One seat remains open on the PC, as well as one on the Development Review Board. Please contact David Kiernan if you would like to serve.\nThanks to those who showed up at our Cole Hall open house before Monday's meeting. It was especially gratifying to bring together office layout designer David Kiernan, architects Jeff Goldstone and Jack Byer and builder Ed Shewell. The second floor of Cole Hall is now a great space and a source of pride for those involved.\nTim Scoggins is chair of the Shaftsbury Selectboard.", "As a nation we were hard on the late John Sibanda. We were relentless in our criticism and very unforgiving after that howler against Congo Brazzaville.\nWe called him names, even accused him of daylight witchcraft and went as far as attaching the sell-out label to his name.\nWith hindsight we must admit that what Sibanda needed after that grave mistake was a lifting hand and not harsh criticism.\nA sports psychologist would have done the trick but sadly back then our understanding of sport was not what it is now. After his howler against Congo Brazzaville the giant goalie never recovered his confidence.\nYes on the outside he seemed to be getting on with it but deep inside he suffered an emotional scar, a scar that pained him for the rest of his life.\nSibanda was never called up to the national team again and his place as Zimbabwe Saints number one was usurped by the up and coming Muzondiwa Mugadza.\nCollin Nyabadza, a friend who knew Sibanda well, reckons the goalkeeper in his pal died on the day he made the Congo blunder.\n\u201cThat mistake haunted him for the rest of his life, he felt like he had let the whole country down. I don\u2019t think he ever forgave himself for that one,\u201d said Nyabadza. Lovejoy Mugadza, one of Sibanda\u2019s teammates at Zimbabwe Saints, added: \u201cAfter the Congo game something died inside him. He was often a bag of nerves in goals.\n\u201cHe was quite happy to sit on the bench deputising Lazy Muzo. In one match, Gibson Homela selected him versus Highlanders. Lo and behold, he allowed a simple shot from Mecedes \u201cRambo\u201d Sibanda to slip through his grasp\u2026the Congo blunder killed his confidence.\nIt\u2019s a pity that when people talk of John Sibanda today the main theme of those discussions is the Congo howler and not the great goalkeeper that he was.\nMaybe exorcising the ghost of Congo next month and qualifying for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals will take the burden of that 1992 howler off Sibanda\u2019s shoulder, wherever he is.\nIt\u2019s the least he deserves after the way we treated him.", "\u2022 The Regional Office of Education #50 did not have adequate internal controls over compliance with grant agreements.\nThe Regional Office of Education #50 has several federally funded grant programs. Grant monies can only be used for allowable expenditures as outlined in grant agreements.\nDue to late reimbursements, a program lacked cash to pay for expenditures, resulting in a loan from another program. A review of the amounts due between programs showed a $2,153 loan from Mathematics and Science Partnership program to the Mental Health Parent Resource program. Loans are not one of the allowed uses of the Mathematics and Science Partnership program.\nThe auditors recommended that only discretionary funds should be used to make loans between funds. Each transaction should be examined to ensure that grant funds are not loaned to other programs. All bookkeepers and individuals authorizing funding movement should be aware of the prohibition against loaning restricted funds.\nThe Regional Office of Education #50 responded that it has established procedures to assure that loans between funds are only made from discretionary funds. The Regional Office noted that in October, all bookkeepers and program coordinators/directors were familiarized with the rules which prohibit loans from restricted funds.

If you want to know who\u2019s topping the world\u2019s most powerful people list or update yourself on the America or Europe\u2019s top 50 women in tech, then you look at the Forbes Lists pages. But if you want to know what software technologies are being learned, consumed and used most fervently, there\u2019s really no global barometer to give us the top ten.\nIn the absence of an international technology \u2018hot or not\u2019 list, we can perhaps look at what people are spending most time getting themselves educated in.\nAs we have discussed before here on Forbes, Utah-headquartered Pluralsight specializes in technical training content and skills management for businesses. The company\u2019s Pluralsight Role IQ provides a technical skills benchmarking function to help CIOs and CTOs qualify and quantify their teams' IT skills.

The company works from its Beehive State offices to serve online course students (many of whom will typically be working professionals) all over the world.\nA survey released by the company this week shows that the most popular technologies by world region are split. The Angular web app framework course is popular San Francisco, USA; Bangalore, India; and Beijing, China. Equally, the Python software language course is popular in New York City, USA; Boston, USA; and London, UK.\n\"Companies used to adopt technologies based largely on whether or not they could hire the right people. That's no longer an option. Companies can\u2019t hire or fire their way to success anymore. Huge enterprises are being disrupted by smaller startups who are using technology to completely change long-standing business models. To compete, enterprises must act differently by quickly adopting new technologies, many of which are updated more frequently than we\u2019ve ever experienced. CIOs and CTOs in every industry need to know the technologies in the market, analyze their capabilities, decide which ones will take their company where it needs to go, and then continually upskill their teams to match their evolving tech strategy, which, today, is their corporate strategy,\u201d said Aaron Skonnard, co-founder and CEO, Pluralsight.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the bedrock for the vast majority of what users see and experience online and in their mobile devices, powering everything from simple websites to the complex, rich web applications many companies now use as first-line productivity tools.

Huge businesses have built their livelihoods on these stalwarts\u2026 and they continue to play central roles in many business\u2019 back-end code bases,\u201d said Jones.\nIn terms of what comes next, Pluralsight points to technologies including Microsoft Flow and Microsoft PowerApps. Microsoft Flow is a cloud-based service for non-technical line-of-business users to build workflows that automate time-consuming business tasks and processes across applications and services. Microsoft PowerApps is in a similar category in that it features a simple nice drag-and-drop user interface to allow users to construct a mobile app.\nAlong with the widely discussed rise of so-called low-code programming tools, the empowerment of non-programmers to create automations that may be mission-critical to the businesses is certainly a trend to look out for.\nThe software industry is constantly working to reinvent itself so, as technical as some aspects of this story are, it is arguably interesting for all of us to see what technical tools are most popular, what continues to be useful and what new developments are coming to the fore.\nGlobal tech hubs... and what they like most.", "The improved support and assistance is intended to keep partners in the software giant's fold.\nMicrosoft is launching new initiatives intended to make the Windows operating system a more attractive target for software developers.\nThe company on Sunday launched a new support program and detailed a number of ways it is trying to better connect with the thousands of software makers who develop products that complement Microsoft's offerings. Microsoft made the announcement at a worldwide partner conference taking place in Toronto this week.\nPartners, such as independent software vendors, or ISVs, and systems integrators, are a major part of Microsoft's business, but the relationship can be a tricky one to manage.\nBy offering better support and assistance, the company hopes to keep partners in the Microsoft fold. IBM has boosted its investment in partner programs, centered on its WebSphere software. And Linux and other open-source software are increasingly seen as alternatives to Windows and Office.\nAt the center of Microsoft's efforts is a new partner-support program that offers everything from telephone-based assistance to online resources and consulting services. The services are priced according to the level of assistance offered. Microsoft didn't announce exact pricing for the support program.\nMicrosoft also launched an \"Adopt an ISV\" program, in which Microsoft employees are paired with software makers to offer assistance and guidance on how to work with the software giant. Already 800 Microsoft workers, including some senior executives, have signed up to be a buddy.\n\"It's a nice way to just put a face to Microsoft when a lot of ISVs may just be overwhelmed,\" said Mark Young, general manager for ISVs in the company's Developer & Platform Evangelism group.\nMicrosoft is also changing the way it handles developers that want to sell their software bundled with Microsoft products. The company previously had two programs to handle this: One, known as the royalty program, saw ISVs getting software through Microsoft; the other, known as the product integration program, allowed software makers to buy software through a third-party distributor and then resell Microsoft products as part of their own software.\nThe company is expanding the number of products that can be part of the program to include most server and desktop programs, with Office and Windows as notable exceptions. Also, under the old direct program, ISVs needed to pledge $50,000 in business to Microsoft, but that threshold has been reduced to $10,000 over two years. However, under the revamped program, desktop software will be licensed for use only in conjunction with the ISV's software. In other words, someone who buys a product that comes bundled with, say, Microsoft Access will be able to use it only in conjunction with the ISV's application and not for general use.\n\"We certainly feel by lowering the commitment we should be able to double the number of ISVs in the program,\" Young said.\nThe software giant will also start allowing ISVs to gain access to the error reports received by Microsoft that are related to ISVs' programs. The company has been gradually expanding the number of people who have access to the information Microsoft gets when a program crashes, reports generated via a tool known as Watson.\nThe company is also announcing a specialized version of its MSDN developer site for ISVs, as well as an expanded tour of road shows and quarterly online classes to keep in closer touch.", "(Updated at 3:05 p.m.) Emotions escalated at yesterday\u2019s County Board meeting when the topic turned to issuing a live entertainment permit for Pines of Italy (3111 Columbia Pike).\nCounty staff researching the permit request had recommended the issue be deferred until the board\u2019s September 15 meeting. That recommendation \u2014 which was approved by a unanimous vote of the Board \u2014 is supposed to give the owner time to convince the community there would not be violence or disruptive incidents like those that previously occurred on the property. Police and neighbors have expressed opposition to approving the permit.\nSeven residents who live nearby showed up at the meeting to enumerate the reasons they oppose the permit. In addition to the noise, loitering and public drunkenness that all reported witnessing, a major concern is safety. Nearly all of the speakers had reported calling the police after witnessing brutal fights between club goers, some of which spill into the neighborhood.\nIt was noted that the establishment is at the end of a residential street and has a significant impact on people\u2019s lives.\nLike other speakers, Pasion stated she didn\u2019t mind the restaurant or hookah bar inside the building, but a club is too disruptive and dangerous.\nPart of the controversy is the involvement of Jorge Escobar, who is currently named as the landlord. He has been involved with the property in various capacities for more than a decade, sometimes as a manager of the club.\nEscobar\u2019s attorney testified at the meeting and promised the board that the three partners of this establishment are interested in starting anew. He expressed Escobar\u2019s interest in working with people living in the neighborhood. However, residents claim attempts to work with him before have been unfruitful.\nQuestions were raised over whether Escobar\u2019s involvement would perpetuate some of the previous issues. It was noted that he previously held an entertainment permit for a night club on the property, but it was revoked in 2002 due to police and fire code issues.\nSeveral board members said they were confused about the establishment and how it\u2019s divided into a restaurant, hookah bar and nightclub. Repeatedly, clarification was requested on how each of the three partners is involved in the business, and why the Pines of Italy restaurant was listed as the permit holder instead of the night club.\nEscobar\u2019s attorney said each partner has a responsibility for one of the operations. He said Escobar had looked to hire someone to take care of the entertainment portion. He also said the night club is essential for the establishment to make enough money to stay open, and the partners would do what is necessary to appease the community.\nResidents report not experiencing major disturbances since December, when the previous night club shut down. However, there\u2019s doubt about whether new managers would be able to adequately control a club in a location with such a history of trouble. Board Member Chris Zimmerman echoed the sentiment, saying the proximity of this commercial building to a residential area is one of the closest the board has encountered.\nZimmerman added that Escobar\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t present enough of a convincing case that efforts would be made to change, or that partners had worked to resolve issues with neighbors.\nBefore voting on the issue, Board Member Jay Fisette summed up the reasoning for deferring \u2014 lack of confidence that the same problems previously plaguing the property wouldn\u2019t resurface.", "However, the bill's passage came after a debate over where that money should go, with some councilmembers calling for the money to be directed towards programs for people experiencing homelessness in the District.\nWASHINGTON -- On Tuesday, the D.C. City Council passed a bill that allowed the District to collect internet sales tax that meets certain requirements.\nThat money was subsequently designated to lower the commercial property tax rate from $1.89 per hundred back down to $1.85 per hundred.\nHowever, the bill\u2019s passage came after a debate over where that money should go, with some councilmembers calling for the money to be directed towards programs for people experiencing homelessness in the District.\nOn Tuesday, Councilmember Jack Evans, who chairs the Metro board, explained that in 2014, when the idea of internet sale tax first came up for discussion, the Council decided it would be used for Metro.\nEvans said that gave them about $32 million.\nHe used this as justification for calling for the internet sales tax revenue to go towards lowering the property tax.\nHowever, on Tuesday, Councilmember Nadeau offered an amendment to that bill that would take recurring internet sales tax in 2020 and put it towards lowering commercial sales tax 1 cent per hundred, while allocatting the remaining money towards housing programs and programs that benefit those experiencing homelessness.\n\u201cHas the issue of issue of homelessness and housing instability in the District over the past five years lessened so much so that we no longer see them as priorities?\u201d she asked her colleagues.\nGrosso, Silverman, Allen and Cheh also introduced the amendment.\nSilverman, agreeing with the amendment, said, \u201cMy staff has looked in the public record everywhere and we cannot find any agreement by this body to undo the property tax increase.\" She also said that in 2013, it was agreed that any sales tax would be split 50/50 between homelessness programs and WMATA.\nHowever, both Chairman Mendelson and Councilmember Evans dissented.\n\u201cOur commercial property tax is the highest in the region,\u201d Mendelson replied, explaining his support behind the underlying bill.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard that commercial property tax is the highest in the region. You know what else is? Homelessness,\u201d Nadeau countered.\nAt the vote, Nadeau\u2019s amendment failed 6-6, with McDuffie absent, with the underlying bill passing 8-4.", "A startup says a 50-trillion-pixel image of Earth, refreshed daily, is coming later this year.\nLast week, Google pushed one of the most interesting sectors in Silicon Valley toward maturity\u2014and brought a milestone in cartography closer to reality. It accomplished all that, paradoxically, by getting out of the market.\nFrom a business standpoint, here\u2019s the news: Google sold its in-house satellite business, known as Terra Bella, to Planet, Inc. Planet is a startup based in San Francisco that already operates a fleet of 60 orbiting cameras the size of shoeboxes. With the acquisition, Planet is now the de facto leader in the small-satellite space, and it will add Terra Bella\u2019s seven high-resolution satellites to its own constellation of medium-resolution craft.\nAs part of the deal, Planet will give Google access to its growing archive of imagery for at least the next few years.\nBut the more interesting development has less to do with acquisitions and more with technological capacity. Planet also announced that it will deploy 88 small satellites later this month, as part of a rocket launch from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in southeastern India on February 14. Assuming that most of the spacecraft make it to orbit intact, these satellites should become fully operational by the summer.\nWhen that happens, Planet will be the first to hit a long-discussed milestone in the industry: It will photograph every place on the entire planet every day. Every park, every rice paddy, every patch of pine and permafrost: all will be imaged anew, daily, at medium resolution.\nPlanet says that the India launch will break the record for most satellites deployed on a single rocket. Launches remain one of the most costly aspects of the space business, and the company has gotten burned for its frugality before. Its leaders know, from firsthand experience, that not its satellites all will survive the journey to space. In October 2014, Planet became the first company ever to lose 26 satellites at once when an Antares rocket exploded on the tarmac. Nine months later, it lost another eight spacecraft when a SpaceX rocket failed before it left the atmosphere.\nBut if even a minority of the satellites make it into orbit, Planet will operate the largest private satellite constellation ever built. The Iridium Communications constellation, which encompasses 72 satellites, holds that title now (though Iridium\u2019s satellites are more expensive than Planet\u2019s and they orbit farther from Earth).\nThis constellation will have two components. A standard Planet satellite, which it calls a \u201cdove,\u201d is cheaply made. It is essentially an extra-large Cubesat, a widely used standard for building small spacecraft. It captures pixels that are three meters to a side. Each of the seven Terra Bella satellites, on the other hand, is about the size of a dorm-room fridge. A Terra Bella satellite detects pixels that are 90 centimeters to a side under good conditions.\n\u201cYou can use the medium-resolution constellation to scan the planet every day, and then\u2014say you see a plane crash or a flood in a town\u2014you can use the high-resolution satellites to snap those changes,\u201d says Will Marshall, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Planet.\nThe sale and acquisition caps off half a decade of growth and turmoil in the sector. When I first wrote about the small-satellite industry three years ago, it seemed a rare locus of hardware innovation in a software- and services-obsessed technology industry. Earth-observing satellites require, at minimum, high-quality image sensors and reliable radio antennas. The smartphone boom had transformed both: Thanks to economies of scale and foreign electronics manufacturing, the bare technological components of a satellite had become both cheap and nearly industrial-grade.\nTaken together, this allowed companies to build much cheaper satellites. Unlike legacy players in the business, which build a single satellite worth tens of millions of dollars over the course of years, a startup could build lots of small satellites fast and hurl them into orbit. Losing a satellite during launch, which was once cause to ready a company\u2019s obituary (or at least its legal team), would now become a point of pride. \u201cIf you never lose a satellite, you\u2019re not pushing the envelope,\u201d Marshall told me at the time.\nThe two frontrunners in the industry were firms called Skybox Imaging and Planet Labs. Skybox planned to build a small fleet of medium-sized satellites that could capture high-definition video of Earth. Planet Labs, on the other hand, wanted to flood the lowest reaches of orbit with shoebox-sized cubesats.\nYou might be able to figure out where this is going. In June 2014, Google purchased Skybox for $500 million. It relocated the company closer to its campus, then rechristened it Terra Bella in March 2016. Meanwhile, Planet Labs bought the German satellite company BlackBridge. It kept sending rounds of new Cubesats into the sky. Eventually, it dropped the \u201cLabs\u201d from its name.\nPlanet and Terra Bella\u2014the two firms that, under different names, defined the industry three years ago\u2014are now one organization. Planet is now the obvious front runner, and the sector is its to define.\nPlanet medium-resolution \u201cdoves\u201d captured this image of autumn color in New Hampshire in October 2016.\nA high-resolution Terra Bella satellite took this image of Istanbul in September 2016.\nNot that the game is over. DigitalGlobe, a $700-million public company that provides much of the base imagery for the U.S. government and Google Maps, remains the juggernaut in the remote-sensing space. Its newest WorldView satellites have nine-times the resolution of the best Terra Bella craft. They are also the size of small trucks. Last year, the company signed a deal with the technology accelerator for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to build a private constellation of Earth-observing small satellites. It\u2019s possible to imagine a future where DigitalGlobe takes its own small-satellite, medium-resolution image of Earth everyday\u2014except that it will be augmented by the military-grade imagery of the WorldView constellation.\nThere are smaller competitors as well. BlackSky\u2014which, in an industry built by spooks, somehow still has far and away the spookiest name\u2014released the first images from its first satellite in November. It says 59 more satellites will follow by the close of the decade. Another startup, Spire, offers global weather forecasts through an orbiting Cubesat network. And no matter who \u201cwins\u201d in the space, other companies will clamor around the victors. Orbital Insight and Descartes Labs are two startups that sell computer-generated reports based on Planet\u2019s satellite imagery. Their chief customers are financial firms, insurance companies, and farmers.\nA complete image of Earth\u2019s surface, updated daily\u2014this has long been the promise of the small-satellite industry. When it\u2019s finally achieved, it will be critical that it help not only Goldman Sachs and Monsanto, but also humanitarians, climate scientists, and land-rights groups. But it will also be crucial that people appreciate all the exquisite specificity of the image.", "Talk.Global, M&C Saatchi Group's lifestyle and consumer boutique agency, has appointed Sophie Haye as board director, completing its leadership team.\nHayes has previously worked at Splendid and Freuds.\nHayes brings more than 15 years of experience and heads Talk.Global's global division, working across many of the agency\u2019s flagship clients, including Pernod Ricard, Pandora, Coty and Adidas by Stella McCartney.\nShe fills the void previously held by Shilpa Saul on an interim basis.

Relegated to the back of men\u2019s closets everywhere, it waited to be pulled out for festive occasions. Then two years ago, $850 Saint Laurent versions of the Hawaiian shirt strolled down the Parisian runways in a blaze of brightly colour palm fronds.\nWhich brings us to the summer of 2016, and the Hawaiian shirt trend has hit the mainstream. It has turned into a much bigger trend now at mass market than it ever was at the rarefied designer level.\nThere is a movie tie-in. This spring\u2019s release of A Bigger Splash, starring Tilda Swinton and Ralph Fiennes, features a Hawaiian-style shirt by Christophe Lemaire (a one-off made for the film, though a similar shape found on his website lemaire.fr retails for 435 euros). Overall the film\u2019s wardrobe is \u201940s retro, but The New York Times called out that single item out as a major fashion moment. Fiennes wears the shirt for a Risky Business-type dance around the house scene, left suggestively open to show off his pecs. Talk about adding heat to a trend.\nThe retro feel of the shirt is authentic: the style dates back to the 1930s in Honolulu where they were originally produced in kimono fabric by Japanese craftspeople. By the end of the war, servicemen had brought the jaunty, exotic look back to the mainland. Flowers out of their natural habitat, the screaming tropical prints (think Elvis Presley in Blue Hawaii) came to signify good times. It had a moment in the \u201980s (think Magnum PI) and it makes a comeback among frat boys every couple of years.\n\u201cThis is a generation that does not tuck in,\u201d Shannon Stewart, the assistant general merchandise manager at Harry Rosen, says of the younger demographic market. So the Hawaiian shirt, in its \u201cleaner, fitter, trimmer,\u201d form, she says, is a much bigger hit in mainstream for the shop than it was when it arrived in designer in 2014.\nStewart adds the chain has seen \u201cstrong sales\u201d in short-sleeve options in general. \u201cAnd novelty prints are big. They add an element of wit, and uniqueness to an outfit. Fun without being over the top.\u201d Good Hawaiian styles can be found from labels such as Robert Graham, Diesel and Bugatchi in the $150 to $250 range.\nAt GotStyle, options range from $70 for Selected brand shirts, through $149 from Reyn Spooner (the traditional Hawaiian label) and $225 for versions from Haspel, the men\u2019s clothier better known for its seersucker suiting, dating back to 1909.\nAustria suggests that the shirts work with the new, slimmer shorts on the market. \u201cBoard shorts and baggy cargos are out. The look is flat front, to just above the knee.\u201d They can also work for office casual. \u201cYou could wear this shirt under a casual blazer, with an \u201cair tie\u201d look,\u201d meaning the buttons done all the way up to the top, sans tie.\nAnd one of those bizarre trend loops that happen when your dad is accidentally hip again.", "Will Obama Give Israel even more American Weapons and Dollars to Kill Palestinians?\nPresident Obama met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on November 9 in the White House and is considering the Israeli request to give a 50% increase of nearly $1.5 billion in U.S. military funding, bringing the U.S. donation to the killing of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to $4.5 billion a year.\nAs it stands now, more that half of the U.S. foreign military spending for 2016 goes to Israel. As in all things, Israel gets special treatment by the U.S., allowing Israel to spend 25% of its gift from the U.S. to pay itself for buying weapons from its own weapons industry!!!\nAccording to a recent congressional report, Israel has received $124.3 billion in military assistance from the US since its founding in 1948.\nThe report states that \"strong congressional support for Israel has resulted in Israel receiving benefits not available to any other countries; for example, Israel can use U.S. military assistance both for research and development in the United States and for military purchases from Israeli manufacturers.\n\"In addition, U.S. assistance earmarked for Israel is generally delivered in the first 30 days of the fiscal year, while most other recipients normally receive aid in installments, and Israel (as is also the case with Egypt) is permitted to use cash flow financing for its U.S. arms purchases.\n\"In addition to receiving U.S. State Department-administered foreign assistance, Israel also receives funds from annual defense appropriations bills for rocket and missile defense programs. Israel pursues some of those programs jointly with the United States.\"\nAs Obama was meeting Netanyahu, eight blocks away at the Palestine Center in Washington, DC, a surgeon from Norway who works on behalf of his university part of each year in al Shifa hospital in Gaza, told of the devastation, destruction and human suffering these American weapons and dollars cause.\nDr. Mads Gilbert spoke of 51 days of terror in Gaza in the summer of 2014 as the Israeli Attack forces brutalized the people of Gaza with Israeli and U.S. artillery, assassin drone ordnance, F16s, hellfire missiles and dense inert military explosives. Gilbert said that the 2014 Israeli attack on Gaza was 500% stronger than 2009 attack. He was working at al Shifa hospital in 2009 when the IDF attacked Gaza. In 2014, the IDF fired 50,000 of those shells into Gaza and conducted over 6,000 air strikes, destroying over 3,500 buildings in Gaza City alone including over 50% of the hospitals in Gaza.\nAt the end of the 51-day attack, 2,250 Palestinians were dead, including 551 children and 299 women -- 3,500 Palestinian children were wounded and the 1 million children and youth who live in Gaza were all deeply affected by the attacks. Of the 1.8 million who live in Gaza, 60 percent are under the age of 22.\nDr. Gilbert's presentation included mind-searing photos of the carnage caused by Israeli attacks and the audio of the sounds of jets racing overhead, bombs exploding and buildings collapsing.\nCiting the report of the United Nations Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict, Gilbert said the IDF purposefully targeted the civilian population including entire families, as well as targeting hospitals, ambulances and four UN shelter facilities.\nThe report stated that \"Hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed in their own homes, especially women and children. At least 142 families lost three or more members in an attack on a residential building during the summer of 2014, resulting in 742 deaths. The fact that Israel did not revise its practice of air-strikes, even after their dire effects on civilians became apparent, raises the question of whether this was part of a broader policy which was at least tacitly approved at the highest level of government.\"\nAdditionally, \"the commission is concerned about Israel's extensive use of weapons with a wide kill and injury radius; though not illegal, their use in densely populated areas is highly likely to kill combatants and civilians indiscriminately. There appears also to be a pattern whereby the IDF issued warnings to people to leave a neighbourhood and then automatically considered anyone remaining to be a fighter. This practice makes attacks on civilians highly likely. During the Israeli ground incursion into Gaza that began in mid-July 2014, hundreds of people were killed and thousands of homes destroyed or damaged.\nThe commission report stated: \"Palestinian armed groups fired 4,881 rockets and 1,753 mortars towards Israel in July and August 2014, killing 6 civilians, including one child and injuring at least 1,600.\" 66 Israeli soldiers were killed in military operations inside Gaza.\"", "Queens is one of the five boroughs of New York, located just across the East River from Manhattan.

A. Heaps Building, the 1910 building on the corner of Portage Avenue and Garry Street, is undergoing repairs to stabilize the terra cotta cornice by using new materials to mimic the past. The renovations to the one-time Bank of Nova Scotia started earlier this year. Three months ago, workers fixed the southeast ceiling corner in the huge banking hall, where water came in through cracks in the cornice running along the building's upper exterior wall.\n\"This is one of the really grand interiors of Winnipeg,\" says Wins Bridgman, whose firm, Bridgman Collaborative Architecture, helped with the work that seamlessly replaced old plaster with new.\nGesturing at the ornate ceiling trying to point out the repaired section, he says, \"The work we did was meant to be invisible.\"\nOutside on the scaffolding above Garry Street, towards the back of the building, Bridgman shows the causes of the interior water damage. Two sections of the terra cotta cornice have been removed to reveal the decaying structure holding them in place. The damage started years ago with steel outriggers extending from the building's main structure expanding and contracting in summer and winter. When that made small cracks, water got in to exacerbate the freezing and thawing effects. Bolted under the outriggers, a horizontal I-beam of steel, meant to support the cornice pieces, shows a brown edge flaky with rust.\nWithin the spaces of the hollow terra cotta pieces, expanding spray foam shows evidence of a 35-year-old cornice repair job that never took. \"It was well intentioned,\" says Stan Rhoda, provincial manager of architecture, \"but not well executed or well planned.\" The original repair, says Rhoda, used, \"open-cell foam that acted like a sponge. It caused some of the problems we're seeing now.\"\nThe current work includes new horizontal steel beams, this time stainless and secured above the original outriggers, to stabilize the cornice and help prevent similar damage elsewhere. Copper flashing over the new steel promises to make the cornice watertight.\nWhen the Bank of Nova Scotia established this location in 1910, other banks along Main Street's \"Bankers Row\" already administered most of the commerce on Winnipeg's old business district. But the Portage Avenue location gave the Bank of Nova Scotia a chance to gain business from the newer bustle rising on Portage Avenue as the city boomed.\n\"This stabilization project is really about stabilizing cultural memory,\" says Bridgman, talking about the building's original terra cotta. Available from catalogues, countless styles of pre-fabricated glazed terra cotta pieces gave local builders at the turn of the last century a cheap and impressive option. Coming in slightly varying colours, the pieces looked like stone buildings of old, without the expense of stone cutting.\nNow, Alfred Widmer, working with Alpha Masonry, will use glass-fibre-reinforced concrete to mould replacement cornice pieces as needed. Cement mortar mixed with tiny strands of glass give GFRC more ability to change with the temperature before cracking. Glazing will help vary the colour of new pieces to match the old. \"None of these are the same colour,\" says Widmer, pointing at the terra cotta slabs on the wall below the cornice. \"They're all different shades of beige.\"\n\"Terra cotta was a fanciful material,\" says Bridgman, claiming special admiration for the original terra cotta work on the Heaps Building. \"Outlandish and marvellous \u0097 you could make anything out of terra cotta,\" says Bridgman. \"It represents early Winnipeg ideas, aspirations and enthusiasm. We were going out of our way to show we were a real place.\"\nThe Heaps Building restoration comes in three parts \u0097 the cornice stabilization this year, repairs to the dome next year, and fa\u00e7ade cleaning in 2009 to make the place look 99 years young.", "The following contains minor spoilers for Us.\nJordan Peele has been compared by many to Alfred Hitchcock for the way has manages suspense in his films.

Joe Russo has also appeared in his Marvel movies from time to time.\nHowever, I can't think of a time a director has made a point to appear in two films, but in a way that he would almost certainly never be recognized. It wasn't until somebody asked him about the idea of appearing in his own films that we learned that he actually had.\nCheck out the interview with Fandango below to hear exactly what Jordan Peele sounds like in his cameos.\nWe don't know what's next for Jordan Peele when it comes to the director's chair. He's working as a producer of an upcoming remake of Candyman as well as the newest iteration of The Twilight Zone so he may not be directing another movie soon. If and when Peele makes another feature film, I suppose we should all look for a scene in which an animal dies, at that appears to be the place we'll hear Jordan Peele cameo in the future.", "International Travel News has been an invaluable trip-planning aid for travelers since 1976.

Or your slide guitar from your rhythm guitar? Then look no further than Wille and The Bandits.\nFrom deepest darkest Cornwall, this marauding band of likely lads - Wille Edwards (vocals/guitar), Matthew Brooks (bass) and Andy Nauman (drums/percussion) - will provide you with the very best education in genre-defying music, featuring instruments rarely seen in western music, and almost never in the blues/rock scene.\nWille, leader of this band of merry men, explained: \"Basically we are a roots/rock band. We mix a lot of different genres, but predominately we are called a rock band. We use a lot of world music, and blues and sort of Latin. We use a lot of percussion and slide guitars. Like when we are playing live we have various forms of percussion, and I play a guitar on my lap with a steel bar on a slide guitar. It's quite an unusual sound. And it's quite unique but people seem to love it.\"\nBut these guys take it even further - sometimes they can be seen at points playing instruments simultaneously.\nWill said: \"Sometimes I will be playing slide guitar with a lap steel and then be playing a normal electric guitar behind it, and I'm almost playing two guitars simultaneously.\n\"Matt's the same with the bass. He's plays a lot of double bass with a bow, like the classical way of playing, like a cello and he'll play bass as well. Matt also plays the keyboards on his feet as well.\n\"And then Andy's mixing, playing a drum kit, and he mixes in percussion. So he sort of plays percussion with what he's doing live as well.\n\"It's very much a live thing, you know. When you hear a record, it's easy, because you think they've done all that in the studio, you can just layer up instrument over instrument, but when you do it live, we sort of manage to try and get that sound live with three people and it generally means some of us doing two jobs at once.\"\nAnd how did Wille meet up with his fellow Bandits? \"Like all rock bands - in the pub!\" he laughs.\n\"I was introduced to Andy through a mutual friend and I dragged him up with us that night - we didn't even have a jam. He just brought his djembe along. Cos he's got like millions of djembe and bits of percussion. And he started jamming with me on stage.\n\"Then I used to invite people up to play with me. And basically that's how Wille and The Bandits came along really, it was just whoever came along to play.\n\"But it has been mainly me and Andy from the beginning. Then we were introduced to Matt, who is actually Andy's landlord. He is a phenomenal bass player, like one of the best bass players you are likely to see. And we persuaded him to join the band and it has just gone from strength to strength really. It's fantastic.\"\nWille and The Bandits don't just rely on their unusual sound to create waves in the music scene, the use of eclectic influences in song writing also delve deep. Some of the songs lead you on a journey of self-realisation, others paint a picture that unashamedly draws on global issues such as climate change and immigration.\n\"We are definitely quite socially conscious, the way we write. You know, we're not like a straight up rock band in that respect. There's a lot of social commentary in our songs, and we try and talk about bigger issues, global issues.\n\"I wouldn't say we were a sort of politically active band or a protest band but we do have quite a lot of that in our music because we feel quite strongly about it.\n\"No way are we a band that just writes about falling in love every song, you know. It's about trying to make a difference with our lyrics, and trying to make a change. You know hopefully people will read into them and understand what we are saying, or if they don't, start to look at the other side,\" he said.\nIt's not just Wille who comes up with the song-writing ideas either.\nHe added: \"We write together. Someone comes up with an idea and we bring it to the band and we jam through it. Some of them come from percussion ideas and bass ideas as well.\n\"We just love writing and playing new stuff. We've got plenty of that on the road at the moment as well. We've been playing a lot of new stuff. We're just really, really looking forward to it.\"\nThis unusual sound and interesting mix of lyrics has brought them some impressive critical acclaim, with The Daily Telegraph describing them as \"one of the countries best live acts\" and being voted in the top ten must see bands at Glastonbury 2014 by BBC Radio 1. But they haven't let this go to their heads.\nWille said: \"We're really pleased actually.\n\"We are lucky enough we're up for another award now for, I think, innovation and the blues, which is quite good because it's always been what we've been like. A lot of people say we play blues, because we've got slide guitar and I've got a gruff voice, but we're not really a blues band.\n\"We are very different as well, so it's nice for people to really sort of notice the innovation we put into it. Because we are trying to do something different and trying to move it forward into the modern sort of realms.\n\"It has been nice to be nominated for that accolade and hopefully many more will come. But we don't play music for accolades really.\n\"It's nice to be appreciated, but the main thing, you do it because you love it and you feel like that's what you wanna do. And I don't think awards or strong press would change what we do. I think we know what we like doing and what we enjoy doing and that's the main thing.\"\nThis latest tour sees them play a lot of smaller venues, but the size of the venue makes little difference for Wille and The Bandits. He explained: \"It's difficult really. It's all about the people. You can play a massive hall but if the people aren't vibing with you, you know, it's not as enjoyable.\n\"It's always about the audience really, rather than size. And if they are with you, it's such a good feeling, you know, you really, really enjoy it. I mean most of the time we generally have that and people enjoy our shows.\n\"But yeah, it's more the quality of people, rather than the quantity of people.\"\nSo where do the band see themselves in five years time?\n\"Wow. Five years. It's funny actually, because you look back five years and think we have come on quite a way.\n\"I mean I hope we are still touring. I hope we are doing bigger venues and we're also touring different places and visiting different countries. And just still living the dream really.\n\"You know, in 10 years, I hope we're still going, which I'm sure we will be, and making more exciting records, meeting new people and travelling the world. Then happy days!\" he chuckles.\nWille and the Bandits will be playing at Preston's Continental pub and they will have a couple of tricks up their sleeve for the tour. \"You can expect a few new songs. We're writing a few new tracks for the new studio album. We've also got a brand new live album which is coming out, which will be available at the Conti.\n\"It's a double-disc live album, which will be available at the show. People in Preston will have the first opportunity to get their hands on it.\n\"We're trying to capture what we do live on record and I think we got sort of quite close to that. We're all pretty pleased with that.\"\nAnd Preston feels like a sort of home from home for Wille: \"It's a nice feeling up there in Preston. The people are really friendly and nice. It reminds me a lot of down in Cornwall.\n\"It's always a good night up there. It's always packed and everyone has a good time. We really enjoy it.\"\nCatch Wille and The Bandits on Friday, February 23 at The Continental on South Meadow Lane, Preston. Doors open at 8pm and admission is \u00a312 advance or \u00a314 on the door. Support on the night comes from Blackballed.", "Dave Murray | Grand Rapids PressFormer U.S. Assistant Education Secretary Diane Ravitch appeared Monday at an MEA symposium on school reform.\nNOVI \u2013 The United States is \u201cin an age national stupidity,\u201d with a corporate education reform agenda bent on \u201cdemonizing teachers so it can fire them,\u201d national education advocate Diane Ravitch said at a union-backed education reform symposium.\nRavich, a former assistant U.S. secretary of education who had a role in developing No Child Left Behind and the charter school movement, renounced both reforms, saying they've given way to a culture of incentives and punishments through testing that does little to help students.\nWe recently wrote a column for CNN.com that garnered national attention for saying there was a \"simmering rage\" among teachers who feel they've been under attack and made a scapegoat for school and budget problems.\nSpeaking at a Michigan Education Association school reform symposium that drew educators from across the state, Ravitch said the country can't improve schools by constantly cutting budgets and using standardized tests to paint teachers as ineffective in an attempt to \u201cde-professionalize\u201d the work.\nRavitch said the reform talk comes as schools are cutting budgets by eliminating pre-kindergarten classes, laying off teachers, trimming arts and physical education and boosting class sizes.\n\u201cThe problem is poverty, not bad teachers,\u201d she said.\nRavitch had barbs for both the political left and right, saying both sides have allowed corporate interests to control the education agenda.\nThe bipartisan education reform signed in 2002 calls for, among other things, schools to show constant improvement on standardized tests or face a progressive series of sanctions.\nRavitch said the reliance on test scores is a mistake, saying that while there is \u201csome value\u201d at looking at trends in scores, the tests tend to be poorly written and scored with results tweaked for political reasons.\nRavitch said President Obama's Race to the Top reforms promise to be ineffective, noting that the program pitted states against each other for millions of dollars in competitive grants \u2013 that some states have claimed don't cover the costs of setting the changes in place.\n\u201cI think you were lucky enough not to win it,\u201d she said of Michigan's failed application.\nRavitch called the Race plans an apparent attempt to federalize education through a series of untried programs written by leaders of the Gates and Broad foundations, which are organizations that spend millions supporting school reform efforts.\nShe questioned why Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, is considered an educational expert and questioned his recent plan to replace rewarding teachers for advanced degrees and seniority, with instead paying better teachers more and giving them larger classes.\nRavitch said making all teachers at-will employees would ensure that the ones with the most experience \u2013 the most expensive because of seniority \u2013 would be the first to be laid off when money is tight.\nShe said the testing environment has forced good teachers to narrow their curriculum to tested subjects and overly focus on the exams.\nAfter the address, Ravitch said schools reforms should center around early childhood so students can start their educational career ready to learn and focusing on treating problems associated with poverty, including working with health and social service agencies.\nShe also spoke about her recent appearance on Comedy Central's \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d which addresses serious topics while poking fun at newsmakers and the media.\n\u201cJon Stewart single-handedly may have done more to turn the tide of public opinion,\u201d she said, noting that the comedian's mother is a teacher. \"People should say 'thank you' and stop knocking teachers,\"", "Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) will be completing its acquisition of a 75 per cent stake in Han Language Centre today, laying the ground for its Chinese Media Group (CMG) to co-develop educational programmes and events for students and adults with the language centre.\nWith the completion of this acquisition, plans for which were announced in August, SPH will have direct oversight of operations at Han Language Centre, which was founded in 1993 and now has close to 3,000 students enrolled in 18 education centres islandwide.\nOn top of tuition classes for primary and secondary students, it also co-organises events with Lianhe Zaobao's Student Publications to cultivate children's interest in Chinese language and culture.\nThe centre's founder and principal Ann Jong Juan, who is a Cultural Medallion recipient, will hold the remaining stake.\nWhile Han Language Centre has been largely perceived by the public as a tuition centre over the last two decades or so, it is more than that, said Mr Ann.\n\"(People believed that) you came here only if your Mandarin was weak. But we want to slowly change that perception, and be seen as a centre for learning and deepening one's interest in the Chinese language,\" he added.\nEducation materials at Han Language Centre are developed based on the latest Ministry of Education (MOE) syllabus.\nStaff strength at the centre has been beefed up to 108 after the acquisition, with 10 new hires in the centre's management team comprising educators who have had prior experience in developing and teaching the MOE curriculum.\nA new advisory board has also been assembled. It includes a representative from the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and Dr Foo Suan Fong, executive director of the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language.\nCMG head Lee Huay Leng said that they are exploring the possibility of providing adult education classes and customised training programmes for corporations in consultation with partners like the SBF in the years ahead, given CMG's intimate knowledge of developments in China and connections with organisations there.\nThese bite-sized courses can help working professionals become more familiarised with political developments and the business environment of modern China, or help companies that are looking to expand to China get a sense of how media relations work there.\nSaid Ms Lee: \"In this rapidly changing economy, we can tap resources and expertise that CMG has accumulated over the years to provide some foundational understanding of China for professionals. Rather than rapid expansion, we want to focus on maintaining and uplifting the quality of programmes that we offer.\"", "New York venture capitalist Fred Wilson recently pointed out that the VC industry is at risk of being marginalized by the emerging crowdfunding industry. I agree that the provision of capital for entrepreneurs is about to change in a big way, but my sense is that the change is not going to hurt VCs.\nVenture capital has always been geographically concentrated, resulting in the emergence of a few hubs of VC and entrepreneurial activity and support services \u2014 Silicon Valley being the best example.\nBut the majority of US entrepreneurs have not been able to benefit from the venture capital industry because they live in the wrong parts of the US. This wasn\u2019t an issue in the early days, when VC was novel. But over time, this geographic concentration has become a limitation.\nLet\u2019s put some numbers to this: In 2010 (the most recent full year the National Venture Capital Association provides numbers for), the VC industry invested $3,945 per person living in the Silicon Valley area compared to $43 per person in the rest of the US, including the other VC hubs like Boston and New York. That\u2019s a 91:1 ratio.\nGo to Michigan and the amount is $15 per person per year. Now we\u2019re talking 263:1. If I was a gambling man, I wouldn\u2019t bet on a startup in Detroit getting venture funding. Better to relocate the family to a VC hub. Or find another option.\nMillions of talented entrepreneurs live in the \u201cwrong parts\u201d of the US, where they have very little chance of getting venture capital. A few hundred (or thousand) of them just might have the spark to cause inspired innovation and bring employment to thousands, perhaps millions.\nThe argument has been that entrepreneurs also need expert advice and resources to excel and that it must all be local. I agree that mentoring, support, and resources in addition to capital are vital. I just don\u2019t buy the local part. What portion of the communication between a VC and his or her portfolio companies was done in person 50 years ago? And what portion of the same communication is now delivered through the Internet? Email, video conference calls, remote screen sharing, group document editing, and other technologies have all changed the way we collaborate.\nThe truth is that a mentor can add a lot of value in assisting an entrepreneur anywhere in the US, or worldwide for that matter.\nThe Internet has shown itself to be very good at providing the platform on which formerly local services can be provided virtually anywhere. eBay did this with auctions, Amazon with books, and Facebook with friendship.\nThe US VC industry ranges from $20 to $30 billion of invested capital per annum, according to the NVCA, and it\u2019s concentrated where most entrepreneurs are not. Imagine if we take the $43 per person of VC invested per year outside Silicon Valley and double it to $86 by bringing the capital and mentoring and resources to entrepreneurs across the US. If that were done, the amount of new capital deployed would be $13 billion per year.\nThat amount of money can fund an additional 6,500 startups per year at the $2 million level.\nCrowdfunding can be an $8 billion to $100 billion industry in six years. This will not come at the expense of the current VC industry; it will complement and extend its reach.\nThis is market expansion, and it will redefine venture capital to break out of its historic limitations.

Fifteen years ago, Mr. Moskowitz was driving a taxi in New York and seldom sold a painting.\nBut now, in another change of luck, the 55-year-old painter earns a comfortable income selling his canvases and has become one of those rare living artists to have his work featured in a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art.\n''It's both difficult and educational to see your life in front of you like this,'' Mr. Moskowitz said of the exhibition of 83 paintings, drawings and collages that traces his career from the late 1950's to the present. His works are characterized by playful, dreamlike images that tread a fine line between abstraction and representation. The show, which can be seen through May 1, was organized by Ned Rifkin of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, and was exhibited there and at La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art in California last year.\nMr. Moskowitz lives and works in a 5,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa with his wife, Hermine Ford, also a painter, and their 23-year-old son, Erik, a painting student at the School of Visual Arts. The other day in his studio, he reflected on the twists and turns in his career.\nBy the time he had turned 40, Mr. Moskowitz's influences included Abstract Expressionist artists like Adolph Gottlieb, his teacher at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, and his father-in-law, Jack Tworkov, a painter; the Surrealist painter Marcel Duchamp; the photographer Walker Evans, with whom Mr. Moscowitz worked; Alfred Hitchcock, and Samuel Beckett. But the paintings he was doing were not finding a receptive audience, and he was devoting much of his energy to work outside his studio.\nMr. Moskowitz was born in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and illustrated technical manuals for the Sperry Gyroscope Company during the late 1950's while studying graphic design at night at Pratt. He was derailed from his intended career as a technical illustrator by Mr. Gottlieb, whose painting class at Pratt persuaded him to become an artist.\nMr. Moskowitz spent much of the next decade doing bleak, enigmatic paintings of corners of rooms. ''The corner paintings were considered Minimalism in that there wasn't a lot going on with the canvases,'' he said. ''But I had images, while the Minimalists were abstract. The corners came out of a book on decorating I'd found in a used-book store. I wanted to make them look like rooms you could go into. But I found they became closed and too perfect, so I started to violate the surfaces.'' These violations first took the form of tiny blotches of paint. On later canvases, they became geometric shapes and eventually quirky but more recognizable images, like a smile and a duck's head.\nThe late 1960's and 1970's, however, were difficult years, Mr. Moskowitz acknowledged. He had only a handful of gallery shows, and they were poorly received. He now feels this was because his paintings were ''different from most work being shown at the time, and they weren't aggressive in grabbing people's attention.'' He made his living driving a taxi three nights a week, while making canvas stretchers for other artists and teaching often uninterested students during the day at the Maryland Institute of Art in Baltimore and the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.\nMr. Moskowitz's fortunes started to improve in the late 1970's, when his work was exhibited at the Clocktower gallery, an alternative space just down the street from his loft, and in a now-famous group show called ''New Image Painting'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Included in the Whitney show was his diptych of the World Trade Center reminiscent of works by Georgia O'Keeffe or Charles Demuth. It was one of his many paintings of the period of skyscrapers like the Flati=ron and Empire State Buildings in New York and the Wrigley Building in Chicago.\nAnother stylistic shift occurred around 1982, when Mr. Moskowitz began to experiment with flat, silhouetted images of sculptures like Rodin's ''Thinker,'' Brancusi's ''Bird in Space'' and Giacometti's ''Elongated Figure.'' ''I wanted to see what would happen if you took sculpture and tried to paint it,'' he said.\nIn much of his work, however, Mr. Moskowitz has attempted to capture a feeling of immensity - either with tiny images in the midst of huge canvases, large subjects like skyscrapers and icebergs, or oversize close-ups of a bowler's arm in motion. ''Scale is definitely an issue for me,'' he said. ''The scale brings you closer or pushes you back from the image.'' Mr. Moskowitz will talk about the ideas behind his work in general terms - he says, for instance, that he uses colors and images as metaphors for people and relationships - but he does not like to discuss the meaning of particular works. ''I make a painting first, and later figure out what it means,'' he said.\nAlthough he has regularly shown his work at the Blum Helman Gallery in recent years, he has avoided contractual ties with any gallery. ''I accumulate a certain amount of work over two or three years, and then think about having a show and trying to sell the work,'' he said. Many of his large canvases line the walls of his spacious studio, which is connected by various passageways to his living area, his wife's studio and his son's studio and apartment.", "The California gunman who killed at least four people and hospitalized 10 more - including two children as parents took their children to school - has been identified as Kevin Janson Neal, 43.\nNeal, who sometimes used the name Smith, was identified as the shooter after his Tuesday rampage, which climaxed with him smashing into a school's gates and firing into its walls and windows.\nFamily say he was addicted to drugs and was awaiting trial for stabbing a neighbor in a feud.\nHe began his rampage near his home on Bobcat Lane in the Rancho Tehama Reserve at 7.52am, shooting people at random before stealing a truck and performing drive-bys on homes, pedestrians and other drivers.\nNeal eventually arrived at the Rancho Tehama Elementary School and smashed through its gates before firing as many as 100 bullets through windows and walls, hitting one child, and trying to enter classrooms. He then fled, and was shot dead by police near the property.\n'I thought there was a car accident,' Stephanie Turner, who was dropping off her children, aged six and seven, at the time, told the Sacramento Bee of Neal's assault on the school gates.\nAccording to the local school district, Neal shot through windows and walls, hitting one child in a classroom, who had to be airlifted to hospital and is in stable condition.\nHe also attempted to enter classrooms in order to continue his rampage, but the school had been locked down, preventing access, Fox News reported.\nThe gunman is believed to have fired between 90 and 100 rounds. A semi-automatic rifle and two handguns were retrieved from the scene.\nThat child was identified as Alejandro Hernandez, 6; he was hit in the chest and foot, according to a cousin who started a GoFundMe page for him.\nHe was airlifted to Mercy Medical Center in Redding in critical condition, but is expected to recover, according to his cousin, Aly Monroy.\nOne parent, Coy Ferreira, who was dropping off his daughter at the kindergarten at the time, told local station KRCR that he was there when the first shots were fired.\nHe said that a school employee ushered parents and children into the building.\nSchool district officials said that other children were injured by glass when the windows were shot out.\nAfter firing on the school, Neal stole another car and drove off, but was shot dead at a nearby intersection by police after a brief gunfight.\nThe shooting appears to have come after a long period of instability from Neal, including stabbing one of his neighbors.\nTehama County District Attorney Gregg Cohen told ChicoER that on January 31, a long-standing dispute between Neal and two female neighbors came to a head when he shot at them and attacked one with a knife.\nHe said Neal opened fire on the neighbors as they walked along a wooden fence.\nHe reportedly then jumped the fence, stabbed one of them and stole the other's cellphone.\nTehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston told Fox News that one of the victims was the woman he shot in January, although it's not clear if she was fatally wounded.\nPolice are still working out the exact motive for the shooting.\nAfter the January attack, Neal was arrested and charged with second-degree burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, two counts of false imprisonment by violence, discharge of a firearm with gross negligence, possession of an assault weapon and misdemeanor battery.\nBail was set at $160,000; he was due to go to trial in January 2018.\nCourt documents say he had an AR-15 Bushmaster rifle - which has been used in multiple mass shootings - although it's not yet known if it was used in Tuesday's shooting.\nNeal's family says he had a violent temper and had no business owning firearms.\nKevin Neal's sister told The Associated Press she believes her brother was addicted to drugs.\nSheridan Orr said she had not talked to her brother in months and was appalled when she heard about the shooting.\nDistrict Attorney Gregg Cohen said that while the school incident was shocking, it came at the close of Neal's 45-minute rampage, during which four other victims were killed.\n'Obviously, the school gets all the attention, but there were many other people who were killed by his hands,' he said.\nNeal's neighbors said they had been complaining for weeks about the gunman, who lived on the street, firing his gun late at night and early in the morning.\nBut on Tuesday morning the nuisance turned deadly when Neal fired at several people, killing one man in his driveway.\nFrom there, Neal used one of his neighbor's vehicles to drive into town where he crashed it. Before going to the school, he stole another person's car and used that to get to the school.\nOn his way, he opened fire on a woman and her daughter who were in a Ford truck on the main road leading into the town.\nBoth were taken to hospital along with three children and an adult from the school.\nAnother person was reportedly shot at Stagecoach Road and Oak Park Road, another intersection leading in to the town.\nThe gunman then arrived at the school and fired between 90 and 100 rounds before police arrived.\nHe then stole another car and fled to a nearby intersection before being gunned down in a brief gunfight with police.\nAll of the people who were killed were adults. It is not yet clear if anyone else lost their life elsewhere in the small town.\nTehama County Sheriff's Deputies are still grappling with the facts and have confirmed that they are working across seven different crime scenes where they believe the gunman attacked.\nAt a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, sheriff's deputy Phil Johnston said the gunman went on a 'shooting rampage' after injuring at least one person on Bobcat Lane.\n'The initial call was shots fired with a man down; directly after that multiple 911 calls from various sources at multiple locations including the elementary school.\nHe continued: 'Right now we have no known motive, we know of no real connection to any of the victims. Most of the victims in this case appear to be random selections,' he said.\nWitnesses have since described seeing the gunman drive through the town and selecting victims at random, firing his weapon at them from behind the wheel of his car.\nOne told how he saw a woman shot dead in the street next to her husband. One student was taken to hospital from the school.\nWitnesses described hearing 'hundreds' of rounds as the shooting unfolded. Another, who lives near the school, described hearing children screaming.\n'We heard multiple shots, starting with about 10, and proceeding to about 90 shots, of a high powered some kind of rifle sounding.\n'We heard a man and children screaming from my location, I'm about three blocks from the school, I could hear people screaming at the school,' one witness, who gave her name only as Tiffany, told ABC affiliate KRCTV.\nOne man who lives on the street where the shooting began claims it was his roommate who was killed.\n'I got a call to say the person who stays in my house had been shot.\n'I drove home and the police have everything blocked off. I heard there was a shooting and I'm getting more information that my other neighbors were shot.\n'My truck was stolen and used today in the crime and it's terrible,' Brian Flint told KHSLTV.\nThe man added that the gunman was 'crazy' and that he was on bond for stabbing one of his female neighbors.\n'As far as we know he was crazy. He shoots a lot of gunshots at night, in the morning. Like a hundred rounds,' he said.\nHe claimed to have called police numerous times to report the man for shooting his gun late at night and early in the morning.\nAfter opening fire on his neighbors, the gunman drove 1.3 miles before opening fire again on a person at the corner of Stagecoach Road and Oak Park Road.\nThe circumstances of that shooting, which was reported by Red Bluff Daily News, are not known.\nHe then opened fire on the woman and her child at Rancho Tehama Road, shooting them through the window of their grey Ford pick-up truck before moving on to the school.\nParents were dropping off their children at the time and some hid inside along with teachers when the first rounds were fired.\nRancho Tehama is around 120 miles north of Sacramento and sits between the towns of Red Bluff and Corning.\nAfter the shooting, Governor Jerry Brown issued this statement: 'Anne and I are saddened to hear about today's violence in Tehama County, which shockingly involved schoolchildren.\nCecile Juliette KHSL on Twitter: \"https://t.co/eEes0lezQb\"", "US president George Bush says Iran must comply with a set of demands before relations between the two countries can improve.\nBush said on Thursday that helping Iranians after last week's devastating earthquake was the right thing to do, but that US aid did not signal a thaw in relations with Tehran.\n\"What we're doing in Iran is we're showing the Iranian people the American people care, that they've got great compassion for human suffering,\" he told reporters after hunting quail in Farfullias, Texas, with his father.\nBut if Tehran wants better relations, it must turn over any member of Usama bin Ladin's al-Qaida network it has in custody, abandon efforts to develop unconventional weapons, and embrace political reforms.\n\"The Iranian government must listen to the voices of those who long for freedom, must turn over al-Qaida that are in their custody and must abandon their nuclear weapons program,\" he said.\nad hinted that US aid to earthquake victims may have eased decades of mistrust between the two arch-foes.\nDuring a memorial service at Bam's Friday Mosque the country's former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said recent developments could have an impact on the hostile relations between Washington and Tehran.\n\"I'm not sure but the signs indicate that,\" the official IRNA news agency reported him as saying on Thursday.\nPresident Muhammad Khatami's brother went further, implying the US response to the earthquake might win an unspecified reciprocal gesture from Iran.\n\"We're evaluating the American government's positive behaviour and I'm sure that goodwill will be answered with goodwill,\" Muhammad Reza Khatami, deputy parliament speaker and Khatami's younger brother, said.\nHowever, earlier this week the president himself said US-Iranian problems were rooted in history and would not be altered by the US aid.\nWashington broke ties with Iran shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution and dubs it part of the \"axis of evil\".\nBut it has sent scores of relief workers to Bam and tonnes of aid to Iran.\nIt has also temporarily eased some sanctions on the Islamic Republic to speed the delivery of humanitarian relief, and hinted at a willingness to resume some dialogue with Tehran.\nRelief workers pulled a young man and a child alive from the ruins six days after the quake flattened the medieval town 1000km southeast of Tehran.\n\"At least we've saved one life. I have been in war and through many struggles and I've never been so happy,\" Red Crescent worker Ali Ashghar Namdari said after a dazed and mumbling shopkeeper was discovered under a wardrobe.\nRelief workers in Bam said shopkeeper Yadollah Saadat was found alongside the corpses of six dead relatives.\n\"They thought he was dead and then they realised he was alive,\" his wife, Fatimeh Asghari, 22, said as she sat next to Saadat being examined by medics. \"I can't express how happy I am.\"\nAnd Iran state radio said a nine-year-old girl covered with dust and dirt had also been rescued from the rubble of her family's flattened house. She was described as in fragile condition.\nGovernment officials have said the final death toll from the quake, measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale, may reach 50,000, making it one of the worst natural disasters of recent decades.", "I wish to express my pride in being born and raised in the little town of Confluence. It is a beautiful area and is populated by good people and good neighbors.\nYou know if you need help there are always people around the area who will come to your aid. Little churches will prepare meals and serve them to people attending funerals for their loved ones. Neighbors will take food to the homes of grieving families. In the winter, people will shovel snow from the sidewalks of the elderly or sick. In the summer, people will share vegetables from their gardens. Town merchants will extend credit to people having a problem or give discounts or merchandise or labor to benefit community programs. People also donate money to neighbors they know are having hard times such as sickness or a fire. We also have the service of a volunteer fire department and ambulance service. Citizens give up their own time for these services which we couldn't live without.\nOne church in our community sponsors spaghetti dinners with the profits going to people for medical expenses and fire losses. It takes special people to be the backbone of this program. One such person is Mary Ellen Deal. Since its inception she has diligently helped prepare these special meals which help others.\nWe are also blessed with people who serve on our town council and have to bear the criticism of others. We also have school board members who give up their time to help operate and improve our little school system sometimes enduring severe, unjustified criticism.\nThe rest of us should greatly appreciate the efforts and service of all of these people and realize that 99 percent of the people in our town are good law-abiding citizens.", "It might seem that New York-based indie distributor A24, two years after claiming a best picture victory with Barry Jenkins\u2019 \u201cMoonlight,\u201d and a year removed from the success of Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird,\u201d is set for a low-key Oscar season in 2018.\nFilms like Bo Burnham\u2019s \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d Paul Schrader\u2019s \u201cFirst Reformed\u201d and Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cHereditary\u201d certainly echo the small-but-acclaimed paradigm of previous players, but they and Jonah Hill\u2019s \u201cMid90s\u201d seem unlikely to catch fire in the Academy\u2019s top race. It will be particularly difficult to gain a foothold with the major studios roaring back this year with films like \u201cBlack Panther\u201d (Disney), \u201cGreen Book\u201d (Universal), \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d (Warner Bros.), and \u201cWidows\u201d (Fox).\nNevertheless, here\u2019s a bit of Oscar trivia for you: A24 has secured at least two screenplay nominations in each of the past three years, including three in 2016. Some of them, like Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d Mike Mills\u2019 \u201c20th Century Women\u201d and Alex Garland\u2019s \u201cEx Machina,\u201d proved to be pleasant surprises. So don\u2019t, by any means, count out the six-year-old company for a run at some serious bling. There is a solid quartet of films to work with, one that perfectly represents A24\u2019s artist-haven swagger.\nSchrader\u2019s picture, about a priest dealing with self-doubt, was the first into theaters, arriving last May, half a year after unspooling at the 2017 Venice and Telluride film festivals. The uncompromising 72-year-old writer-director has not been so well-received since his 1998 drama \u201cAffliction,\u201d which won James Coburn a supporting actor Oscar and earned Nick Nolte a nomination in lead. But Schrader was not recognized by the Academy for that film, or, for that matter, any of the cinematic milestones he\u2019s helped conjure throughout the years, from \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d to \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d That could change this time around, and the campaign is certainly banking on industry goodwill \u2014 on top of the genuine acclaim \u201cFirst Reformed\u201d has generated in its own right \u2014 to bring him his first-ever Oscar bid.\nBut in an original screenplay category that is filling up fast with contenders like \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d \u201cGreen Book,\u201d \u201cRoma\u201d and \u201cVice,\u201d Schrader could find himself duking it out with stable mate Burnham for a spot. Burnham, a YouTube sensation, dropped \u201cEighth Grade, \u201d his directorial debut, at the Sundance Film Festival ahead of a mid-summer release that drew rave upon rave. It\u2019s exactly the kind of film \u2014 a coming-of-age dramedy about an introverted teenage girl \u2014 that grabs the writers branch\u2019s attention every year in lieu of much love elsewhere (not that lead actress Elsie Fisher isn\u2019t brilliant and deserving of serious consideration). Boots Riley\u2019s racially and politically tinged \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d at Annapurna is another example.\nBut who knows how that original screenplay category will unfold? There\u2019s certainly a world where both \u201cEighth Grade\u201d and \u201cFirst Reformed\u201d find purchase in the field, making good on A24\u2019s double-dipper track record. \u201cHereditary\u201d and \u201cMid90s,\u201d however, are taller orders all around.\nHill\u2019s movie, a personal ode to his SoCal skateboarding youth, is a little gem perfectly suited to its distributor. But it failed to register any nominations from the Independent Filmmaker Project\u2019s Gotham Awards in New York, and turned out just one notice from West Coast Film Independent\u2019s Spirit Awards last week, so it\u2019s bringing up the rear with this group. \u201cHereditary,\u201d which earned Gotham and Spirit nods for breakthrough/first-time director and lead actress (Toni Collette\u2019s sweat-inducing performance getting the love it deserves), has a little more going for it. Genre bias may not be much of a hurdle with the Academy anymore; we\u2019re coming off a year dominated by films like \u201cGet Out\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d after all. But horror, and particularly gruesome horror like \u201cHereditary,\u201d seems like it will continue to struggle.\nUltimately, A24\u2019s slate of contenders this year is a stellar one worth fighting for. What\u2019s more, it feels like yet another extension of the company\u2019s identity. Awards-season perennial Fox Searchlight seems like the only other company that can boast as much from all its years on the circuit. Maybe the votes will be there for these films, maybe they won\u2019t. But come what may, here\u2019s hoping A24 \u2014 which just signed a production pact with Apple, ensuring longevity in the streaming space \u2014 will keep on keeping on.", "Valerie Birk of Flossmoor loves zucchini bread, so she and her husband, Tom, decided to plant zucchini in their garden this year.\n''I planted a whole packet of seeds; I don`t know what it`ll yield,'' she admits.\nIf Birk were addressing an audience full of gardeners, her naivete might elicit a great, laugh-track-size guffaw. Gardeners know only too well the perils of growing too much zucchini and the humiliation of trying to get rid of it.\nIn fact, they`ve been known to crack a few jokes of their own. ''Take my zucchini, please,'' and ''nuke the zuke'' have crossed the lips of more than a few panic-stricken zucchini growers.\nStuck with the usual bumper crops, zucchini growers have been known to leave bags of the stuff on friends` doorsteps or on the desks of unsuspecting coworkers.\nBut gardeners don`t learn. They keep planting and harvesting, planting and harvesting.\n''People overplant because they don`t believe it will yield as much as it does,'' explains Connie Porth of Libertyville, herself an overplanter.\nBut a ''too much can`t hurt'' attitude does, reports Hal Sanger Jr. of Maywood. ''You lose all your friends, neighbors and relatives,'' he says.\nAfter a gardener`s first generous outpouring, recipients can turn hostile. ''Look out, here comes Hal with those zucchini,'' quotes repentant Hal.\nStill, there must be some reason zucchini, a bland summer squash that sprouts with the ease of fast-food restaurants, is so popular. ''It`s easy to grow,'' says Laura Bartoszek, horticulturist with the University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service of Du Page County.\nZucchini has been pureed, sauteed, stuffed, fried, frittered, chopped, diced, sliced, minced and mashed, then cooked and baked into breads, cakes, pies, soups, stews, salads, casseroles and meat and poultry dishes.\nZucchini, which means ''little squash'' in Italian, also stands on its own in myriad tomato-based side dishes where it`s spiced and seasoned to a pulp, or simply puckered into a pickle.\nIn Italy, the zucchini`s flowers and seeds are considered a delicacy, says Nona Koivula, executive director of the National Garden Bureau. The blooms are coated in batter and sauteed. The seeds are baked like pumpkin seeds.\nMarilyn Kruecke, also of Lake Bluff, takes the zucchini-as-shell concept one step further: ''I scoop it out and use it as a plate,'' she says.\nThat takes care of some of the crop, but what about the rest?\nSize is another sore spot for zucchini owners. Young and tender, 2 inches in diameter and 6 to 8 inches long is the ideal zucchini. That requires harvesting every two to three days. But the large, luscious leaves often hide the plant until ''you stumble across one that`s turned into a monster,'' says Kruecke, who like others stalking the ''wild'' zucchini tends to anthropomorphize her garden`s tenants.\n''A large zucchini reminds me of a crocodile in waiting,'' she whispers.\nWhen zucchini grow to the size of small children, the only thing to be done with them is use them for baseball bats, offers one gardener, or enter them in a contest. To win, you`ll have to beat the 3-foot-long, 65-pound zucchini that took the prize one year at the Winnebago County Fair.\nBut the best advice for disposing of zucchini comes from Connie Porth. Her favorite recipe for zucchini bread instructs the baker to ''set aside two to three cups of zucchini.'' The zucchini is never mentioned again.\nThe beauty of zucchini, gardeners argue, is its versatility. In fact, it can be incorporated into every course of a meal, often undetected. If you`re game enough or desparate enough to try it, here are a few recipes that when combined, make an all-zucchini menu. We`ve included a recipe for a chocolate cake that, unlike Marilyn Kruecke`s, calls for zucchini--and uses it.\nby Ruth Conrad Bateman (Crown Publishers, $4.95).\n1. Put zucchini and green onions in large heavy saucepan with chicken broth. Cover and cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.\n2. Puree in blender and add buttermilk. Blend until smooth and season to taste with salt, if needed, freshly ground pepper and basil, tarragon or leafy green fennel tops.\n3. Cover and chill several hours to mellow flavors. Stir smooth again and adjust seasonings, if necessary.\n4. Serve in chilled bowls or cups with a topping of minced parsley or snipped green fennel tops.\nThe following recipe is adapted from ''Fresh Garden Vegetables'' by Libby Hillman (Harper & Row Publishers, $8.95).\n1. Cut off one lengthwise slice from each zucchini about 1/4-inch thick, and discard it. Scoop out the squash without tearing the skin leaving a 1/4- inch thick shell. Chop the scooped-out portion very finely; mix it with all the remaining ingredients.\n2. Stuff the zucchini shells with the mixture. Wrap each piece in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Grill over hot coals, turning occasionally, until tender, about 30 minutes.\nNote: To prepare indoors, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Do not wrap the squash in foil; bake in a covered casserole for 35 to 40 minutes. Uncover the casserole for last 5 minutes to allow the zucchini to brown.\nThe following recipe was developed by Michelle Eisen, a foods and nutrition student at Mundelein College.\n1. Put zucchini in strainer. Sprinkle with salt. Let drain about 45 minutes. Rinse with cold water to remove the salt; drain well. Set aside.\n2. Meanwhile, mix garlic, onion, green pepper, mushrooms and olive oil in a medium skillet. Saute until tender, about 10 minutes, do not overcook. Strain vegetables; discard liquid. Mix vegetables with tomato paste. Set aside.\n3. Heat broiler. Lightly grease a 1 1/2-inch deep 8-inch round tinfoil baking pan.\n4. Mix eggs, basil, pepper, oregano, 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese, 1/2 of the parmesan cheese and flour with drained zucchini in medium bowl. Pour into prepared pan. Broil until golden and firm, about 10 minutes.\n5. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread tomato paste mixture over zucchini crust. Top with remaining cheeses. Bake until top is golden, about 10 to 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack for 10 minutes. Serve.\nThe following recipe is adapted from ''The Zucchini and Carrot Cookbook''.\n1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 13 by 9 by-inch baking pan.\n2. Put zucchini in saucepan with 1/2 cup water (or orange juice) and 1/ 2 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook gently until tender enough to mash or puree, about 10 minutes. Drain if necessary and mash or puree in blender until smooth. You should have 1 cup puree.\n3. Sift flour with baking soda, baking powder, spices, cocoa and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Beat eggs in large mixer bowl until very light. Gradually beat in sugar until mixture is fluffy and a pale ivory color. Slowly beat in oil, beating to keep mixture light.\n4. Mix zucchini puree and buttermilk. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture alternately with buttermilk mixture. Blend on low speed of mixer or with rubber scraper until well mixed. Stir in vanilla, orange rind and nuts. Pour into prepared pan.\n5. Bake at 350 degrees, until cake shrinks slightly from sides and tester is clean when stuck in center and removed, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool layers 10 minutes on wire rack. Remove to wire racks to cool completely.\n6. Drizzle with orange glaze and cool completely.\nOrange glaze: Sift 1 cup confectioners` sugar into medium bowl. Stir in 1 tablespoon orange juice, 1 teaspoon shredded fresh orange rind and 1 tablespoon bubbling hot, melted butter or margarine. Blend until smooth.", "Amid the current financial turmoil, the causes of the crisis that just preceded it\u2014the bursting of the housing bubble\u2014are being badly distorted. Some analysts, including the authors of the book under review, are arguing that the housing and financial crises of 2007 and 2008 were the direct result of federal guarantees of mortgages, a program first created in the 1930s, and therefore less so the result of the aggressive creation of mortgages by private business than has been widely reported.\nIn particular, the authors accuse two quasi-public but profit-making companies, Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), of adding risks to the mortgage markets that resulted in disaster. Much the same criticism has been made by Peter Wallison, a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, who wrote an angry dissent to the findings of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), which was appointed by Congress to investigate the causes of the crash.1 Contrary to Wallison, the nine other members of the commission, including three others appointed by Republicans, concluded that Fannie and Freddie were not the main causes of the crisis.\nAlong with many other experts, the nine members pointed to considerable evidence that, despite large losses, these government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), as they are known, bought or guaranteed too few highly risky loans, and did so too late in the 2000s, to cause the crisis. But in their new book, Reckless Endangerment, the New York Times reporter Gretchen Morgenson and mortgage securities analyst Joshua Rosner try to revive the issue of their responsibility.\nThis bold claim, however, is not substantiated by persuasive analysis or by any hard evidence in the book. The GSEs did generate large losses, but their bad investments in housing loans followed rather than led the crisis; most of those investments involved purchases or guarantees made well after the subprime and housing bubbles had been expanded by private loans and were almost about to burst.", "SANTA CRUZ \u2014 The La Bahia hotel project is no longer at a standstill.\nSC Hotel Partners LLC submitted an application in February to the City of Santa Cruz for a building permit for the project at 215 Beach St.\nLa Bahia is owned by the Santa Cruz Seaside Company and is being developed by the Chicago-based real estate development company Prime Group Inc. This is a joint venture called SC Hotel Partners LLC.\nThe 44-unit Spanish Colonial La Bahia Apartments were built in 1926. The planned 165-room hotel will have banquet and meeting space, two restaurants, a pool and a spa and 244 on-site parking spaces, according to Kris Reyes, spokesperson for the Santa Cruz Seaside Co. He said no one currently lives in the apartments besides the property manager.\n\u201cIt will generate significant transient occupancy tax for the city, create quality jobs and add a world-class hotel to the beach area,\u201d Reyes said in a prepared statement.\nThe bell tower building will be restored, but all other parts of the structure will be destroyed, according to Ryan Bane, City of Santa Cruz\u2019s senior planner.\nSC Hotel Partners LLC is preserving the southeast corner of the existing property, including the bell tower, Reyes said in a prepared statement. He said that portion of the property will be restored and the interior will be converted into historic hotel guest rooms.\nReyes said costs to construct and open the hotel are anticipated at $90 million.\nThe project has a long stop-and-go history. Santa Cruz City Council approved a proposal in June 2003 to develop a 118-room hotel from the existing La Bahia structures, according to a 2014 staff report. Barry Swenson Builder, proposed a $30 million project, according to Sentinel staff.\nSwenson dropped the project, however, for financial reasons and Craig French was hired as the developer in 2012. In 2014, the California Coastal Commission denied an appeal that the developer\u2019s plans to restore certain parts of the building didn\u2019t comply with the city\u2019s beach area plan. The Commission said the project was in line with a separate coastal plan they had already approved, and Craig French had kept the building\u2019s height within zoning limits, according to an earlier Sentinel article. The project architecture and design complies with the City\u2019s beach area plan, according to Reyes.\nReyes said an anticipated 75-100 employees will be brought on for this project. He said the Seaside Co. anticipates starting construction in the summer and it will be completed in two years from the time construction begins.", "Commercial security: it\u2019s all about integration these days.\nOwners and operators of commercial facilities are no longer looking for individual security solutions. Today they want a package that offers all the aspects of security they need. Whether a property is owner-occupied or tenant-occupied, providing the most efficient security to ensure the safety of people and the protection of intellectual and physical property is critical.\nEmployee\u2019s that commit theft, armed robbery and information security are major concerns and companies invest heavily with the aim of bolstering security, protecting people, and solving security problems. This requires alarms, fire protection systems, video surveillance, access control systems, and intrusion detection devices. All technology that, in the hands of capable security operators, can significantly reduce risk, cut losses and keep people safe. The problem, however, comes with the challenge of keeping security staff trained on distinct stand-alone systems. If each of the key components of security \u2013 namely intrusion detection, access control, and video surveillance \u2013 is purchased separately, the training and administration thereof can become a costly burden.\nInstead of having intrusion alarms on one system, administering access control on another standalone database and having intelligent digital video technology run elsewhere on its own dedicated computer equipment. By integrating these separate systems under a flexible automated system, the need to have separate service, maintenance, administration, and training for each system is eliminated. An integrated solution allows office park administrators and the like to realise a lower upfront investment for a security system that is more powerful. Installation and training occur on a single system and running costs like service and maintenance are also cut significantly, as one company becomes responsible for all of that.\nAn efficient, automated integrated system would be worthless without high-quality input devices. CCTV cameras are an important security component at office parks, buildings, in hallways as well as parking areas. This is where efficiency can be improved even further in the commercial environment, by using next-generation component devices. Ultra-high resolution cameras (\u201c4K cameras\u201d) can be used in the surveillance security, and these newer cameras have embedded processors that enable video to be compressed within the device and transmitted real-time over IP networks to Network Video Recorders (NVRs) that centrally manage video feeds from numerous IP cameras.\nStreaming video can be continuously recorded and if an incident occurs, disk indexing and time-stamping make it easier to find video from a set date and time. As for the implications of the Protection of Personal Information Act on surveillance footage, the system\u2019s video management software has the facility to re-record over the oldest information. Where, in some organisations footage is required to be digitally available and stored for a period of 30 days (or longer), the NVR will replace expired footage when the network storage space has been depleted. Where, for example, PoPI states that certain information cannot be kept for more than 30 days, the management system can be programmed so that it erases information after 30 days.\nHow is this possible? Behind the CCTV system lies an intelligent video analytics engine that increases the productivity of security staff that are tasked with monitoring many cameras. This technology examines the 4K camera\u2019s field of view for patterns of movement that indicate something is happening out of the norm, like someone climbing a fence, running a tripline, etc. Video analytics allows the security operator to focus on managing surveillance by exception events rather than having to monitor all events for an exception.\nBy using an integrated approach in commercial properties, the companies and the occupants that work in such buildings will benefit. Integration means a lower installation and operating costs, because it cuts out component and system redundancy and allows for the streamlining of security operations. As a result, it reduces training requirements and enables security operators to perform their duties more efficiently, which in turn contributes to enhanced safety and security which is, at the end of the day, a massive feat.", "Niagara Falls, N.Y. \u2014 The Thames River, the biggest Canadian source of phosphorus entering Lake Erie, will undergo a pollution makeover, with a $7.5-million project that could then become a template for American states that contribute even more to the lake\u2019s annual algae blanket.\nTributaries to the Thames, including Medway Creek north of London and McGregor and Jeannette\u2019s creeks near Chatham, will be the main focus of efforts to reduce the level of phosphorus in Erie, mayors of Great Lakes municipalities said here Thursday.\n\u201cHopefully this is a template that we can share with our (American) neighbours,\u201d said Huron-Kinloss Mayor Mitch Twolan, immediate past-chairperson of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, a binational group of 123 mayors.\nThe five-year plan will include municipalities working collaboratively with farmers on improved water management and drainage to prevent and contain fertilizer runoff.\nPhosphorus and heat fuel enormous algae blooms in western Lake Erie every year \u2014 so large and toxic that in 2014 Toledo had to shut its drinking water intakes.\nThe main source of the phosphorus is fertilizer runoff from farms. And the single biggest conduit \u2014 \u201cthe motherlode of nutrient loading,\u201d said Karl Gephart, deputy director for water resources with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 is the Maumee River watershed in Ohio.\nIt\u2019s estimated the Maumee alone seeds as much as 80 per cent of the lake\u2019s entire algae bloom.\n\u201cWe\u2019re beyond the finger-pointing. Everyone has a piece of this action and everyone has the responsibility to help fix it,\u201d Gephart said.\n\u201cThis is an international problem and it will require international solutions,\u201d said Don McCabe, head of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture.\nOhio, Ontario and Michigan have committed to reducing phosphorus into Lake Erie by 40 per cent by 2025.\nShe said municipalities have regulations about discharging wastewater but, in Ohio, that\u2019s mostly not the case for agriculture.\nAnd Flanagan said so much farm fertilizer runs into the Maumee River that even eliminating all other phosphorus sources from that watershed would reduce the load by only 15 per cent.\nThe algae bloom in Lake Erie was so large and so toxic in 2014 that Toledo had to shut off its drinking water intakes temporarily.\nLast year\u2019s algae bloom spread even farther than in 2014 but was less toxic. And the DNA stamp of some of that algae bears markers from the Thames River in Ontario, the same Thames that runs through some of the province\u2019s most fertile farm fields.\nMcCabe said regulations in Ontario are far more stringent than in the U.S. and that no one ever intends to over-use fertilizers anywhere.\n\u201cNo farmer buys phosphorus uptown and spreads it on the ground (just) to go visit it on the beach,\u201d he said.\nThe planned $1.5 million spending each year for five years would come from various sources, including advocacy groups, the Great Lakes mayors group, governments and conservation authorities. It would be used to help monitor when and where phosphorus is entering drainage areas.\nMcCabe said it\u2019s \u201cchump change\u201d in comparison with the size and scope of what\u2019s happening throughout the Lake Erie watersheds.\nBut municipalities, governments and farmers all need to start making this a priority.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one rule in agriculture: Mother Nature wins.

These finding may also be applied to other planets.\n\"This is very much a discovery-based science, and there is so much we still don't understand,\" Baross said during the Search for Life Beyond the Solar System conference in Tucson, Ariz.\nOne emerging field of research examines microbes living in a low carbon and energy environment, like the parts of the ocean below where sunlight can reach through the waters. Considering slower evolution over millions of years in these reaches is a \"totally new ballgame\" for alien planet researchers, Baross said.\nHosts for the conference include the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory as well as the Vatican Observatory, which is based just outside of Rome. Historically, science and religion have at times come to loggerheads at the Vatican. For example, when Galileo Galilei discovered moons around Jupiter in 1610, he said the Earth orbits sun rather than the other way around, in defiance of the church.\nThe Vatican Observatory has made its own contributions to astronomy, pointed out Jos\u00e9 Funes, its current director. The 19th-century director Angelo Secchi was one of the first scientists to authoritatively say that the sun is a star, Funes said.\nSecchi, like scientists today, also mused on the possibility of life beyond Earth, a theme that Vatican scientists discussed at the conference, Funes added, putting a passage from Secchi's 1870 book, \"Le Soleil\" (The Sun) on the screen.\n\"What to think of these stars without any doubt similar to our sun,\" the passage read, \"destined like the sun to keep alive an enormous quantity of creatures of every kind?\"\nFinding alien life will be a complex task, other scientists pointed out. Perhaps extraterrestrials will require a \"wet\" planet like Earth and a \"dry\" planet like Mars to pass material back and forth, biochemist Steven Benner of The Westheimer Institute for Science and Technology in Florida said.\nBenner suggested that it might be easier for organisms to come alive in a dry environment, but that it would take water to make sustained life possible.\nOther researchers, meanwhile, are trying to better understand the parameters of life by creating synthetic lifeforms to see how they will behave in different environments. Lynn Rothschild of NASA's Ames Research Center, is the faculty adviser for Brown University and Stanford University students participating in the annual International Genetically Engineered Machine competition.\nUsing DNA samples in a library, the students build artificial systems meant to address certain scientific questions like how to be more resistant to radiation. This can help supplement research on extremophiles where \"there are not a lot of studies,\" Rothschild said.", "A former Camp Lejeune Naval Hospital psychiatrist who claimed his contract with the hospital was wrongfully terminated in 2009 has recently filed a federal whistleblower lawsuit in U.S. District Court.\nIn the lawsuit, Dr. Kernan Manion, a board certified psychiatrist for more than 25 years, claims he was wrongfully terminated for reporting mishandled cases of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune Health Center. He also claims the center lacked the safety protocols necessary to protect those at the base from patients who were diagnosed as potentially violent to themselves or others.\nManion filed the lawsuit against the contracting companies that hired him to work at the hospital: Spectrum Healthcare Resources and Nitelines Kuhana JV LLC.\nThe suit describes two cases in which Manion witnessed violent acts by his patients, one of which recounts a post-deployment Marine who, in a diagnosed psychotic rage, repeatedly karate-punched a table and stormed out of his session. There was \"no support available nor even protocol in place to contain or subdue the patient ... or to emergently and safely get him to urgent care,\" according to the suit.\nThe other incident describes Manion's account of watching a service member repeatedly punch a telephone pole with his bare fists, after which he picked up a piece of lumber with a nail protruding through it and walked through the grounds cursing to himself.\nManion \"promptly notified appropriate authorities and yet found grossly deficient responses,\" according to the suit.\nWhen he brought the issues to the attention of his supervisors and to Capt. Gerard Cox, the commanding officer of Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune at the time, he claims he was ignored, and Nitelines informed him in writing to cease and desist all communication with the government.\nTwo months later, in September 2009, he filed an urgent complaint to the inspector general of the Department of Defense asking him to address the issues his supervisors would not. Nitelines terminated his contract two days after he filed the complaint.\nHis complaint prompted an onsite quality assurance investigation, which took place in December of that year, according to archived Daily News reports. Findings from the reviews are protected under U.S. Code title 10, section 1102; however, in February of 2010 then-commander of Navy Medicine East Rear Adm. Bob Kiser, told The Daily News that he was satisfied with the results of those reviews.\nManion is now asking the court to grant damages based on the loss of pay and benefits from his termination, as well as compensation for \"severe emotional distress, humiliation, anxiety and damages to reputation and future employment.\" The suit also asks that the court reinstate Manion to his former position as a psychiatrist at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune.\nManion's attorney, Washington, D.C. lawyer Richard Renner, said in general, most whistleblowers seek reinstatement to their former positions because they \"tend to be the types of employees who take to heart the mission of the organization and just find themselves in conflict with supervisors who have ulterior motives.\"\nManion told The Daily News he had been advised by his lawyers not to comment on the lawsuit.\nNiteline Vice President Charles Broom also declined to comment, and Spectrum President George Tracy said they could not \"comment about any pending litigation, but please note that we are a subcontractor with administrative duties related to staffing and we do not have any clinical or procedural authority at all.\"\nWhen asked whether Spectrum had the ability to fire Manion, Tracy repeated his statement.\nRenner said the defendants are expected to answer the complaint within the month.", "In 1961, The New Yorker sent a reporter to cover the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the chief architects of the Third Reich\u2019s Final Solution, who had been kidnapped by Mossad operatives in Argentina and brought to Jerusalem to stand trial for his crimes. The writer was Hannah Arendt and the five-part article which emerged, \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem,\u201d set off what is considered to be one of the most passionate public debates concerning the Holocaust ever to take place.\nLike so many Jewish writers of her generation, Arendt attempted in her work to shine the light of intellect on the extreme darkness she lived through. That she chose to do this in the most impersonal of genres\u2014philosophy and history\u2014rather than through memoir, or even poetry (which she loved to read, and wrote from time to time), is itself a clue to the immense psychological pressures that shaped her work and, in the end, partly disfigured it.\nAs the years passed, it became plain that she was one of those thinkers, rare in all history, who are empowered to inch human thought forward\u2014who can add something to man\u2019s knowledge and understanding of himself, who can push back the boundaries of where the mind can go. Her ideas, as original as they were, had about them the normality and the inevitability of truths that had been waiting somewhere to be found.\nI was struck by a manifest shallowness in the doer which made it impossible to trace the incontestable evil of his deeds to any deeper level of roots or motives. The deeds were monstrous, but the doer\u2014at least, the very effective one now on trial\u2014was quite ordinary, commonplace, and neither monstrous nor demonic.\nDuring the few minutes it took to tell of the help afforded by a German sergeant, a hush settled over the courtroom; it was as though the crowd had spontaneously decided to observe two minutes of silence in honor of the man named Anton Schmidt. And in those two minutes, which were like a sudden burst of light in the midst of impenetrable, unfathomable darkness, a single thought stood out clearly, irrefutably, beyond question: How utterly different everything would be today in this courtroom, in Israel, in Germany, in all of Europe, and perhaps in all the countries of the world, if only more such stories could be told!\nThere are, of course, explanations of this devastating shortage, and they have been repeated many times. I shall give the gist of them in the words of Peter Bamm, a German Army physician who had served at the Russian front, and whose book \u201cDie Unsichtbare Flagge,\u201d published in Munich in 1952, is among the very few subjectively sincere memoirs of its kind. He tells of the killing of Jews in Sevastopol. They were collected by \u201cthe others,\u201d as he calls the S.S. mobile killing units, to distinguish them from ordinary soldiers, whose decency the book extols, and were put into a sealed-off part of the former G.P.U. prison (which abutted on the officers\u2019 lodgings), where Dr. Bamm\u2019s own unit was quartered. Later, they were made to board a mobile gas van, in which they died after a few minutes, whereupon the driver transported the corpses outside the city and unloaded them into tank ditches. Dr. Bamm writes, \u201cWe knew this. We did nothing. Everyone who had seriously protested or acted against the killing unit would have been arrested within twenty-four hours and would have disappeared. It belongs among the refinements of totalitarian governments in our century that they don\u2019t permit their opponents to die a great, dramatic martyr\u2019s death for their convictions. A good many of us might have accepted such a death. The totalitarian state lets its opponents disappear in silent anonymity. It is certain that anyone who had dared to suffer death rather than silently tolerate the crime would have sacrificed his life in vain. This is not to say that such a sacrifice would have been morally meaningless. It would only have been practically useless...\u201d Needless to say, the writer remains unaware of the emptiness of what he elsewhere refers to as their \u201cdecency,\u201d in the absence of a \u201chigher moral meaning.\u201d But the hollowness of respectability\u2014for decency under such circumstances is no more than respectability\u2014was not what became apparent in the example afforded by Sergeant Anton Schmidt but, rather, the fatal flaw in the argument itself, which at first sounds so hopelessly plausible. It is true that the totalitarian state tried to establish holes of oblivion into which all deeds, good and evil, would disappear but just as the Nazis\u2019 feverish attempts, from June, 1942, on, to erase all traces of their massacres\u2014through cremation, through burning in open pits, through the use of explosives and flame-throwers and bone-crushing machinery\u2014were doomed to failure, so all efforts to let their \u201copponents disappear in silent anonymity\u201d were in vain. The holes of oblivion do not exist. Nothing human is perfect, and there are simply too many people in the world to make oblivion possible. One man will always be left alive to tell the story. Hence, nothing can ever be \u201cpractically useless\u201d\u2014at least, not in the long run. It would be of great practical usefulness for Germany today\u2014and not merely for her prestige abroad but for her sadly confused inner condition\u2014if there were more stories like Schmidt\u2019s to tell. For the lesson of such stories is simple and within everybody\u2019s grasp. Politically speaking, it is that under conditions of terror most people will comply but some people will not, just as the lesson of the countries to which the Final Solution was proposed is that \u201cit could happen\u201d almost anywhere but it did not happen everywhere.", "Law firm's Wright Hassall's agricultural team.\nA long established legal firm in Leamington Spa is expanding its operations to cope with an expected shake up in farming after Brexit.\nThe 170-year-old Wright Hassall, based in Olympus Avenue, which is renown for its expertise in farming matters, has just recruited three more agricultural specialists.\nThe firm says it is preparing for the approval of a new Agricultural Bill that will shape the future of the farming industry and is regarded as an outline of Britain\u2019s post-Brexit farming policy.\nThe company already has an impressive track record in agricultural law but says it wants to strengthen the range of that expertise.\nThe recent arrivals are Joel Woolf, a farmer\u2019s son from Suffolk, who advises on succession and business continuity, Vanessa Blane joins as a senior solicitor to concentrate on HS2 and other compulsory purchase or planning matters and Jon Clifford who will head up the Rural Disputes\u2019 team.\nIn the new Legal 500 and Chambers UK law directories the agricultural team has retained its top tier ranking, with solicitors Paul Rice, Alex Robinson, Joel Woolf, and Sarah Beer all cited as notable practitioners.\nThe directories state that staff have \u201can unrivalled knowledge around matters associated with development and reinvestment\u201d and that \u201cthey\u2019re technically excellent lawyers\u201d.\nMr Woolf said: \u201cWe are in a period where the face of the sector is set to fundamentally change.\n\u201cWith Brexit on the horizon, there are sure to be plenty of big decisions being made which will impact on every rural business from small family farms upwards.\nWright Hassall\u2019s agricultural team advises farmers, landowners, rural businesses and farming-related organisations and also has close connections with the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Country Land and Business Association, Warwickshire Rural Hub CIC and the Warwickshire Farm Management Group.\nPaul Rice, the firm\u2019s senior partner, who heads up the Wright Hassall agriculture team alongside partner, Alex Robinson, said: \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Joel, Vanessa and Jon.\nThe firm\u2019s annual agricultural conference will take place on December 5 and will bring together the team and a number of top speakers, including Adam Henson, whose Cotswold farm is home to many rare breeds and who is one of the BBC\u2019s lead presenters on Countryfile.", "Precinct 20 of the Eagle County Democratic Party participates in a straw poll between presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton at the caucus in Edwards on Tuesday.

But election years begin on a much more quiet note: county caucus meetings.\nCaucus meetings are relatively rare these days \u2014 they survive in only 16 states. But for almost as long as there have been political parties, those parties started election-year organizing the same way: with neighborhood get-togethers among party members. At those meetings, party members talk about the pros and cons of various candidates for office, and nominate delegates to county assemblies.\nAt those meetings, candidates are chosen for county-level elections. Delegates are also chosen for legislative district assemblies, as well as the state party conventions.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans follow the same caucus/assembly format. But there are differences, too.\nIn Eagle County, the local Democratic Party still holds several simultaneous meetings. The Republicans have consolidated its precinct meetings into just two locations: Battle Mountain High School for the Eagle River Valley and St. Peter\u2019s of the Valley Episcopal Church in Basalt.\nThe difference is a matter of philosophy.\nJoy Harrison is chairwoman of the county\u2019s Democratic Party. Harrison said party officials want to maintain a neighborhood feel to caucus night.\nEagle County Republican Party chairwoman Kaye Ferry said consolidated meetings seem to work better for those party members.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way better experience,\u201d Ferry said. \u201cPeople are excited to be the same room together.\nHowever the parties meet, there\u2019s a lot of work to do before the Nov. 6 general election, even in a year without a presidential vote.\nThe governor\u2019s seat is open, since current Gov.

Companies will also have to find a way to dispose of all the toxic wastewater or sludge that each well produces, since the closest landfill or industrial-waste facility that can handle the waste is hundreds of miles away.\n\u201cAround here, the rain comes on legs,\u201d said Chris Hayward, 51, a brawny, dust-covered farmer in Beaufort West, quoting a Karoo saying about how rare and fleeting precipitation is in the area.\nWith his three skinny border collies crouching dutifully at his side, Mr. Hayward explained that he had to slaughter more than 600 of his 2,000 sheep last year because there was not enough water to go around.\nSouth Africa is among the growing number of countries that want to unlock previously inaccessible natural gas reserves trapped in shale deep underground. The drilling technology \u2014 hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking,\u201d for short \u2014 holds the promise of generating new revenue through taxes on the gas, creating thousands of jobs for one of the country\u2019s poorest regions, and fueling power plants to provide electricity to roughly 10 million South Africans who live without it.\nBut many of the sites here and on other continents that are being considered for drilling by oil and gas companies and by governments short of cash are in fragile areas where local officials have limited resources, political leverage or experience to ensure that the drilling is done safely.\nThe interest from big energy companies in South Africa and elsewhere means that shale gas may redraw the global energy map, according to many energy experts.\nMichael Klare, a professor of world security studies at Hampshire College, said that the new sources of natural gas from shale may lessen the geopolitical importance of countries that historically have been the biggest producers of natural gas, including Iran, Qatar and Russia. The new drilling, which draws strong support from the United States government, represents a boon for American companies like Halliburton, Chesapeake Energy and Exxon Mobil that have greater experience with shale gas, and therefore are likely to win many lucrative contracts abroad.\nMore than 30 countries, including China, India and Pakistan, are now considering fracking for natural gas or oil, and the surge in gas production has spurred interest in building pipelines and terminals that liquefy the fuel so it can be shipped to far-flung markets. In the United States, shale gas has increased supply, driving prices down and benefiting industrial plants that use the gas for manufacturing and consumers who depend on it for electricity, heating or cooking.\nBut the enthusiasm abroad, especially in less-developed regions, does carry risks, according to many energy experts.\nThe Indonesian government, for example, is considering allowing drilling for shale gas in a part of Java where, in 2006, drilling led to the eruption of a mud volcano that killed at least 13 people, and displaced more than 30,000 residents from 12 villages, according to a team of international scientists. Indonesia is a major exporter of liquefied natural gas, but it struggles to meet domestic demand, and supporters of the shale drilling project say it will help solve that problem.\nShale gas in Poland may represent more than a third of the natural gas resources in Europe, according to energy experts, and could help the country reduce its dependence on Russia, which now supplies about 60 percent of Poland\u2019s gas.\nBut an April 2010 report by Bernstein Research, a market research group, raised concerns about the costs and risks of shale gas drilling because Poland is so densely populated, dependent on agriculture and farmers will have to compete with drillers for water.\n\u201cEurope and some of the countries with shale potential have significantly less renewable water resources than the U.S.,\u201d the report warned.\nIn the United States, where the water-intensive drilling technique of fracking was invented, the government is taking a lead role in supporting the dissemination of the technology abroad, as well as promoting other energy projects, including building infrastructure to extract and transport liquid natural gas.\nOver the past three years, President Obama has promoted shale gas during visits to China, India and Poland.\n\u201cWe believe that there is the capacity technologically to extract that gas in a way that is entirely safe,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a speech in May in Warsaw, where the American Embassy co-hosted an international shale gas conference.\nThe Export-Import Bank of the United States has financed some of its biggest gas projects over the last several years, including the largest transaction in the bank\u2019s history \u2014 $3 billion approved in 2009 for hundreds of miles of gas pipeline and a liquid natural gas plant and terminal project led by Exxon Mobil in Papua New Guinea.\nThe United States Geological Survey has offered training and technology to geologists exploring shale gas in Europe.\nIn 2009, the United States and China signed an agreement to promote accelerated development of shale gas in China, which has major shale gas deposits in Inner Mongolia in the north and in the country\u2019s restive western frontier, Xinjiang, which is characterized by severe droughts and a separatist movement.\nThe State Department\u2019s Global Shale Gas Initiative, begun in 2010, has been advising many foreign countries on fracking. It has organized a half-dozen trips this year for foreign officials to meet with American energy experts and to visit drilling sites in the United States.\nSome economists and environmentalists say that while the governments of poorer countries may benefit from the new tax revenues and jobs, they may not be paying enough attention to the environmental risks of drilling. They also note that local residents \u2014 who bear the brunt of the air pollution, potential water contamination from spills or underground seepage, and truck traffic that come with drilling \u2014 may see few benefits.\n\u201cThese projects have already started causing steep inflation in costs of local housing and services, and except for the lucky few who get temporary construction jobs, the economic conditions for local communities can actually get worse,\u201d said Doug Norlen, policy director of Pacific Environment, an advocacy and research organization that tracks federal and corporate financing of energy projects abroad.\nThe direct benefits of new drilling to American landowners \u2014 they receive bonuses and royalties when they lease their land to drillers \u2014 will generally not be shared by landowners abroad. In South Africa and many other countries looking to embrace the drilling, the minerals under a property are more often owned by governments, not individuals.\nMr. Norlen added that the influx of foreign construction workers in these projects could lead to conflicts with local and tribal communities. In one example, he noted, the United States government-financed project in Papua New Guinea to extract and transport liquid natural gas recently led to violent clashes between residents and foreign contractors.\nBut Jan Willem Eggink, general manager for Shell in South Africa, said that the Karoo project could eventually produce millions of dollars in direct investment and thousands of jobs for South Africans, which would help lower the nation\u2019s unemployment rate of about 25 percent.\n\u201cThere is a huge energy problem looming for South Africa,\u201d he added, explaining that energy demand is growing rapidly and that shale gas coupled with renewables could help meet that new demand while also lowering the nation\u2019s dependence on Mozambique for gas.\nFracking involves injecting large amounts of water mixed with chemicals and sand at very high pressure deep underground to crack rock and release gas. After fracking, much of the water at each well returns to the surface mixed with toxic chemicals.\nShell\u2019s plan is to drill at least six exploratory wells over the next three years, and if the gas reserves appear profitable, it will start production with at least 1,500 wells several years later. Martin Bell, the water manager for Shell\u2019s Karoo project, said the company planned to recycle as much wastewater as possible, storing it temporarily in closed containers. Trucks will not be the primary method for moving waste or water, he said. Drilling waste, which could be especially toxic because the area is high in uranium deposits, will be shipped to disposal plants by pipes or by rail, Mr. Bell said.\nWater needed for fracking may be brought in by rail from the coast, which is hundreds of miles away in some parts, or drawn from aquifers far below the ones that supply water for farmers. The company will tap into the aquifers that farmers use only if it can prove no adverse impact, Mr. Bell said.\nIn interviews, South African drilling regulators emphasized that producing and using more natural gas would help the country\u2019s air pollution problems and avoid increasing its already heavy dependence on coal for electricity, since coal is dirtier than natural gas when burned.\nBut in this sun-flooded hinterland, where sheep outnumber humans and rusty windmills pumping water dot the horizon, many residents say they would prefer to see the government bring in wind or solar farms, not new drilling.\n\u201cIt just takes one big spill, leaky pipe or crack underground that their studies didn\u2019t catch, and a farm my family has run for four generations is done,\u201d said Trenly Spence, 44, as he dug up a clogged irrigation pipe that carries water across his 3,300 acres to where his 3,000 sheep and goats graze.\nMr. Spence added that farmers had been frustrated by the lack of information from Shell officials about the chemicals they would inject into the ground during fracking.\nShell officials said that they would disclose what they could about fracking formulas if they started drilling, but that they might be limited by trade secrets of their subcontractors.\nIn the United States, some drilling companies have been reluctant to reveal the chemicals they use in fracking, saying the information is proprietary.\nOfficials from the State Department\u2019s shale gas initiative have said that developing countries interested in fracking will need to create stronger protections for intellectual property rights so energy companies will think that they can safely maintain certain patents over their drilling techniques. Some environmentalists say that strengthening these intellectual property protections will only help energy companies argue that they do not have to disclose the chemicals they use in fracking abroad.\nA spokesman for the State Department declined to answer questions about fracking and intellectual property rights. But he emphasized that the initiative\u2019s goal is to help countries make informed decisions about their resources, rather than promoting shale gas abroad.\nIn Peru, for example, the United States Export-Import bank provided more than $400 million in loan guarantees in 2008 for a liquefied natural gas terminal to export gas from the Camisea gas fields, which are in the Amazon rainforest. The project for drilling and pipelines in the Camisea, which received separate financing from the Inter-American Development Bank, has been dogged by spills, accusations that company officials bribed lawmakers and criticisms about exporting the gas rather than using more of it to lower prices for domestic consumers.\nEnergy companies are using fracking technology in parts of Canada, bringing jobs and wealth to gas-rich provinces like Alberta and British Columbia. But residents near drilling sites have complained that natural gas has seeped into their water wells making their tap water flammable. Drillers have denied responsibility.\nIn South Africa, pressure is mounting to proceed cautiously.\nAfter public concerns were raised this year about drilling in the Karoo region, South African drilling officials set a moratorium on new licenses for exploration until February so the government could conduct more research.\nIn July, the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa, an independent agency that sets guidelines for media companies, ruled that several of Shell\u2019s advertised claims \u2014 including one that said fracking had never led to groundwater contamination \u2014 were misleading or unsubstantiated and should be withdrawn. Shell said the advertisements were an accurate reflection of its opinion.", "221B Bakers Street is where it all started, a residence in Victorian England where the legendary and fictitious Sherlock Holmes speculated that more was \u201cafoot\u201d than met the eye in the seemingly random crime sprees happening around him.\nAs it would turn out in \u201cThe Final Problem,\u201d a criminal mastermind known as Professor Moriarty would not only be the puppeteer pulling the strings of crime behind the scenes, but he would also be able to match Sherlock Holmes in wit and intelligence and ultimately become his arch-enemy.\nProfessor Moriarty was eventually killed in the same story, as Moriarty and Holmes fell from Reichenbach Falls and both were presumed dead.\nHe is the \u201cNapoleon of Crime,\u201d as described by Holmes. As it turns out, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes series, pulled that phrase from a Scotland Yard inspector of the day who was referring to English aristocrat Adam Worth, according to Princeton University. Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind, was the inspiration for the Moriarty character.\nWorth had a network of criminal connections equal to or perhaps even greater than Moriarty. Considered a master thief, he stole his way through New York before jumping ship to England in 1869. By that time he had already committed 53,000 crimes leaving little to no evidence, according to The Smithsonian.\nUnlike Moriarty, he had a unique morality when committing crimes. He was opposed to hurting or killing anyone and even firmly instructed his henchmen to follow the same practice.\nWhen he made it to England, he transformed himself into an English Gentleman named Henry J. Raymond and blended in flawlessly with London\u2019s upper class. Behind the scenes, he built a criminal network stretching across continents.\nHis crimes stretched even as far as Port Elizabeth, South Africa, leaving police confused and at a loss for evidence.\nWorth\u2019s most remembered crime is probably the abduction of the famous portrait of 18th century Duchess of Devonshire Georgiana by Thomas Gainsborough in 1787. The portrait was much admired in its day when it disappeared from Agnew and Son London Gallery on the night of May 25, 1876. Worth held onto the painting for the next 25 years.\nWorth eventually got busted while committing a crime in Belgium in 1892. The robbery of an express carrier in Liege went wrong. He spent the next five years behind bars and lost everything, including his money and family, as a result. The painting was eventually given back to Agnew and Sons by Worth in 1901, which was arranged by the Pinkerton Detective Agency. Worth died the next year.\nAlthough Worth has been gone for over a century, the character of Professor Moriarty has lived in literature through the ages and the character dynamic between Holmes and Moriarty, hero and arch-enemy, continues to be a source of inspiration for stories today.\nSherlock Series 4: Premiere Date Not Until 2016, But Will a \u2018Special\u2019 Episode Air Before Season 4?", "I recently worked with Matt Starr, Spectra Logic\u2019s CTO and his staff to explore how much data is stored in the FIFA World Cup Matches. The digital storage requirements of live sports events are a big driver of media technology. These events use many cameras per game and eventually you may be able to enjoy your favorite live sports event in virtual reality\u2014looking at the amount of digital storage required for today\u2019s games can give us a taste of how much this could grow in the future.\nHere are some details. There were 64 total matches with 300 broadcasters showcasing live matches to 210 countries. In the months leading up to the World Cup, FIFA announced that this would be the first one to have all 64 matches shot in Ultra HD, with HDR to boot. 37 cameras covered every single match. From these 37, eight were shooting in UHD/4K format. Eight cameras were there to purely capture footage to be shown in super slow motion and two other cameras are ultra-motion cameras.\nManaging all these cameras requires an advanced networking setup. According to the SVG blog: The UHD/HDR efforts at the FIFA World Cup have two layers of production formats in use: a core layer comprises cameras operating in 1080p/50 SDR mode (REC.709) with HD graphics; an enhanced UHD layer operates at 2160p/50 HDR (BT2020) without graphics. The HDR production format is OETF Slog3/Live, and the UHD feed (available only at the International Broadcast Center) relies on quad 1080p/50 at 3 Gbps to create the 4K-resolution image.\nSpectra Logic calculated that the entire 2018 FIFA World Cup generated, at a minimum, 5.36 PB of raw video footage alone. This number considers only a single copy of the raw footage from each camera in each stadium, during the average 60 minutes of gameplay. Other footage generated from the games not included in Spectra\u2019s calculation includes additional coverage from news agencies, footage which includes overlays such as scores and times, or the multiple copies of the footage which will be created for archive purposes, not to mention all pre- and post-game footage and players or team feature footage. Below are details on this calculation.\nThe total storage requirements are probably significantly higher. All game broadcasts need to be redubbed in their native language (32 countries and 15 different languages). Using SMPTE\u2019s IMF standard for these dubs would save on digital storage requirements.\nMany fans will have captured photos and videos of the game, that will be stored in portals throughout the world, including in the cloud. Storage in the cloud will probably result in multiple copies of each video due to their data protection policies. If we assume that 80% of the stadium (45,000 seating capacity on average) are taking photos and videos and that each photo uses 20 MB and each video is 100 MB and that these active viewers take 1-20 photos and 1-5 videos, then each game could generate something like 14.6 TB. With 64 matches, that would generate about 934 TB (close to 1 PB) of consumer generated content for the tournament.\nBig sports events are attracting the latest technologies to give fans the ultimate sports experience, particularly for home viewers. Sophisticated viewing and ultimately VR viewing requires multiple high-resolution cameras. The 2018 World Cup may have generated over 6 PB of total content. Future sports events will require even more.", "Roisin Fitzgerald and Ciaran 'Dug' Doyle from Co. Wicklow first met on a night out Aughrim. The pair became friends, bumping into each other in their local Ballymanus and spending more and more time together until one night they sealed the deal with a kiss: \"it all went so smoothly from there and just felt right,\" recalls Roisin.\nAs far as popping the question goes, Ciaran played a blinder with his surprise proposal. The couple were painting the walls of their new house when he asked Roisin if she fancied taking a break by heading out on a bike ride, simple enough.\n\"I was reluctant at first as we had had a little bit of a tiff that morning but I knew he was quite eager and I didn't want to be stubborn so we headed out in Ballymanus. I was moaning at first saying things like 'why are we going this way, this hill is so hard'...but I then softened up with the beautiful scenery. He insisted we keep going and eventually we pulled in to a gorgeous view.\"\nAs soon they were off the bikes, Ciaran was down on one knee asking her to be his wife: \"we both laughed and cried together\". To top it off, Ciaran stealthily pulled out a bottle of champers and a pair of flutes he had hid in the bushes earlier that morning (remember that tiff they had earlier in the day?!) and the two shared a few sips before heading back to share the news: \"Dug still will not let me live it down how quick my little legs biked back to tell our good news to all our family and friends!\"\nThey tied the knot at Ballybeg House in June, their humanist ceremony officiated by celebrant Amy Brown. The day was inspired by the beautiful setting of Ballybeg, a venue Roisin says was \"everything I had wanted for a wedding.\"\nAs wedding dress shopping goes, Roisin's experience was as straight-forward as they come, and despite thinking it would take time to source a style that suited, she found 'the one' on her very first outing.\n\"Myself and my mam headed to The White Room in Mullingar for an appointment I assumed would just be to tease out what suited me and what didn't. I never in a million years thought I would get my dress on the first outing but that was it - one day, and the second dress I tried on I knew was the one for me.\"\nRoisin completed her look with a headpiece in Folkster in Kilkenny and a veil which she had shipped over from America. Her bridesmaids' dresses were from Jarlo London: \"I loved the bridesmaid dresses. The girls just looked amazing on the day.\"\nCiaran's groomsmen's suits were from Jack Dunne and Son in Gorey: \"We went there with the intention of renting the suits,\" explains the bride, \"but then of course I was taken with the more fitted suits that weren't available for hire!\n\"When Dug tried one on, it was like 'Yes, we have to have them'. They were so stylish and modern and the navy was to die for! As my Mam said, he would give Daniel Craig a run for his money.\"\nThe couple bought the groomsmen their suits as a gift - \"they did not complain!\"\nThe couple decided to visit Ballybeg House on recommendation from Roisin's mother, who had attended a wedding there and been very impressed. Owner Paddy O'Toole showed the couple around and they were instantly taken with the place.\nI have never got such a feeling when walking around Ballybeg as this is just everything I have ever wanted for a wedding and it was so us. I literally said I feel like I always wanted to get married here and I didn\u2019t even know it was here.\n\"When we entered the ceremony room I gasped. It literally took my breath away.\"\n\"By the end of the tour, we looked at each other before turning to Paddy to ask if he had our date. He laughed and said 'do you want to go away and think about it?' which we did, but we didn't look anywhere else. We knew this was the venue for us!\"\nThe couple's wedding theme was entirely inspired by their surroundings in Ballybeg, and they didn't feel the need to go overboard with decor for the day. Nevertheless they wanted to put their own stamp of things, and enjoyed bringing their ideas all together.\n\"To say we enjoyed the planning is an understatement,\" says Roisin, \"I just loved every minute of it.\n\"The wedding co-ordinator Tee is extraordinary to say the least. She told us we didn't have to buy anything extra, to leave it all to them, and it's like she takes on your vision and creates your day how you have always envisioned it.\nThe couple did add one or two extras to the day however, including a bubble machine which went down a treat with both the kids and the adults, and a fabulous fireworks display later in the night: \"One of my clients had told me that their uncle had fireworks at his wedding in Italy and my Ferrari brain immediately started racing. I went home to Dug with this idea, fully thinking that he would shoot me down and tell me where to go, but he thought it was a great idea so we ran with that and told no one. It was our little secret!\"\n\"This might sound soppy,\" Roisin says, \"but my favourite part of the day was how much fun myself and Dug had.\n\"I loved the morning with my mam and bridemaids. We were so relaxed - I started the day off in the hot tub! The ceremony was so special too - when I standing outside ready to go in, linked to my dad and Feels Like Home, our entrance song, came on, I started welling up. I looked over at dad and he was crying, we cried a little together. I will never forget that moment and that feeling of emotional love, nerves and excitement.\n\"Myself and Dug literally laughed all day and all weekend, surrounded by all our friends and family. We felt such love from all the people who came from abroad for our wedding and just laughed all day. That is what I will take from the weekend and will always remember.\"\nThe wedding was catered by Molly's Larder, the venue's preferred caterers: \"People could not stop talking about the food, myself included,\" says Roisin, \"they're still talking about our amazing black pudding starter.\"\n\"We felt like we were eating in Avoca, which makes sense as it turned out one of the head chefs was the head chef in Avoca - hence why it was tasted that good!\"\nThe couple brought in Adventure Catering to provide something a little different for the evening food. \"They were amazing and the food was so tasty,\" says Roisin. \"When the band went for their break we asked everyone to go outside. First they grabbed some rub from the food truck and then our fireworks started going off! The display was out of this world. It went down unbelievably well.\"\nRoisin's top planning advice for other couples? \"Do it together,\" she says. \"I loved how we planned our day and weekend together - it made it more 'our wedding'. We each had our strengths and weaknesses and we worked with that but there will never be a 'the man does nothing, he just turns up' stuff. Neither of us wanted that.\"\nRoisin and Ciaran will honeymoon in Thailand and Vietnam in early 2019. \"I initially decided to wait because of my business, but it has worked out so well that we now have that to look forward to,\" says Roisin. \"It's so exciting! It's not over yet!\"", "The latest twist in the Indian government\u2019s proposed acquisition of 36 Rafale fighter jets from French firm Dassault is more semantic than financial or technical. The negotiations were begun in the Congress-led regime, in 2012, when Dr Manmohan Singh was the prime minister.\nThere are three points about the $8.7 billion (Dh31.95 billion) deal which are made out to be objectionable. One is that the price of the individual planes shot up from Rs526 crore [Rs5.26 billion or] to Rs1,670 crore [Rs16.7 billion]. But as the former defence minister \u2014 now Goa chief minister \u2014 Manohar Parrikar said, the first price was a non-starter; Dassault was not interested because they found the quoted price too low. The question is: what might have been a more optimal price than the one the Indian defence ministry and Dassult finally hit upon in the fullness of the inflationary years? In short, how did they arrive at Rs1,670 crore as the price of one jet. That process is missing from the controversy, which is now threatening to be potentially explosive as the general elections approach.\nIt is likely that on Wednesday the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India will table in parliament its audit report of the major defence contracts including the Rafale deal. It is unlikely there will be any shattering revelations. In any case, the Modi government could on its own lay bare the method by which the parties arrived at this price, unless it is a state secret. If it is, then the real issue is what constitutes state secrets. And the debate might come across as more illuminating because it defines Parliament\u2019s remit once and for all.\nThe second point is the involvement of Anil Ambani, the chairman of Reliance group, and the brother of Mukesh Ambani. Anil Ambani was present when Modi went to France in 2015 to negotiate \u2014 among other things \u2014 the Dassault deal. The objection to the businessman\u2019s presence allegedly translated into a preferential treatment whose corporate manifestation was a joint venture company partnered by both Reliance and Dassault.\nThe formation of the new company meant the new entity would channelise nearly 50 per cent of the money transacted from the Rafale deal amounting \u2014 by one estimate \u2014 to nearly Rs30,000 crore [Rs300 billion]. This would be done through an \u2018offset\u2019 clause which in this case means Dassault is obligated to spend the money in value and worth in Indian army-managed R&D [research and development, and related private companies. Anil Ambani has said in this regard that other companies besides his will benefit from the offset clause.\nThe moot point though is whether the Modi government recommended Anil Ambani\u2019s name as the primary beneficiary. The opposition and the media \u2014 suddenly in the truth-to-power mode in the wake of the Rahul Gandhi-led Congress winning the recent state assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh \u2014 allege that he has been favoured. The point, however, is that anyone risks being called a \u2018crony capitalist\u2019 in this contest if, instead of Anil Ambani, someone else had been officially recommended.\nWhat might have done the larger good would be the demand for and detailing of the process by which private offset beneficiaries were finalised. Because, that benefit must go to someone. That the offset clause is good for India can\u2019t be reasonably doubted, and since the Modi government appears to have introduced it to the contract, that credit must accrue them.\nBut it is also clear from the notes that there was a prime minister-president channel of talks existing. If so, why should the PMO not hold \u2018parallel discussions\u2019? Nor is it clear from the versions antagonistic to the government narrative, why or how the defence ministry\u2019s chips would be greatly lowered if the PMO is lawfully part of the negotiations \u2014 provided the takeaway is transparent to all. If not, the semantic distinctions like \u2018parallel\u2019 or \u2018over reactions\u2019 do not mean much any way.\nWhat really queers the pitch for the Modi government is the presence of Anil Ambani, whom Rahul Gandhi specifically and the opposition generally sees as an anointed ambassador of crony capitalism. The Ambanis and the Adanis are visibly close to Modi. The Tatas, the Birlas and Dalmias were equally close the Nehru-Gandhi family. Crony capitalism has flourished in India.\nA few influential business families always benefit from their proximity to the powerful politicians of the moment. But, is the opposition looking for a structural change in the Indian economy rather than personally attacking the PM? For instance, the elimination of the middle men, cronies and rent seekers?\nIf so, they have a great metaphysical problem on their hands: how to fix the fix without fixers.", "Neighbors | Zack Shively.After the story time, the children could play games and make crafts in the meeting room.

MySpace will be introducing a feature that allows its remaining users to log on to the site with their Facebook IDs, hereby finally ceding the social networking crown to the reigning champ.\nThe new project, dubbed \"Mashup with Facebook,\" could help the newly redesigned MySpace by introducing its entertainment content to the huge user-base of Facebook. Mashable reports that MySpace will also be introducing \"like\" buttons to its content, \"meaning MySpace content like music and videos will start getting shared back to Facebook.\"\nYouRockRadio writes, \"Being in the music industry, I believed that MySpace missed the boat on their true calling years ago.

Facebook announced in February it has 400 million registered users, while MySpace had about 100 million users. MySpace also reported a $156 million loss last quarter.\nWill hitching its wagon to Facebook bring MySpace back from the brink of Web-death?

Several candidates, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have called it \u201cunrealistic,\u201d and Wisconsin Gov.

Not so fast without missing element of criminal intent Feds say marijuana ties could prevent immigrants from getting US citizenship Trump approval drops to 2019 low after Mueller report's release: poll MORE on Sunday slammed CBS's \"60 Minutes\" over an evening report about his administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy, which resulted in the separation of thousands of children from their parents at the southern border.\nThe \"60 Minutes\" report concluded that the Trump administration separated migrant children from their parents at the border for more time than most people realized, pursuing a \"pilot\" family separation program in 2017.\n\".@60Minutes did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\"In fact, a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad (cruel) we are, but it was in 2014 during O years,\" the president added, likely a reference to a 2014 photo that several media outlets and Democrats shared thinking they were taken in 2018.\nTrump has repeatedly asserted, misleadingly, that his administration's policy is the same as former President Obama's. While the Obama administration did separate some children from their parents at the border, it was not a \"zero tolerance\" policy and did not happen with the same frequency as it did under Trump.\nIn regards to the photo Trump referenced, Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, who served as the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, told NPR that it was taken at a time when there was \"an enormous spike ... in the number of kids crossing alone into the United States.\"\n\"Kids ended up piling up in Border Patrol lock-ups, which are no places for children,\" Mu\u00f1oz explained in May.\nTrump said that Obama, as well as former President George W. Bush, separated children from their parents because \"that is the policy and law.\" It was neither a policy nor a law under Trump's predecessors.\n\"I tried to keep them together but the problem is, when you do that, vast numbers of additional people storm the Border,\" Trump said. \"So with Obama seperation [sic] is fine, but with Trump it\u2019s not. Fake 60 Minutes!\"\nThe \"60 Minutes\" report included an interview with Scott Shuchart, a former senior adviser to the officer for civil rights and civil liberties at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Shuchart told CBS that the policy was pushed through from the top without insight from DHS officials.\n\"We were being asked as a department to do something that violated the civil rights and civil liberties of persons,\" Shuchart, who left the agency around the same time, said. \"And my office was being frozen out of that process. There wasn't a job responsibly for me to do.\"\nThe Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy resulted in more than 2,000 children being separated from their parents over the span of 11 weeks earlier this year. The policy led to a political firestorm, with activists and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle raging over images of children detained in filthy and bleak conditions.\nTrump signed an executive order ending the policy in June and federal judges mandated that children be returned to their parents.\n\"60 Minutes\" obtained a full memo that showed the goal of the family separations was to \"deter\" more immigrants from coming into the country. There is no evidence that the policy deterred immigration or brought down the number of people seeking to enter the U.S.\n--This report was updated on Nov. 26 at 8:59 a.m.", "The president of the Iowa Medical Society is in Chicago for the annual meeting of delegates of the American Medical Association. While physicians consider a long list of suggestions for their policies and positions, Iowa doctor Charles Helms practices medicine at University Hospitals in Iowa City. They range in topic from public-health issues to dollars-and-sense concerns of doctors who practice medicine, what he calls a \u201ctypical smorgasbord\u201d of ideas for the delegates to deliberate. Doctor Helms says about 250 resolutions have been submitted by the state associations and specialized societies that are members of the A-M-A. One resolution withdrawn by its sponsor would have let doctors refuse care to lawyers who sue doctors. Iowa\u2019s Doctor Helms says a couple interesting resolutions deal with public health.One\u2019s an \u201cinteresting\u201d resolution he says would require an \u201cR\u201d rating for any movie where people smoke tobacco, saying people should recognize that smoking is dangerous to their health. Many of the other resolutions revolve around what the doctor calls the \u201cepidemic of obesity\u201d among people in the United States. The Iowa M-D says doctors are talking about legislation that would set up a confidential reporting system to organize data on medical mistakes, instead of putting every doctor at risk of heavy penalties for admitting an error as he says the current system does. What we call \u201cblame and shame,\u201d oriented to target individuals who have accidents or make a mistake. Helms says as long as it isn\u2019t a true \u201ctort,\u201d the legal term for something done maliciously, he says finding out how such errors happen can improve the system to reduce the likelihood of such a mistake happening in the first place. As an example, the doctor says he could call up and tell of a mistake he\u2019d made, and by allowing it to become part of the patient-safety research, could help make all patients safer including his own. Iowa\u2019s physicians face a particular problem in the skyrocketing cost of the malpractice insurance they must have. Premiums for malpractice coverage are forcing doctors to restrict service they deliver, make them refer complex cases to other doctors, and mean there are fewer docs who handle the complex cases in hometowns, because of the liability issues. In Iowa, Helms says that means fewer doctors choosing to deliver babies, and serious concerns for the trauma centers that handle badly-injured patients.

For $60 each,\u201d the artist wrote in text intercut in the video.\nThe booth, which consisted of a table and folding fence, was set up off Fifth Avenue at Central Park South next to other art peddlers at around 11\u2009a.m. Saturday. Signs advertised nothing more than \u201cSpray Art\u201d for $60 \u2014 with no mention of the reclusive Banksy.\nThe elderly man went about four hours before making a sale.\nThe video shows him repeatedly yawning, eating lunch and otherwise looking bored as people strolled by without a second glance at the famous works.\nFinally, at 3:30 pm, the first two pieces sold.\n\u201cFirst sale. A lady buys two small canvases for her children. But only after negotiation a 50% discount,\u201d Banksy noted on the video.\nHalf an hour later, a New Zealand woman bought two of the pieces, paying $120, and earning a kiss from the man selling the art.\nThe stall minder hit the jackpot at around 5:30 p.m., when a man from Chicago stopped and said he was decorating his new house back home.\n\u201cI just need something for the walls,\u201d he told the salesman before buying four large canvases and getting a big hug in return.\nThat turned out to be the last sale of the day, and Banksy\u2019s street rep closed up shop around 6 p.m. with most of the pieces unsold.\nThe BBC estimated that the art pieces could be worth as much as $31,000 a piece.\nBut Banksy won\u2019t be repeating the stunt.\nWhile most pedestrians paid the sidewalk setup no mind, Christensen-Flowers actually derided the salesman when she walked by, assuming he was selling knockoffs.\n\u201cI know a fake Banksy when I see one \u2014 I thought,\u201d Christensen-Flowers wrote on NBC\u2019s Web site after learning each of the signed \u201cknockoffs\u201d was the genuine article.\nMeanwhile, the Craigslist buyer was still hoping for a bite from one of the buyers.\n\u201cI am simply a fan of his and in my late 20s, and not by any means part of the ultra-affluent crowd who his pieces usually end up with on the secondary market,\u201d he said.\nHe also commended Banksy for the pop-up stand idea.\n\u201cI believe that he had a very pure intentions in wanting his pieces going into the hands of everyday people, and this is a way of making that statement,\u201d he said.\nBanksy is in the middle of a monthlong \u201cresidency\u201d in New York, during which he has promised to complete a new work in the city and post it on his Web site.\nSome of Banksy\u2019s New York installations have included a slaughterhouse truck filled with stuffed animals touring the Meatpacking District, a concrete \u201cconfessional\u201d on cement slabs in Manhattan, a beaver stenciled into a Brooklyn wall and a depiction of war horses sporting goggles behind a chain link fence on Ludlow Street.", "The claims costs connected to the recent half billion egg recall will be unprecedented and include liabilities such as business interruption and reputation damage. During the next 15 months, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will inspect the 600 largest egg production facilities, in response to the recall. From pet food to tomatoes, the frequency and severity of food recalls are increasing, prompting greater awareness among food system, agribusiness and beverage companies to insure against such events.\nAon Risk Solutions, the global risk management business of Aon, recently released its 2010 Food System, Agribusiness and Beverage report, which highlighted the need for food system, agribusiness and beverage companies to reduce volatility in revenue, stabilize earnings and control pre-loss and post-loss risk exposures in today\u2019s global marketplace. The report findings will enable organizations to benchmark their risk management and risk financing practices against those of their peers.\nMany consumer-facing organizations overlook the impact suppliers may have on their public reputations. Recent financial security risk assessments conducted by Aon\u2019s Food System, Agribusiness and Beverage practice indicate that many suppliers\u2019 insurance programs will not respond effectively to significant contamination events. In addition, the vast majority of ingredient suppliers and importers have no coverage for their legal liabilities should a customer suffer a business interruption or reputation loss caused by a contaminated ingredient.\nMost companies have coverage for bodily injuries associated with a contaminated food, but the majority do not have coverage for the resulting loss of revenue caused by loss of consumer trust, damage to brand name or additional expenses associated with product contamination and recall.\nPre-incident Planning: The first step in managing the risk of food contamination incidents is proper advance planning. Every company should have a well-documented and practiced product recall or retrieval plan, with a clear chain of command and communication. No amount of insurance can replace customer confidence lost due to poor planning and/or execution of a crisis or recall.\nCrisis Management Planning: An appropriate crisis program goes beyond the pre-incident plan to coordinate all activities associated with a crisis.

It also offers unusually detailed sea-level rise predictions for every region of the United States.\nThe special report is the product of years of work by more than two dozen authors, who are drawn from NASA, NOAA, the Naval Postgraduate School, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Columbia University, Texas Tech University, and other institutions. The National Academy of Sciences also created a new editorial-review board explicitly for the purpose of reviewing this report.\nThis summer, some environmental groups said they feared that the Trump administration might seek to delay or alter the report in the final approval process, either by explicitly delaying its release or waylaying its completion by raising extraneous questions.\nAccording to some of the study\u2019s authors, there is little evidence of that happening. The vast majority of the federal government\u2019s final comments about the Climate Science Special Report were standard, they say, and in line with the kind of issues raised by agencies in previous presidential administrations.\n\u201cIt appears we continue to be on track for publication at the beginning of November. The comments received so far have been productive comments, consistent with previous interagency comments in December and May,\u201d said Robert Kopp, a coauthor of the report and the director of the Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Rutgers University.\nIn early August, The New York Times reported that some government scientists worried the Trump administration would try to suppress the long-planned report. That story generated its own mini-kerfuffle: The Times published a draft version of the special report that it said it had obtained exclusively; in fact, that same draft version was already freely available on the Internet Archive.\nThe Times later corrected its original story. It also posted an updated draft version of the Climate Science Special Report, which was an exclusive.\nIn the days after its story, Sarah Huckabee Sanders slammed the Times for the story. Scott Pruitt, the administration of the Environmental Protection Agency, also told a Texas radio show that he would now review the report before its publication.\nEventually, this year\u2019s report will inform the Fourth National Climate Assessment, which is due to come out in 2018. National Climate Assessments are supposed to turn climate science into usable policy information for state and local officials. Though the Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates that those assessments should come out every four years, only three have ever been released.\nIn August, the federal government disbanded a 15-person scientific review board meant to help write a new climate assessment and convert the Climate Science Special Report into concrete policy.\nEarlier this year, Pruitt questioned a bedrock finding of climate science when he doubted that carbon dioxide, emitted by human industrial activity, has warmed Earth\u2019s climate. He will not find solace in this report, which summarizes the findings of hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific papers published in journals like Nature, Science, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "The White House is set to announce on Tuesday that active duty troops deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border will be granted new authorities that allow them to protect Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel from a threat, according to a U.S. official.\nCurrently, the 5,900 troops on the southern border can act in self-defense, but do not have the authority to intervene if CBP personnel were overwhelmed by migrants.\nCNN was first to report about the additional authorities.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not confirm the expected White House announcement but stressed in a statement the importance of personnel safety.\nThree thousand migrants, mostly escaping violence and poverty in Central America, have poured into Tijuana in recent days, according to the Associated Press.\nThe U.S. port of entry across from Tijuana in San Ysidro, Calif., was closed for three hours early Monday after immigration authorities said they had received reports that members of a migrant caravan were gathering in Tijuana and planned to \"rush\" the border.\nCBP closed northbound lanes towards the nation's busiest border crossing, while military troops worked to install items like \"jersey barriers and concertina wire,\" CBP said. According to a DHS official, the suspension of the port also allowed CBP to move additional personnel to the area.\nHowever, it turned out to be a false alarm with CBP saying no migrants ever arrived.\nThe new authorities come as Defense Secretary James Mattis had earlier rejected a CBP request that would have allowed troops to perform activities like crowd control and riot control because the Pentagon considered them to be law enforcement.\nActive duty troops are prohibited by federal law from performing law enforcement activities unless specifically ordered by Congress or the president.\nTroops are currently scheduled to deploy to the border through Dec. 15 unless the Pentagon is \"directed otherwise,\" Department of Defense spokesperson Col. Rob Manning told reporters on Monday.\n\"And at some point in time when the work is done, we'll start downsizing capability or shift capability elsewhere on the border,\" Manning said, adding that the troop presence would fall in line with requests from CBP and DHS.\nThe Pentagon has yet to provide an official cost estimate for the deployment.\nABC News' Jack Date contributed to this report.", "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Whether felons who\u2019ve completed their time behind bars or on probation should have their voting rights restored if they haven\u2019t paid off all of their financial obligations has become a flashpoint as lawmakers grapple with carrying out a November constitutional amendment.\nRep. James Grant, R-Tampa, has crafted a bill that\u2019s shot him into the national spotlight, infuriated advocates of the amendment and spawned hundreds of phone calls and emails to legislators urging them to kill the proposal.\nGrant\u2019s definition of what it means to have completed sentences has created the firestorm.\nUnder the House proposal (HB 7089), felons would have to pay all court fees, fines and restitution to be eligible for the \u201cautomatic\u201d vote restoration.\nUnder current law, felons on probation must also reimburse the state for the costs of supervision, which could include fees for electronic monitoring or drug tests. Failure to pay those fees could result in revocation of probation, or the Department of Corrections could waive the fees, according to a staff analysis of the bill.\nThe House proposal defines \u201cterm of sentence\u201d as including \u201cany cost of supervision or other monetary obligation,\u201d a sticking point for proponents of the amendment.\n\u201cIf it is in the four corners of the sentence, it is the sentence,\u201d Grant told the House State Affairs Committee prior to a party-line, 15-6 vote Tuesday on the bill.\nThe House measure would also require full payment of restitution or other financial obligations that have been converted to civil judgments, another point of contention for proponents of the amendment.\nCecile Scoon, a lawyer and an officer with the League of Women Voters of Florida, argued that the House measure would also allow state agencies, such as the Department of Corrections, to levy fines against felons, which they would have to pay to be eligible for the automatic vote restoration. That\u2019s not what voters who supported the amendment envisioned, she said.\n\u201cThis is why people are offended. This is redefining what is Amendment 4 and going well outside what was said when the people voted,\u201d Scoon said.\nThe House has relied heavily on the words of the amendment backers, who have said in court and on the internet that a sentence includes fees, fines and restitution ordered by a judge.\nProponents of the measure maintain the amendment is self-executing - that it doesn\u2019t need legislation to be carried out. But if the Legislature insists on acting, they\u2019re asking lawmakers to rely on standards the state clemency board uses when considering restoration of voting rights, which exclude certain financial obligations such as court costs, fines and fees.\nNeal Volz, the political director of one of the committees behind the amendment, told the House panel that \u201cvoters wanted to expand democracy\u201d by adopting the measure.\nBut Grant, who pounded the podium at times during Thursday\u2019s discussion of the measure, suggested the amendment\u2019s supporters were pulling an \u201cambush\u201d on voters, by changing their positions on what it means for a sentence to be complete.\nOthers stressed how participating in elections helps felons who\u2019ve been released from prison or probation be integrated into their communities.\n\u201cWhen you are free from confinement, you must be free for the opportunity to vote. If not, you are still confined, just not between prison walls,\u201d Rep. Clovis Watson, D-Alachua, said.\nLance Wissinger, a convicted felon, said the House plan creates two classes of felons.\n\u201cWhat we are doing right now with the bill seems like it is targeting a certain demographic. It seems like it is going after people with low income, and it\u2019s not giving everyone the opportunity to have their ability to vote back,\u201d Wissinger said.\nGrant, however, argued that the Legislature is duty-bound to implement the amendment, as written.", "Music lovers are being invited to nominate their favourite songs or ballads for the first-ever EU songbook.\nHowever, hits such as U2\u2019s \u2019Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For\u2019, Van Morrison\u2019s \u2018Brown Eyed Girl\u2019, and the Cranberries\u2019 \u2019Zombie\u2019 do not feature.\nSongwriter Pete St John\u2019s \u2019The Fields of Athenry\u2019 and Derryman Phil Coulter\u2019s \u2019The Town I Love So Well\u2019 are in the mix.\n\u2019A Nation Once Again\u2019, \u2019Danny Boy\u2019, \u2019Si\u00fail A R\u00fan\u2019, \u2019Boolavogue\u2019, \u2019Molly Malone\u2019 and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada\u2019s \u2019\u00c1r n\u00c1thair\u2019 were all forwarded for selection.\nA total of 56 songs were nominated in six categories by students and teachers from Irish music academies, along with choir associations.\nIn Britain, the Beatles dominated the UK selection with McCartney/Lennon\u2019s lyrics for \u2019All You Need is Love\u2019, \u2019She Loves You\u2019, and \u2019Imagine\u2019 featuring along with \u2019Auld Lang Syne\u2019, \u2019Jerusalem\u2019, and children\u2019s song \u2019Oranges and Lemons\u2019.\nHowever, there is a possibility with the songbook being published post-Brexit, old acquaintances may be forgotten with the UK being just an appendage to the publication.\nDenmark-based Jeppe Marsiling said the book is not an EU initiative and has no financial ties with the EU.\n\u201cI was surprised Bono and his band are not included in the selection lists for Ireland but, in my opinion, Ireland has a deep treasure of songs and I was pleased to see the Gaelic influences on its music,\u201d said Mr Marsiling.\nSignificantly, 21 of the submissions from Ireland were in Irish and the remainder with lyrics in English.\nThe EU songbook editor for Ireland is Maria Judge, head of musicianship and academic studies at CIT Cork School of Music.\nShe did not personally nominate any songs but believes that the selection list \u201coffers the opportunity to the public to vote for songs, in each category, felt to be most representative of our national character\u201d.\nHaving authenticated the songwriters credited with the lyrics submitted, Ms Judge said it was touching how people such as Presbyterian ministers who arrived and settled in Ireland wrote and helped to influence the creation of many folk songs.\nMs Judge said she is satisfied that \u201cour rich heritage is reflected in the variety of style and function of the songs nominated\u201d.\nThe inaugural songbook will have a total selection of 168, all translated into the English language but songs will also be published in the mother tongues of 24 states.", "The Supreme Court on Monday sought an explanation from Congress president Rahul Gandhi for \"incorrectly attributing\" to the top court that it had said \"Chowkidar Narendra Modi Chor hai.

Not true.\nA new study from Cornell University\u2019s Food and Brand Lab reveals that whenever adults serve themselves food, on average, they eat 92% of what they put on their plate, regardless of nationality, dining setting, and a host of other factors.\n\u201cIf you put it on your plate, it\u2019s going in your stomach,\u201d writes one of the authors, Brian Wansink, director of the lab.\nIf you put it on your plate, it\u2019s going in your stomach.\nIt\u2019s good news in the sense that maybe we really do have a better idea of how much we want to eat than we think. But it also means that subtle factors influencing how much we put on our plates in the first place\u2013such as larger serving spoons and plates\u2013can really influence how much we consume. After observing 1,179 diners from the U.S., Canada, France, Taiwan, Korea, Finland, and the Netherlands, they found that the results were pretty identical across different nationalities and genders.\nThere were several interesting subtleties to the data. The average child ate only about 59% of the food they self-served, a lot less than adults, probably because they gave themselves too much. And people ate more of their food (97%) when they were focused on eating, as opposed to when they were distracted and only cleaned about 88% of their plates. People also ate more of their meals (93%) than their snacks (76%).\nThe researchers, writing in the International Journal of Obesity, say the study will help buttress the findings of many other studies in nutrition, psychology, and consumer marketing that analyze how much food people serve themselves, but not how much people actually eat. This study shows that the two are pretty closely related.\nKeep this food for thought in mind next time you visit the buffet.", "Watching a movie at home on your TV or home theater PC is a simple affair: Insert the disc or open the file, and you're ready to go.

The Conservation Commission\u2019s assessment, therefore, has the power to stop the project or greenlight it to the Planning and Zoning Commission for final review.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking obviously at what, if any, impact there is to wetlands and watercourses. That is our purvey. We look at things like water quality, sediment and erosion control, repairing, buffers, flooding, drainage, and grating,\u201d Mozian said.\nMorningside\u2019s lawyer, Hartford-based attorney David S. Hoopes, said he believes the commission should approve the application because a number of engineers and soil scientists who have testified before the group say the project will not harm the wetlands whatsoever.\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually going to improve the flooding situation rather than worsen it, and that is really not subject to scientific debate,\u201d Hoopes said.\nA group of seven Westport residents who live near the proposed project, meanwhile, disagree with Hoopes and have filed as intervenors in the case under the Connecticut Environmental Protection Act.\nThe intervenors even hired their own lawyer, Bridgeport-based attorney Patricia Sullivan, who did not respond to call for comment, in addition to outside experts to testify about the project\u2019s impact on the wetlands.\n\u201cThis whole area is overflooding with so much construction that these people are trying to really build on top of wetlands. Flooding is a big concern,\u201d said Aurea de Souza, one of the residents listed in the intervenor case.\nThe Morningside application will next come before the Conservation Commission on May 9.", "What kind of a leader are you?\nThe most painful leadership book I've ever read is the new bestseller Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter by Liz Wiseman and Greg Mckeown.\nIt raises a fundamental question about leadership, one that has been waiting to be named, explored, and finally addressed: As a leader, are you a multiplier or a diminisher?\nIn asking the question, Wiseman and Mckeown have created a new set of terms that will be with us for a very long time affecting millions.\nTheir premise is that you're either a leader who causes everyone around you to feel and actually become smarter (multiplier) or you're one who causes everyone around you to feel and become dumber (diminisher).\nIt gets to the crux of leadership \u2014 especially now that companies rely on the brains of their employees, not their backs, to stay competitive.\nThe authors ask another important question: \"Are you a genius or a genius maker?\" Do you need to be the one in the room seen as having all the answers or do you draw out the genius that's within others in solving many of the complex problems facing business today?\nStephen Covey, of Seven Habits fame, makes it clear why genius makers have an edge today when he quotes management icon Peter Drucker in the foreword. Drucker notes that management in the 20th century increased the productivity of manual labour in factories 50-fold.\nThat was essential at a time when our economy depended more on manufacturing. \"The most important contribution management needs to make in the 21st century is similarly to increase the productivity of knowledge work and the knowledge worker,\" he said.\nMultipliers do this. Wiseman and Mckeown's research found that multipliers get 2.1 times more capability from their workers than diminishers. Factor in the five to ten per cent annual growth bonus they estimate because these same workers are getting smarter and more capable working for a multiplier and you get the kinds of knowledge worker productivity Drucker exclaimed is needed this century.\nThese same multiplier effects extend to the family. Wiseman and Mckeown share the results from several studies showing how the environment parents create has a direct impact on a child's IQ.\nOne specific change my wife and I made, after reading Multipliers, is to avoid praising our children for their intelligence and results. For instance, we've stopped saying, \"You're so good at math.\"\nThe research shows that this actually decreases kids' confidence as they face tougher problems since they don't want to disappoint their parents. In many cases, they will simply avoid math altogether when the going gets tough, rather than risk looking dumb.\nInstead, the research suggests it's better to praise children's hard work and effort. You might say \"I appreciate the effort you're making with these math problems.\" This approach increases their ability to reason and to solve more difficult problems. And it creates a belief, and then a reality, that grows their confidence and intelligence.\nSo it's not that diminishers are necessarily mean-spirited or bad people (whew!) \u2014 it's just that they don't fully understand how their words and approaches sap energy and intelligence from their families and associates. And it's a continuum, with most of us falling somewhere in between the extremes.\nThe bulk of Wiseman and Mckeown's book focuses on how to become more of a multiplier, offering concrete how-to advice on attitudinal and behavioural changes. It starts with changing your assumptions about others as a leader.\nDiminishers basically believe their people \"will never figure this out without me\" and tend to \"use, blame, tell, dictate, and control people,\" according to the authors.\nMultipliers, in turn, believe their people \"are smart and will figure this out\" and tend to \"develop, explore, challenge, consult, and support people.\" In essence, diminishers micromanage their people; multipliers invest in their people.\nIt's no accident that some managers are multipliers. Wiseman and Mckeown frame five disciplines that help them succeed.\nSo multipliers aren't wimps. They demand and receive outstanding results from their people. It's how you go about it that matters. Read the book and start making changes.\nIt wasn't lost on me that the lead author of this important book is a woman, a rarity among business bestsellers. My latest glance at the Top 100 business books on Amazon found just five women authors, only two of whom received top billing on the covers.\nThat's equal to the number of dead authors among the Top 100 business books! In a future column I might explore the reasons for this dearth of women wordsmiths.\nFor now, I'm just happy this book has been written, helping to usher in a decade focused less on stuff and more on people \u2014 and doing what we can as leaders to bring out the best in the people we touch at home and at work.\nVerne Harnish is author of Mastering the Rockefeller Habits and founder and CEO of Gazelles Inc, which serves as an outsourced corporate university boasting a faculty of well-known business experts.

Turkish courts have ordered their detention on suspicion of illegal entry and attempted military espionage.\nAnkara should, as a gesture of good will, release two Greek soldiers who were detained after crossing the border into Turkey on March 1, Tsipras told a meeting of his cabinet.\n\u201cIt is unfair that they are being held. Just as we, in the past, returned Turkish soldiers who may have crossed the Greek border by a few meters, I expect the Turkish president to today do the same,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe judicial process should be expedited to allow these two officers, who did nothing more than their duty, to come home,\u201d he added.\nTurkey criticized a Greek Prime Ministry statement on April 2 regarding the two soldiers.\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the rhetoric in the press statement issued on April 1 demonstrates that the Greek authorities have started to increasingly lower the level of discourse against Ankara.\n\u201cThese remarks, which are not in line with governmental responsibility, cause great concern,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cBut when it does not, Greece has no qualms about totally disregarding this principle by not even implementing international courts\u2019 verdicts. Recent history reveals this,\u201d the statement said.\nSeparately, a Greek court rejected on April 3 Turkey\u2019s extradition request for a member of the outlawed far-leftist Revolutionary People\u2019s Liberation Army-Front (DHKP-C), according to Greek ANA-MPA news agency.\nAli Ercan G\u00f6ko\u011flu of the DHKP-C was arrested last November in Athens and has since been jailed pending trial.\nG\u00f6ko\u011flu\u2019s arrest, along with eight others, came days before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan arrived in Athens for an official visit.\nBefore the decision of the Larissa Appeals Court on G\u00f6ko\u011flu, the prosecution argued that the suspect should not be extradited because \u201cthere is no guarantee for a fair trial,\u201d if returned to Turkey, it was reported.\nThe Greek Appeals Courts also previously denied extradition requests for four other DHKP-C members: Hasan Biber, Hazal Se\u00e7er, Mehmet Do\u011fan, and \u015eadi Naci \u00d6zpolat.\nTurkey\u2019s unfulfilled extradition demands for suspects of the July 2016 coup attempt is another issue of tension between the two neighbors.\nA Greek appeals court on March 16 rejected a Turkish demand for the handover of eight Turkish soldiers accused of having a direct role the failed coup.\nThe ruling marked the third extradition request that the Greek courts have refused, in an issue that has strained relations between the two NATO allies.", "Dubai: Three long days passed before anyone knew that Maria Fortaliza was trapped without food, water or any means of contact in the elevator of an Upper East Side Manhattan townhouse. Her unlikely saviour? A determined courier agent.\nOn Monday morning, a courier agent called the homeowner of the 65th East Street townhouse, unable to find someone to receive a delivery. He was directed to contact another family member based in New York City. The relative arrived and let the agent into the house when they noticed that the elevator was jammed, according to local news website abc7ny.com. They immediately alerted the emergency services.\nFirefighters forced open the elevator and found the 53-year-old housekeeper trapped between the second and third floors. Fortaliza made it out relatively stable despite being trapped in the building since Friday.\nThe townhouse is owned by American investment banker Warren A. Stephens and his wife, Harriet Stephens. In a statement to NBC 4 New York on Monday, a company spokesperson for Stephens said that they were grateful the employee of over 18 years was now safe. \u201cA Stephens family member accompanied her to the hospital this morning and remains at her side. The cause of this unfortunate incident is being investigated and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that something like this never happens again.\u201d they said.\nMany social media users expressed sympathy for the woman\u2019s experience.\nOthers raised questions about laws surrounding building safety.\nIn a report by NBC 4 New York according to the Department of Buildings (DOB), elevators in buildings without an attendant available during emergencies, are required to have an emergency button, a phone for communication or a signaling service. They reported that according to city records, the elevator was inspected in July 2018 with no violations filed. However, on the day of Fortaliza\u2019s rescue, the DOB issued a violation notice to the homeowners after someone refused to provide access to inspectors according to ABC News.", "HTC is in a difficult position. Last year, the company completely rebooted its Android range with the One series, an initial trio of handsets that looked beautiful, offered impressive hardware specs and hit the low, middle and high-end markets respectively.\nIt wasn\u2019t successful though. HTC\u2019s flagship device, the One X, went head-to-head with the Samsung Galaxy S III and lost. The smartphone was lovely to look at, had fantastic build quality and a more bearable version of its custom Android skin, HTC Sense. It couldn\u2019t compete with Samsung\u2019s collossal marketing budget though. Backed by an almost endless deluge of TV, magazine and billboard advertisements, the Galaxy S III persevered as the dominant handset.\nThe launch of the HTC One represents round two. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher; earlier this month, the company reported revenue of just $384 million, a frightening 44 percent drop on the year before. Last night, Samsung unveiled the new Galaxy S4. There\u2019s no room for error.\nThe game plan this year appears to be the same as last time though. The new HTC One has a gorgeous industrial design, coupled with competitive specs and a new iteration of its Sense skin. Fearing that a spec bump won\u2019t be enough to topple the Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC has opted to differentiate itself with two peculiar design decisions too; a new 4-megapixel camera and a home screen resembling Flipboard.\nHTC has an impressive track record of building smartphones with impeccable hardware aesthetics. The HTC One is no different, sporting two slick aluminium plates and a white plastic ridge running around the side. The 4.7-inch display has a noticeably thin black border which stretches to either side of the device, imitating an edge-to-edge screen when it\u2019s asleep or turned off.\nTwo speaker grills sit at the top and bottom of the device, giving the HTC One a unique but somehow familiar look. In the run-up to its reveal, plenty of people were comparing HTC\u2019s device to the iPhone 5, and although those thoughts aren\u2019t unfounded, it does feel markedly different.\nHTC\u2019s own design cues are accentuated on the back, for example, where the body arcs ever-so slightly. Two white strips of plastic top and tail the device, with the higher one trailing down to the new camera. The HTC and Beats Audio logos are ever present, but they feel subtle and not at all overbearing.\nAs with the One X, the HTC One is a fairly large smartphone. Anyone with small hands will struggle to tap the top-right corner of the screen without readjusting their grip or switching to a two-handed setup. Having said that, the device is astoundingly comfortable to hold. The curved back and aluminium materials give it a near-perfect feel that has been missing from recent handsets.\nThe power button is a little too flush with the top of the devices; there\u2019s very little feedback and if you\u2019re not looking at it directly, it can be difficult to know if the handset has actually switched on. Likewise, the volume rocker on the right-hand side feels too inconspicuous and can be difficult to locate by feel.\nThe One X had a brilliant display but the One surpasses it in almost every way. The 4.7-inch, 1920\u00d71080 screen is sublime, particularly with the screen brightness set to maximum.\nColor representation is fantastic, with deep blacks and super sharp text. Viewing angles are excellent indoors, although be warned that like every other smartphone in existence, it can be difficult to look at in direct sunlight. One day the industry will figure out how to solve this problem (e-ink aside) but for now we all just have to make do.\nThe 1080p screen is particularly impressive for watching movies and playing high-resolution video games such as Real Racing 3.\nThe speakers are also very impressive \u2013 some of the best I\u2019ve found on a smartphone actually \u2013 and benefit from the Beats Audio integration. HTC has coined this new setup BoomSound, which is a terrible name but a sensible approach to audio. The impact that the twin speakers have, particularly in their ability to handle stereo sound, simply can\u2019t be underestimated. Tinny and distant music is no longer an issue \u2013 this is audio you can truly appreciate without headphones.\nHTC has opted for Qualcomm\u2019s 1.7GHz quad-core Snapdragon 600 processor, coupled with 2GB of DDR2 RAM and 32GB of internal storage.\nThe result is staggering. Moving around the various menus and switching between multiple apps is near-instantaneous. Regardless of what you throw at it \u2013 be it high-end video games or advanced photo-editing software \u2013 the HTC One can handle it with ease.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the handset is LTE-enabled, so unlike the Nexus 4, it can handle 4G Internet connectivity no problem.\nAll of this takes a hit on the 2,300 mAh Li-Po battery though. It\u2019s hardly uncommon for smartphones, but all that power means that the HTC One can just about manage a full day on a single charge.\nMileage will vary, of course, depending on how much you use the device on any given day, as well as what you\u2019re doing with it. In day-to-day use though, I found myself putting the charger in my backpack just in case. Ultimately, this is the trade-off consumers will have to deal with as the industry pursues increasingly thinner and more powerful smartphones. C\u2019est la vie.\nEvery year, consumers yearn for a better version of Sense, the company\u2019s custom skin for Android. Ever since the Nexus line was introduced, the general consensus has been that if OEMs can leave stock Android alone, they should.\nThe new iteration, Sense 5, runs on Android 4.1.2 and takes this to heart. It\u2019s a shame that HTC wasn\u2019t able to develop on version 4.2, although the few absent features are soon forgotten among HTC\u2019s more jarring additions.\nThe biggest change by far is BlinkFeed. It\u2019s an entirely new experience for the home screen which swaps out the usual app icons and widgets in favour of tiled content pulled from the Web.\nThe premise is sound. Windows Phone 8, for example, does a great job of making the home screen feel more relative and interactive, thanks to its abundance of differently sized live tiles. Rather like Flipboard, already available on Android, HTC has tried to mimic this with its own news reader.\nThe execution is poor though. To start with, there\u2019s only a limited number of publications that you can feature in the feed; The Guardian, The Independent and Reuters make an appearance in the UK, as well as Clash and Mobo for music, but otherwise it\u2019s pretty barren.\nUsers can subscribe to other news categories, such as Business, Design and Travel, but there\u2019s no way of choosing custom RSS feeds, blogs or news outlets.\nThe caveat is that updates from Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and LinkedIn can be pulled in to occupy the remaining tiles. So a custom RSS feed, of sorts, could be created using a dedicated Twitter feed, but that would be avoiding the bigger problem; BlinkFeed is restrictive and underdeveloped.\nScrolling through the home screen is pleasant enough and the articles themselves are displayed with a clean, but basic design. Another issue is that many of the photographs appear pixellated or out-of-focus. It\u2019s unclear whether this is a problem with the service, or the content it\u2019s pulling in, but it means that BlinkFeed fails to achieve the glossy, magazine-style finish it so desperately strives for.\nThankfully, HTC has given users the option to choose another panel as the home screen. In this manner BlinkFeed can be ignored entirely, but it\u2019s just a shame to see a feature that HTC has clearly spent some time on go to waste.\nIn general, Sense 5 is a nice skin for Android. The app switcher, which is accessed now by double-tapping the home button, is a huge improvement over the 3D monstrosity featured in the One XL. The screen now shows nine tiles in a flat, 2D environment which involves next to no swiping or additional navigation.\nIn other places though, Sense still feels like a burden. The People app, for example, applies a filter made up of large, circular dots for almost every profile image. It looks positively bizarre, as if the person in your phonebook is actually a wanted criminal. There\u2019s also a plethora of different ways to navigate through the app, including swipes, taps and long-presses, which ultimately just feels tiring and overbearing.\nThe TV app, meanwhile, is a nice idea that ultimately lacks the functionality needed to succeed. The LG television in my apartment, for example, requires a \u201cGuide\u201d button to navigate through the various channels. Despite multiple attempts to remap the control scheme, HTC\u2019s app was unable to replicate this.\nIt\u2019s not all bad though. HTC\u2019s pre-installed music app feels much cleaner than Play Music, with a simple charcoal background and large, easy-to-use controls.\nThe Gallery app has also been greatly improved, adopting HTC\u2019s BlinkFeed layout for a better spaced and dynamic viewing experience. None of it is bad, per se, but you always have the feeling that there\u2019s a better third-party alternative waiting in the Play Store.\nIn recent years, smartphones have opted for image sensors with an increasingly large number of megapixels. The reason being that when an average consumer walks into a store, they\u2019re far more likely to pick the device with a higher number.\nSpeak to anyone with a passion for photography though, and they\u2019ll tell you that this isn\u2019t always the case. A range of different factors come into play, including image sensor size and lens quality.\nHTC has opted for a 4-megapixel shooter this time around, although to compensate it\u2019s been branded an \u201cUltraPixel\u201d camera (again, a pretty terrible marketing term).\nThe choice sounds like suicide for in-store sales, but HTC is desperately trying to hammer home the message that this is a superior offering for smartphone photographers. The idea is that with less pixels on the sensor, they can be larger and attract a greater amount of light, improving low-light images and overall noise.\nThe results, however, are mixed. Night-time shots benefit from better exposures, and in general have better contrast and color representation. Unfortunately, almost every photo looks a little dull and out-of-focus. The detail is there, but nothing looks as sharp or crisp as it should, resulting in photos that just don\u2019t stack up against the competition.\nHTC\u2019s new Zoe feature is worth mentioning, although in all honesty, it\u2019s not going to revolutionize smartphone photography. In a nutshell, it records four seconds of video \u2013 one before you press the shutter and three after \u2013 as well as a series of stills simultaneously. As with Time Shift on the BlackBerry Z10, this allows you to go back and forth through the video and pick out any moment as a fully-realized photograph.\nZoes can also be uploaded to social networks such as Facebook, as well as the company\u2019s own HTC Share service. It\u2019s a little like Vine, although the four second restriction makes it incredibly difficult to do anything artistic or interesting.\nThe HTC One is arguably the best Android smartphone on the market. The industrial design is stunning to look at and the 4.7-inch display is one of the best in the business.\nFor the most part, Sense has been toned down and it\u2019s possible to take that approach even further through the various tweaks available in the settings menus.\nIt\u2019s not a breakthrough device though. There\u2019s nothing that the HTC One offers that makes it the \u201cmust-have\u201d option for an upgrade or Android enthusiast. Sure, it has an incredible processor and the RAM to match, but all of that feels a bit superfluous compared to the One X before it.\nHTC\u2019s attempts at innovating on the software side, meanwhile, have had mixed results. BlinkFeed is just a gimmick and doesn\u2019t change the way that you use a smartphone. The camera, while commendable for resisting the megapixel war, doesn\u2019t deliver on the promise of better images.\nThe HTC One is a great smartphone. History has proven, however, that being \u201cgreat\u201d isn\u2019t enough to combat Samsung\u2019s overpowering influence in the Android market. Until the Taiwanese manufacturer can produce a truly flawless or groundbreaking proposition, it will continue to struggle as it has for the last 12 months.", "What Is Transactional Strategy in a Business?\nBusinesses filling a one-time customer need might adopt a transactional strategy.\n1 What Is an Example of Transactional Marketing?\n2 What Is a Transnational Business Strategy?\nSmall-business owners in retail and service industries might be more likely to adopt or include elements of a transactional strategy in their marketing mix. While maintaining a friendly face may be a general business objective, marketing efforts in a transactional strategy focus more on increasing sales than on maintaining long-term customer relationships.\nBusinesses focused on meeting a specific need in single-sales transactions, rather providing a range of products or services as part of a comprehensive solution, are likely to adopt a transactional strategy. A defining characteristic is that the relationship between the business and customer typically lasts only as long as it takes for the sale to be completed. For example, a mortgage title company typically fulfills a single need -- issuing title insurance -- and the often more businesslike relationship between a customer and the company typically ends at the end of the transaction. In contrast, a bank focuses on serving a customer\u2019s short- and long-term financial needs and therefore works to establish a lasting relationship with customers.\nA pure transactional strategy and corresponding marketing efforts focus first on converting potential buyers into paying customers and second on maximizing each sale. This strategy relies solely on product, pricing, placement and promotion -- the four Ps of marketing -- to deliver value and create a positive perception about the business in the minds of prospective customers. The main objective is increasing sales through product availability and value-based perceptions.\nPrice is the most important of the four Ps in a transactional strategy. This can work for and against the business depending on circumstance and the ability to control inventory costs. A main issue is that transactional strategies can require the business to adopt a defensive pricing strategy. Because value perceptions are essentially based on price, customers may abandon your business if a competitor lowers prices unless you follow suit. Defensive pricing strategies taken to an extreme can, in a worst-case scenario, threaten the future of a business by eroding profit margins.\nA marketing strategy that doesn\u2019t include relationship-building activities can be less expensive for a small-business owner to implement. Customers are viewed as a means to an end, rendering such things as a customer service department and a trained sales staff essentially unnecessary. While this strategy may be successful when consumer demand is high and the economy is expanding, it may fall short if demand lags or the business can\u2019t further reduce costs or prices.\nLohrey, Jackie. \"What Is Transactional Strategy in a Business?\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/transactional-strategy-business-78432.html. Accessed 23 April 2019.\nWhat Is Positioning in a Marketing Plan?", "Smart villages intend to use the full potential of digital technologies to unlock job opportunities in a bid to counter rural poverty and depopulation, MEP Franc Bogovi\u010d told EURACTIV ahead of an event to promote his initiative.\nTogether with MEP Tibor Szanyi (S&D), Bogovi\u010d (EPP) started the Smart Villages for Europe movement with the aim to reverse the current depopulation and brain drain from rural to urban areas across Europe. With the support of the two largest groups in the European Parliament, the two secured a budget for their project in the EU\u2019s 2018 budget line.\nBogovi\u010d (EPP) spoke to EURACTIV\u2019s Claire Stam in a telephone interview.\n\u201cWe already know that less and less money is being made with basic agriculture and we have to bring more added-value in rural areas,\u201d Bogovi\u010d said.\nThe Aim of the Smart Villages movement is to revitalise rural communities and make them more attractive and sustainable by using the full potential of digital and telecommunication technologies, he explained.\nBogovi\u010d hosted the European Action for Smart Villages, which took place at lake Bled in Slovenia on Friday (13 April), together with Violeta Bulc, the European Commissioner for Transport.\nThe conference was attended by Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan, Maria Gabriel, Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society and Regional Policy Commissioner Corina Cretu. MEP Tibor Szanyi and Pekka Pesonen, the Secretary-General of Copa Cogeca, were also present.\n\u201cEU rural areas offer great business opportunities and they can become even more attractive if we can attract investors and enable farmers and other local actors to use their potential\u00bb, Bogovi\u010d said, citing biomass, sustainable food production, tourism and culture as examples of new business opportunities that can be unlocked by the deployment of digital technologies in rural areas.\nBogovi\u010d recalled his experience as a mayor of a small rural town in Slovenia and as the minister of agriculture and environment in Slovenia.\n\u201cSome 84% of Slovenian farms are small or medium-sized farmers. Their number has been dropping rapidly, with a nearly 14% decrease in recent years, which accounted for a decrease in jobs by close to 20%,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut we know that small and medium-sized enterprises generate more jobs on average than large multinational producers. That\u2019s the case in Slovenia but also elsewhere in Europe,\u201d Bogovi\u010d added.\nIn this context, digitisation is key to revitalise rural areas and make them more attractive.

I\u2019m Charles Lenchner.\nNew revelations about the arms deal between Israel and Germany is rocking the Israeli election campaign just two weeks before the elections. The state witness Mickey Ganor, who was the agent of the German Thyssenkrupp arms company in Israel, has been arrested by the police after he suddenly changed his story and violated the terms of the deal he made with Israeli police. At the same time, new evidence emerged that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has sold stocks in the GrafTech international company, which is a steel company providing components for the German company, making a profit of 400 percent, about four and a half million dollars.\nIt was also revealed that the German government requested Netanyahu\u2019s permission before selling similar submarines to Egypt. Netanyahu claimed before that he never gave such permission, but new evidence has shown that he lied and in fact authorized the German-Egypt arms deal, boosting the profits of GrafTech international, in which he was a stockholder. Major General Benny Gantz heads the party Blue and White, which is trying to unseat Netanyahu in the upcoming election. At a recent press conference, he had the following things to say.\nShir Hever is a correspondent for The Real News Network living in Heidelberg, Germany. His most recent book is The Privatization of Israeli Security, published in 2017 by Pluto Press. Thank you, Shir, for joining us.\nSHIR HEVER: Thanks for having me, Charles.\nCHARLES LENCHNER: The Israeli media has given codes to all these corruption cases they call it 1000, 2000, 3000, but now the revelations are regarding specifically case 3000, in which no indictment was issued. Help us understand what this case is about and how it\u2019s different than the other three.\nSHIR HEVER: Right. So the cases 1000, 2000, and 4000 are the ones that there was an indictment for. And they are quite similar cases, because in all of these three cases, the issue is about billionaires who control media empires who received various, or allegedly received, various benefits from Netanyahu, who used his political power of those media empires in exchange for favorable coverage or for various gifts that he received from that.\nCase 3000, which is now dominating the headlines, is very different from that. And the reason is that it\u2019s not about media, but rather about the arms trade. Germany has sold Israel both submarines and heavy warships, which the Israeli navy actually said they don\u2019t need. And they bought them anyway, because two percent of the deal was given as commission, which when we talk about two percent, it already counts as a bribe, actually to Mickey Ganor, who then turned state witness. And Mickey Ganor is a friend of Netanyahu, he was appointed by him to the National Security Council of Israel. His lawyer, David Shimron, is also the lawyer of Netanyahu and also happens to be the cousin of Netanyahu. So the web of connections is very tight.\nAnd Netanyahu kept insisting that he doesn\u2019t know anything about it. And the state attorney at the time, Mandelblit, very strangely announced when he started the investigation of this case 3000, about the arms deal, that Netanyahu was not a suspect, which is a very strange thing to say when you start an investigation, that you\u2019re already excluding the possibility that somebody who\u2019s very much in the middle of this story is even going to be indicted at some point. Now, when all of this evidence is coming out, it of course shows that the decision of Mandelblit not to press charges is challenged, Mandelblit\u2019s reputation is under attack, as this evidence is pretty condemning considering Netanyahu.\nCHARLES LENCHNER: So it feels as though there\u2019s a lot of evidence being brought from the past, and all of this is coming out now, two weeks before the election. So I\u2019m wondering, is this coming out now because somewhere in the in the state apparatus there\u2019s a desire to punish Netanyahu before the elections and damage him, or is there another reason why this information is only coming out now?\nSHIR HEVER: It all goes to this press conference that we\u2019ve just seen a short segment from. Because in fact, most of the facts regarding this arms deal have been known for years. The German government announced that they\u2019re going to suspend trade until it will be clear that there is no corruption involved. But then, when people started to get arrested and the idea that corruption is involved has become obvious, then the Germans decided they were going to go ahead with the deal anyway because they want the money.\nSo we\u2019ve already gone through several stages. It was reported in the German media, it was reported in the Israeli media. But a lot of the facts were not put together, for example, the fact that the Germans said, we got approval from the Israeli government to sell submarines to Egypt. And that made a lot of Israelis think well, OK, so the Israeli government approved it. What is new about this story is the fact that in this press conference that we\u2019ve just seen, it was not just Benny Gantz speaking. There was a whole series of people who spoke, and all of these people are senior members of this new party called Blue and White, and they\u2019re all former members of cabinet or commanders of the army, chiefs of staff of the army. So these people have all been in a position to observe all of the malfeasance going on, the bribery, the lying, and they said nothing at the time.\nAnd now, they\u2019re coming up just two weeks before the election to try to change the momentum and get a few votes right when the polls are about to close. But I think what they\u2019re doing is actually also exposing their own incompetence. Because when Moshe Dayan, example was the Minister of Defense, he said he doesn\u2019t want to have the submarine deal because it doesn\u2019t serve Israeli strategic interests and it\u2019s a terrible waste of money. But that\u2019s it, he just said it to Netanyahu. He didn\u2019t resign, he didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it. So now when he\u2019s saying oh, you lied to me, you didn\u2019t give me all the information, that sounds a bit strange. Why didn\u2019t you say something at the time? And I think that actually shows that these politicians who are trying to portray themselves as alternatives to Netanyahu are also not very honest and straight in their politics.\nCHARLES LENCHNER: There\u2019s a joke, that instead of Israel having an army, it\u2019s an army that has a state, that goes around. And the security establishment is one of the most trusted parts of Israeli society. What is changing here? Is there a sense the either complicity or silence or malfeasance of all of these different parts of the security establishment is changing something about how the Israeli public looks at that?\nSHIR HEVER: I think that\u2019s a very deep change in Israeli society. And Israeli society used to be one of the most militaristic societies in the world, and it is quite militaristic today, still more than most countries in the world, but actually, the militarism is going down. The idea that when a general speaks, everyone has to be quiet and listen to them, is indeed the reason for such jokes like you just said. And there is a lot of those jokes. And this idea that Israeli security comes before anything else is now crumbling at the seams.\nWe\u2019re seeing actually that Netanyahu was able to pull off something that no politician before him was able to do. He decided, for his own reasons, for his own agenda, to go against the security elite, to go against the generals. All the generals said, we don\u2019t want submarines, and he said, no, but I want submarines, and he got his way. And that\u2019s very interesting. And he\u2019s still leading at the polls, which means that the Israeli public is still willing to take his word over the word of all the generals. This party, the Blue and White party is really riding the wake of this dominance or the hegemony of the Israeli security elite, the generals, in the Israeli political sphere. But it\u2019s not such overwhelming as it was before, and today people are not necessarily going to vote for them just because they\u2019re generals.\nCHARLES LENCHNER: It makes you wonder who is breaking the covenant between the security establishment and the Israeli public. Both of them seem to be dancing together on this one. Thank you very much, Shir Hever.\nSHIR HEVER: Thank you, Charles.\nCHARLES LENCHNER: Thank you, Shir. And thank you for joining us at the Real News Network. Thank you sheer.", "COSTA MESA \u2014 Derwin James wasn\u2019t around for the Chargers\u2019 painful finishes in years past.

In a year marked by a series of deadly mass shootings, 55 percent of Americans favor stricter gun control legislation\u2014an increase of 8 percentage points from last year.\nBut if past polling trends are any indication, support for gun control may quickly subside as the most recent mass shootings recede from memory. Support for more stringent gun legislation climbed to 58 percent in 2013, following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that claimed 26 lives, but promptly dropped to 49 percent within a year.\nGallup\u2019s poll was conducted from October 7 to 11, just one week after a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon and four months after the massacre of African American parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.\nSupport for gun control rose nearly equally among gun owners and non-owners alike, jumping by 6 and 7 percentage points, respectively. Republicans registered a slight decline of 2 percentage points in support for gun control laws, while support rose by 6 points among Democrats and 11 percentage points among independents.\nEven if Americans\u2019 concern about guns proves ephemeral, gun control has quickly become a key issue in the Democratic presidential primary contest.

The clamor from this machine's drives dampens after 15 seconds or so, after which you're left with a quieter--but by no means quiet--desktop powerhouse built for business. The ClientPro 565 that MPC sent to us came packed with high-end hardware, including a muscle-bound Intel Pentium 4 560 CPU running at 3.6GHZ, 1GB of 533MHz RAM, a dazzling 19-inch LCD, two mammoth hard drives, and even an Iomega Rev drive for extra storage and backups . These and other goodies somewhat explain the system's sky-high price, but a few cut corners and better deals from competitors take the shine off. MPC's splendid support helps restore some of the lost luster, but it doesn't do enough to sweeten the deal.\nThe hulking, gray ClientPro 565 tower looks a bit unkempt with its off-white drives, but it's a reasonably attractive system overall. It has ample room for interior expansion, with two open memory slots, four available drive bays, three unused PCI slots, and two 1x PCI Express slots. On the outside, you'll find all the usual ports, parallel and serial included, plus the now-standard complement of USB 2.0 (two in front, four in back), FireWire (one front, one rear), and audio ports in front and back. The only thing missing is a media-card reader--a component we consider essential even in a business system, considering the amount and the different types of data and devices we deal with on a day-to-day basis.\nOf course, the Iomega Rev drive located in a front-panel 3.5-inch drive bay is a welcome inclusion, offering 35GB of storage space (and up to 90GB compressed, according to Iomega) on each removable cartridge; one is included. Our ClientPro 565 also included a pair of Seagate 200GB Serial ATA hard drives connected to an onboard RAID controller and configured for contiguous storage, meaning you have a whopping 400GB available as a single drive. A Sony 8X multiformat DVD burner rounds out the ClientPro 565's superb storage array.\nIn place of the poky onboard graphics chip found in most business systems, MPC supplied our ClientPro 565 with a 256MB eVGA GeForce PCX 5750 PCI Express video card. While this midrange card can't really keep up with the latest games, it offers sufficient muscle for business applications, video editing, and most consumer-level graphics software. Its counterpart is MPC's F1925 monitor, a 19-inch LCD that leverages its 500:1 contrast ratio and 25ms response time to deliver crisp text and gorgeous images. Too bad it doesn't rotate for Portrait computing.\nEven the speakers are unusually robust for a business system. The Creative Inspire 2.1 2500 includes two 60-watt satellites and a subwoofer, which gave our ClientPro 565 the power to do justice to business audio and after-hours playlists alike. We did find the speakers' wired remote a bit of an annoyance--we'd prefer speaker-mounted volume controls.\nWith such a high-end roster of components, we can't understand why MPC would include a wired, no-brand keyboard and mouse. They're sufficiently comfortable and functional, but in a system priced close to $4,000, we expect wireless versions of these peripherals.\nConsidering its price tag, we also expected the MPC ClientPro 565 to turn in pack-leading performance, both among business PCs and among other systems with similar configurations. Indeed, on our application performance benchmark, the ClientPro 565 easily bested the older HP Compaq Business Desktop dc7100 and also hung in with a handful of mainstream PCs with similar specs. Its 3D performance was less than impressive, but the ClientPro 565 can run older 3D games at respectable frame rates if you keep the detail settings down. This means you can indulge in at least some after-hours gaming. While it might not be necessary for most offices, for nearly $4,000, the ClientPro 565 should show more dominant 3D performance. For application performance, far more important to most businesses, the ClientPro 565 scores well, but comparably configured PCs, such as the soon-to-be-reviewed Gateway 7200XL (priced at $2,625), cost much less.\nMPC supplies a standard mix of software, including Norton AntiVirus (with a 90-day subscription), Nero Express, and InterVideo's WinDVD 5.0. You also get a somewhat unusual extra: Pinnacle Studio 9.0, a popular and versatile video-editing program. Most business users would prefer an office suite, but anyone interested in video production will welcome Studio 9.0.\nThe ClientPro 565 includes plenty of support. MPC provides a three-year warranty on parts and labor, with onsite service included for the duration. Phone support is toll-free and 24/7, but it, too, expires after three years. The company's online support continues to fall short, with no real-time help, no FAQ pages, and a generally confusing support site. We were pleased to find a comprehensive quick-start guide bundled with the system, something other MPC systems have lacked, so hopefully the company will address its weak online support, as well.\nTo measure application performance, CNET Labs uses BAPCo's SysMark 2004, an industry-standard benchmark.

Students will be creating 72 eight inch by eight inch panels of their impressions of Claude Monet's famous water lily paintings, Waddell said.\nMany of Monet's paintings were more than six feet tall, and by painting 72 panels and displaying them together, the students pay homage not only to the size of Monet's works, but also to the vastness of his collection, Waddell added. Monet completed more than 250 water lily paintings in the last 30 years of his life, she said.\nThrough this project, students will learn about plein air painting, impressionism, and the history of Monet's home in Giverny, France, where Monet himself painted outdoors in his garden. Their work will be displayed at New Waters Realty on Oct. 26-27.\nThe Paint Out is presented by the Pike Road Arts Council, formed in 2012 as part of the ENHANCE Initiative. ENHANCE is a detailed plan for accomplishing work in four key areas known as the town\u2019s four pillars: quality of life, planning, services and education. ENHANCE stresses the enrichment of quality of life, and includes organizations and projects related to exercise, nutrition, health, agriculture, nature and community education.\n\u201cThe Pike Road Paint Out is one of the arts council\u2019s main events each year.

It was my new favorite because it changed something in me. It\u2019s almost impossible to explain why, but after reading it I felt more confident in myself, less uncertain about my future. I became more assertive with my bosses. I got back on the horse, so to speak, and applied to three more graduate schools. I attended three interviews and got accepted to all three schools (without mentioning War and Peace at all). As weird as it sounds, reading War and Peace put me back in control of my life\u2014and that\u2019s why it\u2019s my favorite book.\nBut according to Dr Josie Billington, deputy director of the Centre for Research into Reading at the University of Liverpool, my experience wasn\u2019t so odd. It\u2019s actually the norm for people who read a lot\u2014and one of the main benefits of reading that most people don\u2019t know about.\nReading for pleasure can help prevent conditions such as stress, depression, and dementia.\nAnd those possible avenues of action don\u2019t have to mimic those in the book. After all, I had no interest in learning the best ways to fend off a French invasion, even though that was a major part of the story in War and Peace. Rather it was in reading about the challenges the dozens of characters in War and Peace faced that I learned to look at my life\u2019s challenges from a renewed perspective.\n\u201cPeople who read find it easier to make decisions, plan, and prioritize, and this may be because they are more able to recognize that difficulty and setback are unavoidable aspects of human life,\u201d says Billington\u2014and astonishingly these aren\u2019t the only hidden benefits of reading regularly that researchers are now discovering.\nIf the standard benefits of reading, which include knowledge absorption and entertainment, were only complemented by the additional benefits of the ability to refocus, regroup, and make better decisions, it would be enough to argue that everyone should read for their own good. But according to Billington and Sue Wilkinson, the CEO of The Reading Agency, a UK charity that develops and delivers programs to encourage people to read more, experts are now discovering reading has numerous additional benefits to physical and psychological health.\nReading helps promote respect for and tolerance of others\u2019 views.\nWilkinson also notes that people who read books regularly \u201care on average more satisfied with life, happier, and more likely to feel that the things they do in life are worthwhile.\u201d A recent survey of 1,500 adult readers found that 76% of them said that reading improves their life and helps to make them feel good.\nAnd despite reading generally being considered a solitary experience, research has shown that reading has benefits for society at large\u2014beyond helping create more educated people. Wilkinson points out that it\u2019s been proven that reading improves empathy and increases social support.\nA reader\u2019s template of what the world is, is widened, and their place within it feels more secure.\nThere\u2019s much to be said for reading the greats like Tolstoy, Hemingway, and Proust, but Wilkinson stresses that the benefits of reading aren\u2019t limited to the great literary works.\n\u201cAll reading is good, and enjoying whatever you are reading is the most important thing,\u201d says Wilkinson, who notes that The Reading Agency\u2019s Reading Ahead program for adults operates on this principle: it\u2019s the act of reading that is most important\u2014not what you read.\nBillington notes that two-fifths of people in the latest Quick Reads study cited \u201clack of time\u201d as their chief barrier to reading. Yet the same study found that adults who read for just 30 minutes a week reported feeling 20% more satisfied with their lives.\n\u201cSo it is worthwhile making just a few minutes time in a day for reading, it seems: when waiting for a bus, or for children outside school, or on the train, think twice before social messaging and pick up a book instead,\u201d says Billington.\nOnce you\u2019ve started making the time to read more, Wilkinson says the next step is to set challenges to keep yourself motivated. If you normally read fiction, for example, try switching it up with non-fiction. This keeps things new and fresh, which means you\u2019re both more likely to continue reading and more likely to find new favorite authors and subjects, which perpetuates the drive to keep reading.\nAdults who read for just 30 minutes a week reported feeling 20% more satisfied with their lives.\nBoth Wilkinson and Billington agree that it\u2019s very important not to continue forcing yourself to read something you aren\u2019t enjoying.\nThat\u2019s not to say you should be prepared to give up too soon, however. \u201cIf you\u2019re returning to reading after a long time, or finding it for the first time, it can be difficult to believe you can see the whole thing through, and some books take a while to do their work inside us,\u201d say Billington.\nAnd as the research now shows us, it\u2019s those that choose to continue reading that benefit from the act in more ways than previously thought possible.", "Here's some welcome news for people putting money away for retirement: The IRS has raised the 2019 contribution limits for various types of retirement savings accounts and for health savings accounts. If you participate in a 401(k) or similar plan, you should keep the new limits in mind as you think about your cash flow and financial planning for next year.\nThe annual limit on contributions in 2019 for tax-advantaged plans such as 401(k), 403(b), 457 and so on is $19,000, up from the current limit of $18,500. And if you're age 50 or older at any time during the year (even if your 50th birthday falls on Dec. 31), you can also make additional catch-up contributions of an additional $6,000, for a total annual contribution of $25,000.\nPeople who are self-employed can also set up and fund their own 401(k) profit-sharing plan, which allows for the same contribution limits as above. The self-employed can make two kinds of contributions to these plans: the employee's contribution and the employer's profit-sharing contribution. This type of plan is easy to set up at any major brokerage firm, and the contributions reduce your adjusted gross income, which results in considerable tax savings.\nFor an individual who declares about $80,000 in net profit from self-employment, the total pretax contribution is about $33,900 in 2019. If you're 50 or older, you can contribute about $39,900. If you're 50 or older and make a profit of $196,000 or more in 2019, the maximum pretax contribution is $62,000, which is also the maximum annual contribution to this type of plan.\nThe new limit for contributions to IRAs for those under age 50 with earned income from wages is increased to $6,000 from $5,500. This limit applies to any type of IRA in 2019. Those 50 and older in 2019 can make an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000, for a total annual contribution of $7,000.\nThe IRS also announced that it increased all income limits used in determining eligibility to make deductible contributions to traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs and even for claiming the Savers Credit.\nSingle taxpayers who are eligible to participate in a workplace retirement plan are also eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA if their adjusted gross income is below $64,000 ($103,000 for marrieds) in 2019. This is up from $63,000 (singles) and $101,000 (marrieds) in 2018. This deduction is phased out when AGI is between $64,000 and $74,000 (singles) and $103,000 to $123,000 (marrieds).\nThe income range for making contributions to a Roth IRA in 2019 is $122,000 to $137,00 (singles and heads of households) and $193,000 to $203,000 (marrieds).\nThe 2019 income limit for the Savers Credit (also called the retirement savings contributions tax credit), which is for low- to middle-income workers who contribute to a retirement plan or IRA, is $64,000 for married workers (up from $63,000), $48,000 for heads of households and $32,000 for single filers (up from $31,500).\nThe 2019 annual HSA contribution limit for individuals with single medical coverage is $3,500, an increase of $50 from 2018. The limit is $7,000 for those covered under qualifying family plans (up from $6,900 in 2018). But if you're 55 or older in 2019, you can contribute an additional $1,000 annually, or $4,500 total to an HSA for singles and $8,000 for families.\nIf you're enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, you really should take advantage of this special savings opportunity. Make it a point to set aside pretax money into an HSA because you don't pay taxes on the earnings, which can also be withdrawn tax-free in retirement when used to reimburse yourself for qualified medical expenses.", "Families, it's time for \"the talk.\"\nNo, not the one about the birds and the bees. For aging parents and their adult children, talking about big financial issues like retirement goals, estate plans and health-care wishes can go a long way toward reducing misconceptions and easing family tensions.\nBut those talks don't happen as often or as successfully as they should, according to a recent study by Fidelity Investments, which found that nearly two-thirds of families disagree about the optimal time for such discussions, with adult children generally preferring earlier talks than parents.\n\"There are a lot of different dependencies in families over time,\" said Lauren Brouhard, senior vice president of retirement at Fidelity. But in this instance, she said, the children seem to have the right idea. \"To have those conversations sooner increases peace of mind.\"\nSome 75 percent of adult children and their parents in the survey agreed that it is important to have frank conversations about retirement expenses, eldercare and estate planning. But only 44 percent have had detailed discussions about covering living expenses in retirement. Just 37 percent had discussed health care and eldercare in depth, and 59 percent had had detailed conversations about wills and estates.\n\"The older generation never talked about money, so sometimes they're not comfortable talking about money with their kids,\" said Jon Yankee, a financial advisor and partner in FJY Financial.\nBarry Glassman, president of Glassman Wealth Services, said that sometimes his older clients are reluctant to discuss financial plans with their kids because they are still sorting out their own priorities.\n\"I'm not sure many of them have reconciled it themselves. If they have, it's in a document, but it's not necessarily in a conversation,\" he said.\nPart of the issue, Glassman said, is that being 70 years old today is not the same as being 70 a generation ago. People are living longer, and generally feeling better along the way.\n\"Many of them are still traveling and exploring,\" he said. \"They don't feel old, and maybe they don't feel old enough to have that conversation.\"\nNonetheless, experts say these discussions can help all members of a family breathe easier.\n\"Adult children at some point are probably going to be asked to accept some real responsibility,\" said Fidelity's Brouhard. As an example, \"we are seeing more and more that it's the eldest daughter that is taking on some responsibility, especially related to health care or medical issues. There are implications of this in terms of women needing to off-ramp and on-ramp into the workforce, and it could have long-term financial consequences for them. It all relates to having a more informed plan.\"\nHow can families have these sensitive discussions more easily?\nGlassman pointed out that today's boomers who are dealing with their own parent's financial situation now may be more motivated to get their own long-term plans settled.\n\"They've been thrown into decisions and caring for their parents, so I believe they understand what it is that their kids may go through,\" he said.\nYankee looks for opportunities when his older clients are reviewing their own documents. \"If their documents say my first son does this and the other that, part of our questioning is, 'Are they aware of this? Do they know what to do if something were to happen to you?'\" Yankee said. \"We coach them to have that discussion.\"\nSome aging parents opt to share information on legal arrangements and accounts, leaving dollar amounts out of the picture, Yankee said. They may put together paperwork that lists their accountant, their lawyer, their financial advisor, their account numbers, and the like, so the children know what to do but the parents don't have to reveal everything.\n\"Older clients are proactively asking how to have that conversation but not spill all the beans,\" he said.\nWhen Yankee works with clients in their 30s and 40s on wills and estates, he said, that sometimes gives them an opening. \"That's an easy entree with them to talk to their parents\u2014as in, these are questions that have come up and I thought maybe we should talk about these things too.\"\nThe Fidelity study found that adult children regularly underestimate their parents' estates, but Glassman said that isn't the point.\n\"There is always worry about is there enough money in case a parent gets sick,\" he said. \"They know their parents want a good quality of life.\"", "Saturday 30 August marked the 25th anniversary of the International Day of the Disappeared. Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International, calls on Pakistan's new government to publish details on those held in secret detention and shed light on the fate of many disappeared citizens. Pakistan\u2019s new ruling coalition may have successfully forced Pervez Musharraf to resign but it still has not done much to reverse his administration\u2019s abusive human rights legacy. Twenty five years since the International Day of the Disappeared was launched, Pakistan has joined the list of nations practising enforced disappearances as a direct consequence of its alliance with the US-led \"war on terror\". This particularly painful legacy of the Musharraf era has subjected hundreds, if not thousands, to enforced disappearances -- the practice under which people are kidnapped, held in secret locations outside any judicial or legal system, and often tortured, sometimes to the point of death. Pakistan not only shamefully helped fill the wire cages at Guant\u00e1namo Bay's Camp X Ray and the secret prisons of the CIA by handing some of the detainees to the US authorities but also incarcerated many secretly in Pakistan itself. Held out of sight and without charge, with no word to their families and loved ones (much less lawyers), the fate of many of them remain unknown to this day. In September 2006, after Amnesty International published its first report on the disappeared in Pakistan, I wrote to President Musharraf and in January 2007 met with the then Prime Minister Shawkat Aziz to urge the government to investigate and end the appalling practice of abduction and secret detention. I never received a satisfactory response. If the leaders of the ruling coalition want to demonstrate they are serious about changing Musharraf\u2019s policies, they should immediately reveal details of where the hundreds of disappeared are being held. And then they must begin the process of establishing some control and accountability over the country\u2019s notorious security agencies, chief among them the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), which carried out these enforced disappearances. Amnesty International\u2019s recent report 'Denying the Undeniable: Enforced Disappearances in Pakistan', used official court records and affidavits of victims and witnesses of enforced disappearances to show how government officials, especially from the security and intelligence agencies, obstructed attempts to trace those who had disappeared. The report reveals a pattern of security or other forces arbitrarily detaining people (some of them children, in one case a nine-year-old boy), blindfolding them, and moving them around various detention centres so they become difficult to trace. Take the case of Dr. Imran Munir, a Malaysian citizen of Pakistani origin, who was arrested in July 2006 and whose whereabouts remained unknown until Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court demanded information from Pakistani authorities. After the Supreme Court took up regular hearings of cases about the disappeared in late 2006, around a hundred disappeared persons were traced, having either been released or found in recognized places of detention. Dr. Munir was one those lucky ones; during the course of hearings on his case, it became apparent that various security agencies had tried to hide him even after the Supreme Court had ordered his appearance in court. The Supreme Court under Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry became impatient with such obfuscation and denial and announced in October 2007 that it would summon the heads of the intelligence agencies to explain their role in enforced disappearances and would initiate legal action against those found responsible. Dr Munir was set to record his statement regarding his enforced disappearance, as well as information about others subjected to enforced disappearance, when the hearing was disrupted by Musharraf\u2019s imposition of the state of emergency in November last year and the unlawful deposing of independent-minded judges. Musharraf\u2019s Declaration of Emergency expressed his indignation succinctly when it spoke of \u201cjudicial interference\u201d in the government\u2019s fight against terrorism. The sacking of the judges, clearly and crucially in anticipation of a negative decision in respect of the eligibility of Musharraf to the office of the presidency, got rid of this irritant. Not surprisingly, the hand-picked new judges of the Supreme Court have not found it necessary -- or opportune -- to resume hearings about the hundreds of petitions relating to disappeared persons. A confrontation with those responsible for enforced disappearances, including Pakistan\u2019s notorious intelligence services, apparently takes more determination, grit and political will than they appear able to muster. Thus the fate of the disappeared has become closely entwined with that of Pakistan\u2019s higher judiciary. It seems unlikely that the disappeared will receive appropriate judicial scrutiny for the time being, given the controversy over the reinstatement of deposed judges. But the new government need not await judicial pressure to shed light on the fate of the disappeared. The government can use its executive authority to demand that the ISI and other security agencies provide information about those subjected to enforced disappearance. As a first step, the government should immediately gather and publicize a list of all those in government detention. It\u2019s good record-keeping; it\u2019s basic law enforcement; it\u2019s also the law. In April 2008, shortly after the elections, Law Minister Farooq Naik stated that the government was collecting details of disappeared persons and pledged that all would be released. Now is the time to go public with that information. Providing information about the fate of the disappeared would bring some solace to hundreds of families -- thousands of people -- who continue to fear for the lives of their loved ones, aware that torture and other ill-treatment are routine in Pakistani places of detention. By abducting and detaining terrorist suspects in secret hiding places, or failing to investigate and reveal the fate of the disappeared the government violates human rights and does little to counter terrorism. By arresting and prosecuting those suspected of terrorism in accordance with the rule of law the government can show its commitment to both human rights and fighting terrorism. It would also send a clear, immediate signal of a radical break with the Musharraf era, and at very little cost -- something very important to the fractious new government as it faces the many woes besetting the country such as a slumping economy, high fuel costs and a growing Taliban insurgency in the areas bordering Afghanistan. Pakistan's new government has a clear choice: it can continue the bankrupt and brutal anti-human rights practices of the Musharraf regime or it can counter terror with justice and put the country on the path of the rule of law and human rights.", "Shin-Soo Choo reached base a career-high six times and Joey Votto tallied four hits, but the Cincinnati Reds still struggled to defeat the Miami Marlins on Saturday. The Reds will attempt to be more efficient and take three of four from the Marlins at home when the teams conclude their series on Sunday. Votto homered while Choo had three hits and drew three walks, but Cincinnati went 1-for-12 with runners in scoring position and stranded 17 runners in the 3-2, 13-inning win.\nMiami's woeful offense continued its miserable pace in the loss, scoring more than three runs only twice through 18 games. Both of those outings have come when Sunday's starter, Alex Sanabia, has taken the mound. The young right-hander has been given 13 runs of support in his three outings, one less than the rest of the rotation combined in their 15 starts.\nSanabia has benefited from the two times Miami's offense has given its starters decent run support, including his last outing against Washington. The 24-year-old allowed two runs and six hits over six innings in Tuesday's 8-2 victory over the Nationals. He tossed six scoreless frames in his only road start against the New York Mets, but is allowing left-handed hitters to bat 8-for-24 against him - a troubling trend against a Reds team that features Choo, Votto and Jay Bruce at the top of the order.\nBailey enjoyed one of the best performances of his career in Tuesday's 1-0 victory over Philadelphia, but was stuck with a no-decision despite tying a career high with 10 strikeouts. The seventh overall pick of the 2004 draft allowed only two hits over eight innings, becoming only the second pitcher in the last 10 seasons to go at least eight innings and strike out 10 batters on fewer than 90 pitches. In four career starts against the Marlins, Bailey is 1-1 with a 2.84 ERA.\n1. The Reds' 17 stranded runners Saturday matched their highest total since May 25, 2011, in a 19-inning loss to Philadelphia.\n2. Marlins LF Juan Pierre has struck out three times in each of the last two days after fanning three times in a game only four times over his first 1,896 career contests.\n3. Cincinnati pitchers have allowed two runs or fewer in six consecutive games - the longest stretch since a six-game streak from July 10-19, 2010.", "HAVANA \u2013 International celebrities have flocked to Cuba in recent months to experience the attractions of an island previously off-limits, but which is now open to the world after renewing relations with the United States last July.\nOver the past few weeks Havana natives have seen more of the world\u2019s entertainment and sports stars strolling their streets than in the past 50 years, a fad that Cubans believe is only just beginning, as they watch with hope and incredulity the flood of the rich and famous like Mick Jagger and Katy Perry, the latest to join the trend.\nThe American singer took a break this month, halfway through her \u201cPrismatic World Tour\u201d of Latin America, to visit Havana \u2013 not once but twice \u2013 to the surprise of the usual patrons of the popular culture and leisure center Fabrica de Arte Cubano, a must-see for anyone visiting the Cuban capital.\nPerry included in her visit the juvenile theater company La Colmenita and a meeting last Thursday with sexologist Mariela Castro, daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro and promoter of campaigns against homophobia on the Communist-ruled island, with whom the singer conversed at a private bar.\nThe \u201cRoar\u201d vocalist\u2019s visit was widely covered by the state press \u2013 which previously tended to ignore such news \u2013 and which also reported the Oct. 13 stopover in Cuba of one of the greatest boxers of all time, Floyd Mayweather of the United States.\nMayweather visited training centers and chatted with sports fans, as did Spanish soccer players Sergio Ramos and Raul last June, along with Brazil\u2019s Edson Arantes Do Nascimento, better known as Pele, the latter two as part of an unprecedented New York Cosmos delegation to the island.\nThough few were able to glimpse legendary British rocker Mick Jagger in Havana, Cuban musicians and later Jagger himself posted pictures and notes on social media recounting his time in the Cuban capital, a visit that boosted rumors of a possible Rolling Stones concert here in March 2016.\nOther photos recently revealed that American singer Usher traveled to the island in early September with a group of friends including the rapper Ludacris.\nCuba fever is just beginning: the scoop of the week in local media was that haute couture brand Chanel has picked the island for its first fashion show in Latin America, specifically for the unveiling of its latest Cruise collection on May 3, 2016, by the firm\u2019s head designer and creative director, Germany\u2019s Karl Lagerfeld.", "Basseterre, St. Kitts, April 10, 2019 (SKNIS): The theme for St. Kitts and Nevis\u2019 Diplomatic Week 2019: \u201cSecuring a Resilient Future through Strategic Diplomacy and Effective Dialogue is in line with initiatives of the Commonwealth Secretariat, said Commonwealth Secretary-General the Right Honourable Patricia Scotland QC.\nThe secretary-general made the statement on April 09, 2019, at the opening ceremony for Diplomatic Week via a video message.\n\u201cThis Diplomatic Week theme of resilience building relates directly to so much of our longstanding and continuing Commonwealth collaboration.

Health officials in all three states with quarantine policies did not return messages from The Associated Press seeking details about enforcement.\nCuomo on Saturday acknowledged that the policy might be hard to enforce, according to the New York Daily News.\nThe governor said officials had never considered whether people refusing to go along with the order could face prosecution or arrest, adding \u201cIt\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve discussed, no,\u201d the newspaper said.\nIn her essay, Hickox described being stopped at Newark Liberty International and questioned over several hours after touching down Friday. She said none of those who questioned her would explain what was going on or what would happen to her.\nDoctors Without Borders executive director Sophie Delaunay complained Saturday about the \u201cnotable lack of clarity\u201d from state officials about the quarantine policies, and an American Civil Liberties Union official in New Jersey said the state must provide more information on how it determined that mandatory quarantines were necessary.\n\u201cCoercive measures like mandatory quarantine of people exhibiting no symptoms of Ebola and when not medically necessary raise serious constitutional concerns about the state abusing its powers,\u201d said Udi Ofer, executive director of the ACLU of New Jersey.\nDoctors Without Borders said Hickox has not been issued an order of quarantine specifying how long she must be isolated and is being kept in an unheated tent. It urged the \u201cfair and reasonable treatment\u201d of health workers fighting the Ebola outbreak.\n\u201cWe are attempting to clarify the details of the protocols with each state\u2019s departments of health to gain a full understanding of their requirements and implications,\u201d Delaunay said in a statement.\nChristie, campaigning Saturday in Iowa for a fellow Republican, said he sympathizes for Hickox but said he has to do what he can to ensure public health safety.\n\u201cMy heart goes out to her,\u201d the governor said, while also noting that state and local health officials would make sure quarantine rules are enforced. He said the New Jersey State Police won\u2019t be involved.\nHealth officials said preliminary tests for Ebola came back negative for Hickox but Newark University Hospital would not say if she would be released for the balance of the quarantine period or remain in the hospital.\nIn the very early stages of Ebola, patients may still test negative because the virus has not yet reached detectable levels in the blood. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it may take up to three days after the onset of symptoms for the virus to reach detectable levels in some patients, prompting repeat testing in some cases.\nHickox\u2019s mother, Karen Hickox, said Saturday her daughter probably wasn\u2019t expecting to be quarantined upon her return to the United States, but is dealing with it.\nThe quarantine measures were announced after a New York physician, Craig Spencer, working for Doctors Without Borders returned from Guinea was admitted to Manhattan\u2019s Bellevue Hospital Center earlier this week to be treated for Ebola.\nA senior White House official said Saturday that how to treat health care workers returning from the affected West African countries continues to be discussed at meetings on Ebola as the administration continues to take a \u201ccareful look\u201d at its policies.\n\u201cThe challenge now is how you translate this quarantine plan to operational protocol,\u201d Redlener said.\nHe warned that quarantines might discourage doctors and nurses from going to West Africa to help, an issue raised by aid groups and Dr. Rick Sacra, one of the American health care workers successfully treated for Ebola contracted while he worked in Liberia.\n\u201cUntil Ebola is under control in Africa, we\u2019re never going to see the end of such cases coming to the United States,\u201d Redlener said.", "Johnson, Norman 83 Nov. 27, 1932 Mar. 22, 2016 Norman Bruce Johnson, 83, was born Nov. 27, 1932, to Alec and Grace Johnson in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Norm was the sixth of seven siblings. Norm attended Moose Jaw Technical High School and, at the age of 17, became a brakeman on the Canadian Pacific Railway. Hockey though was his true calling. In 1951, Norm played junior hockey for his home team, the Moose Jaw Can- ucks. He proceeded to play in the International Hockey League and the Western Hockey League. At the age of 24, Norm was drafted by the Boston Bruins. Thus, this began his lustrous 16-year career in professional hockey. He retired in 1971 with the Portland Buckaroos, having won the Lester Patrick Cup. Norm went on to coach Western International Hockey League hockey in Spokane where they won the Allan Cup, and junior hockey in Brandon, Manitoba. Upon his retirement from hockey, Norm went on to become a successful developer. Norm replaced one stick with another, this time a golf club. He loved the game of golf and was an active member of Columbia Edgewater Country Club for over 30 years. Norm was married to the love of his life, Doreen Edwards Johnson, just shy of 59 years. It was fitting that their first date was at the Brandon ice rink. They married May 18, 1957, and went on to have three children. Norm was preceded in death by his parents, Alec and Grace Johnson; two of his four sisters, Lilian Johnson Andrews and Myra Johnson Paulson; and brothers, Roy Johnson and Elgin Johnson. Norm is survived by his wife, Doreen; children, Shane Johnson (Dawn Allen Johnson), Kella Johnson Horton (Joseph Horton) and Jay Johnson (Cheryl Stratton Johnson); sisters, Fay Johnson Hicks and Loretta Johnson Evans; nine grandchildren; and many nieces, nephews and friends.\n\"I watched Norm and all the Bucks back in the '60's and '70's.

I haven\u2019t read Milton, Plutarch or Goethe and don\u2019t know when or if I ever will.\nStill, swimming against the tide of distractions, I did read, and kept track of what I read, in 2018.\nI racked up 47 books. This may be fresh fodder for Pomona College, which delights in the number 47\u2019s ubiquity.\nWhat did I read? I carried my list of books read around the house Monday, pulling books from shelves and stacking them up on my living room floor to admire them. It\u2019s an annual ritual for me.\nThe results are always a pleasant surprise. For one thing, I end every year dismayed that I hadn\u2019t gotten to this book or that that I\u2019ve been meaning to read forever. Yet when all the books I\u2019d read that year are gathered, it strikes me that I didn\u2019t do so badly after all.\nAlso, often I\u2019ve forgotten books read earlier in the year. Seeing those books again is a warm reminder of happy days or weeks spent with them.\nIt turns out the very first thing I read in 2018 was one of John D. MacDonald\u2019s Travis McGee mysteries. As devotees know, that\u2019s a way to get a year off to a good start. The ninth of 21 McGees, the story involved the death of an old friend whom McGee suspects was murdered because he refused to sell his property to developers.\nDescending to a level of cheesiness undreamed of by Shelley, the next novel I read was the 11th of Sax Rohmer\u2019s Fu Manchu series, \u201cThe Shadow of Fu Manchu.\u201d I will make no great claims for them, but they\u2019re pulpy page-turners.\nOther light reading last year: \u201cThe Baker Street Letters\u201d by Michael Robertson, in which the contemporary lawyer who inherits the 221-B Baker St. address investigates a letter for help sent to the fictional Sherlock Holmes; \u201cMake Room! Make Room!\u201d by Harry Harrison, the novel that inspired the movie \u201cSoylent Green\u201d; and \u201cThe Glass Key\u201d by Dashiell Hammett, one of the private eye master\u2019s terse, punchy mysteries.\nSome of my reading was heavier. I willingly read several hundred pages of Nathaniel Hawthorne short stories and one Shakespeare play, and liked them.\nTraveling to Poland and Germany last summer, my prose companions were Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial,\u201d about a lowly clerk who finds himself under suspicion by a shadowy bureaucracy, and John Brunner\u2019s \u201cThe Sheep Look Up,\u201d a forward-thinking 1972 novel about future environmental collapse.\nUrsula K. Le Guin\u2019s \u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness,\u201d from 1969, was about 50 years ahead of its time too. An envoy from the interstellar community makes first contact with a planet whose leaders must decide whether to join up or refuse to engage. That\u2019s timely today, but so is the planet\u2019s gender-fluidity and androgyny.\nOne thing about keeping track of your reading, and then looking at your books in a lump like this, is that it can alter your view of what you think you read. My self-image is of someone who likes literary fiction and reads little nonfiction.\nWell, I do like literary fiction, as a half-dozen of my titles bear out, but perhaps not as much as I thought. Also, more than one-third of my books last year were nonfiction. Who knew? I thought my choice of livelihood provided more than enough nonfiction, but evidently not.\nSome were about music, such as Beverly Mendheim\u2019s biography of Ritchie Valens and David Reyes and Tom Waldman\u2019s \u201cLand of a Thousand Dances,\u201d a study of Chicano rock.\nTwo were big-gulp chronicles of entire decades: David Halberstam\u2019s \u201cThe Fifties,\u201d which is recommended, and Todd Gitlin\u2019s \u201cThe Sixties,\u201d which isn\u2019t.\nTwo had local elements: \u201cAddicted to Americana\u201d by Ontario native Charles Phoenix, a tour of some of America\u2019s finest kitsch, and \u201cBanking on Beauty\u201d by Adam Arenson, a lavish history of Claremont artist Millard Sheets\u2019 design work for Howard Ahmanson\u2019s Home Savings Bank.\nKim Cooper\u2019s \u201cHow to Find Old Los Angeles\u201d is a guide to still-extant diners, bars, restaurants and other places that still carry the flavor of pre-war L.A.\nLewis Shiner\u2019s wistful \u201cGlimpses,\u201d about a time-traveling, middle-aged music fan who tries to save Jimi Hendrix, the Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cSmile\u201d and the Doors\u2019 third album while his own life goes to pieces.\nWilla Cather\u2019s \u201cO Pioneers!\u201d, about a woman making a success of herself on the Nebraska prairie.\nAnd Ring Lardner\u2019s \u201cHaircut and Other Stories,\u201d shining with Lardner\u2019s humor and his ability to reveal character through dialogue.\nYou can find a list of all 47 books on my blog, where you\u2019re encouraged to comment about your own year of reading.

He says a mishap at a gun range, in which he needed five stitches, is not the reason why. A bigger concern with Freeman, however, is his right (throwing) shoulder.\nThe quarterback suffered the injury on the Bucs' last offensive play against the Tennessee Titans. He did not throw in Wednesday's practice and coach Raheem Morris said the quarterback is day-to-day.\n\"It's sore,\" Morris said of Freeman's shoulder. \"Right now he's day-to-day. We were hoping he was able to go full-go today. He was limited. We'll have an opportunity to hopefully evaluate him (today) and the next day after that to get him going to see (if he'll) get a chance to play.\"\nMorris said the team could go all the way up to Saturday to determine if Freeman will get the start on Sunday against the Carolina Panthers. If Freeman cannot go, Morris said Josh Johnson would start.\n\"He's got to go out and execute the game plan,\" Morris said of Freeman. \"If he can execute the game plan and give us the best chance to win then he'll play.\"\nFreeman didn't mention the shoulder earlier Wednesday when talking to the media. He did talk about the gun incident and admitted using bad judgment going to the gun range during the regular season.\nThe incident happened shortly during the bye week and shortly after Freeman suffered a sprained thumb in the team's game against Chicago in London.\nFreeman, who said he grew up shooting guns with his father, said he went to a gun range and the recoil from the Desert Eagle semi-automatic handgun cut the top of his thumb. He needed five stitches for the cut.\n\"It was something never happened before,\" said Freeman, who said he shoots all the time during the offseason but that was just his second time going to the range during the season. \"It was weird that day.\n\"You know with a little free time during the bye week, I like to use the gun range,\" Freeman said. \"It's a little bit of escape. I grew up shooting guns with my dad. I always enjoyed shooting guns as a recreational thing. In hindsight, it wasn't the smartest decision. I've got to learn from it. No more shooting guns in the season.\"\nThis hasn't been the best season for Freeman. Following a 25-touchdown, six interception season in 2010, Freeman has just 12 touchdowns and 16 interceptions in 11 games this season. While his completion percentage is slightly higher than in 2010, his quarterback rating has taken a significant dip (95.9 in 2010 to 74.6 this year).\nFreeman said the cut didn't affect him. The Bucs nor Freeman mentioned the incident after it happened. Freeman said the cut did not hinder his throwing at all. The sprain, however, was tougher to deal with.\nThe numbers appear to support the third-year quarterback.\nIn the first game back following the break at New Orleans, Freeman had his best quarterback rating (103.5) of the season after he threw for 281 yards and a touchdown. His 73 percent completion rating during that game is the second highest of the season. Freeman wore a bandage that game.\nIn the following game against Houston, Freeman also wore a bandage but had his worst game of the season, throwing for 170 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions against the best defense in the league. He had season lows in quarterback rating (33.6) and completion percentage (45.5 percent on 15-of-33 passing). Those were the only two games he wore the bandage on his throwing hand.\n\"It really wasn't an issue,\" Freeman said. \"The scratch on the thumb was never anything that hindered me from doing anything. It wasn't painful. I just treated it as another scratch on the hand.\n\"What affected me was the sprain,\" he said. \"Game in and game out (it) kept getting hit and kept flaring back up, but it was mainly the sprain.\"\nFreeman said he talked with general manager Mark Dominik following the incident who told him it wasn't the best judgment in going to the range with a sprained thumb. The quarterback agreed.\n\"I shoot guns all the time,\" he said. \"Obviously it was poor choice in judgment doing it in season but at the end of the day, I've got to live with the consequences moving forward.\"\nNotes: Defensive tackle Brian Price (ankle) did not practice Wednesday. Morris said he will see if Price can go today or Friday. Defensive end Michael Bennett (groin) also did not practice but Morris said he is close to returning ...

Jessi had been shot, but Kelly\u2019s husband had managed to carry her back to their room at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. The wound was not life threatening, and the cousin's husband \u2014 a Los Angeles fire captain and the father of young children \u2014 had then gone back out to see if he could find some friends.\nIn the meantime, the wound was oozing and Jessi was in considerable pain. Kelly now told Brown over the phone that she had been calling the front desk with no immediate result.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Just call 911 saying you got a shooting victim who's continuing to bleed,\u2019\u201d Brown recalled.\nBrown delivered what emergency advice he could over the phone. He would have rushed to them himself, but the area was in lockdown. The most he could do was drive to the perimeter and pick up three of his cousins\u2019 friends, two of them firefighters from Glendale, California.\nBrown collected them and after they climbed into the back seat he saw that one of the firefighters, Steve Keyes, was bleeding.\nBrown examined the firefighter and saw that he had a graze wound extending from his chest to his stomach. Brown learned that if Keyes was not John Wayne, he and his fellow firefighter were exactly like firefighters everywhere.\n\u201cHe was doing CPR when he got shot,\u201d Brown reported.\nBrown took Keys and the two others to his home. Brown knew them from the anniversaries of 9/11, when they had joined him and his cousins in New York. Brown is the brother of FDNY Captain Patrick Brown, one of the most decorated firefighters in the department\u2019s history. Patrick Brown was killed as he ascended past the 35th floor of the North Tower.\nThe firefighters from Glendale had now shown similar courage as a madman with a golf bag full of assault rifles rained death down from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and people right next to them were shot.\nTo them, they were only doing what firefighters do. They were amazed by the bravery of the police officers who had charged toward the gunfire. The cops were no less courageous for responding exactly like cops everywhere, for doing what cops do.\nIn the morning, authorities were saying that at least one police officer was among the 58 dead.\nFrom his home, Brown reported that Keys and the others had left.\n\u201cEveryone is okay and trying to get home,\u201d Brown said.\nJessi was at Sunrise Hospital emergency room, where Brown himself used to work before taking a job at a nearby Air Force base.\nSixteen years ago, Mike Brown the doctor had been working to save a patient in the Sunrise Hospital ER even as he watched the live coverage of the burning Twin Towers, knowing that his firefighter brother was inside, climbing up into direst danger.\nAs Brown kept trying to save a life he watched the North Tower and then the South Tower collapse, killing his brother, along with 342 other members of FDNY, 23 members of the NYPD and 37 members of the Port Authority Police Department.\nBefore then and since then, firefighters and cops have shown similar courage on countless occasions.

He has since sold the quarry.\nIn the High Court, Daisley said WDC breached its statutory duty under the Resource Management Act and was negligent when issuing the abatement, infringement and enforcement notices.\nHis claim against Peters was that the lawyer was instructed to advise him as to whether WDC was responsible for the infringement actions and on his options against WDC.\nJustice Anne Hinton declined to grant leave for Daisley last year to make an application for summary judgment because she was not satisfied WDC had no arguable defence.\nShe said Daisley's application was out of time, being brought two-and-a-half years after the key factual matters became known to him.\nIn a recent judgment on costs, Justice Hinton ordered him to pay WDC $14,000 in costs and a further $95 in disbursements.\nDaisley's main claim against WDC and Peters is still before the court.", "Groundnut, one of the major crops in the district is withering away. With the failure of a major oil seed, the farmers are in the throngs of a financial crisis. They can neither harvest the crop as the soil has dried up completely. The farmers in this drought-prone area are dependent on rains for agriculture. The dwindling yield has thus put a question mark on the very sustenance of farmers.\nEach groundnut plant yields approximately 40 nuts. But this year, the number stands at just 10, and half of them unripe. The farmers can neither preserve the crop for seed purposes due to scanty rains. The crop of two-and-a-half month duration, sowed in July is yet to be harvested.\nBut, one can get only the plants but not the nuts if attempted to harvest. Meanwhile, the rain is playing truant. One cannot even depend on borewells due to erratic power supply. It was targeted to grow groundnut in 13,000 hectare of land in the khariff season. However, the crop was sown in 7,814 hectare only. The target for oil seeds was 14,985 hectare while they were sowed in 8,801 hectare only. And, groundnut constitutes major portion of the area sown.\nNow, it is targeted to grow groundnut in 35 hectare during rabi season. But now even a single step is taken in this direction. \u201cIt costs at least Rs 5,000 to sow groundnut in one hectare of land. I have incurred Rs 10,000 for sowing the crop in two-and-a-half acre of land. I would have had a bumper harvest had it rained on time.

Until they crash.\nWednesday provided one such rude awakening for commuters in Montgomery County.\nA computer meltdown disrupted the choreography of 750 traffic lights, turning the morning and evening commutes into endless seas of red brake lights, causing thousands of drivers to arrive at work grumpy and late, and getting them home more frustrated and even later.\nMontgomery County officials said they will offer free bus rides all day Thursday, a decision made Wednesday night, even as county technicians worked feverishly to resurrect the faulty machine in time for the morning rush.\n\"In case these efforts are not successful, we want to help provide commuters another option\" by providing free access to Ride On buses, County Executive Isiah Leggett said in a statement.\nOn Wednesday, commuters who thought they would slip around the chaos by detouring from their usual routes only found more problems.

Thanks to gridlock in the Senate and mounting de\ufb01cit concerns, pressure is building for reform, not elimination, of the tax. This pushback is coming from budget hawks, of\ufb01cials in states that continue to tax inherited wealth, and progressive organizing. Public opinion is shifting, as budget cuts begin to trickle down into local communities and school districts.\nUnder the federal tax cuts of 2001, the estate tax is phased out between now and 2010, with the wealth exemptions increasing from $1.5 million to $3.5 million for individuals, double for married couples. But without congressional action, the 2001 tax law will revert back to its pre-2001 provisions, a 55-percent rate and a $1 million individual wealth exemption.\nThe pressure to abolish the estate tax comes from anti-tax groups like Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, newspaper owners, and front organizations funded by America's richest clans, including the Mars candy, Gallo wine, and Wal-Mart families. America's wealthiest family channeled political contributions from Walton Enterprises and retained lobbying powerhouse Patton Boggs to advocate for the family's interests.\nBut at a time of glaring budget de\ufb01cits, Republican moderates like Senators George Voinovich and Olympia Snowe, who have supported repeal in the past, are unlikely to back complete abolition now. In response to their own dire budget situations, 18 states and the District of Columbia have voted to retain state-level estate taxes. In Washington state, a lively coalition of children's advocates and progressive Microsoft millionaires successfully lobbied the statehouse in Olympia to levy a new tax on estates over $2 million. This effort had the support of newly elected Governor Christine Gregoire.\nThe Iraq War, moreover, dramatically highlights the grotesque inequality of sacri\ufb01ce, with families of GIs having to raise money for Kevlar armor. \u201cDuring the Civil War, rich people could buy their way out of the draft,\u201d said Charlie Richardson, co-founder of Military Families Speak Out. \u201cNow the wealthy don't have to pay anything to avoid military service -- and they get big tax cuts on top.\u201d Likewise, Senator John McCain has pointed out that our country has never given tax cuts to the wealthy during a time of war.\nIn their new book about estate-tax politics, Death by a Thousand Cuts, Yale professors Michael Graetz and Ian Shapiro describe how opponents of repeal were caught \ufb02at-footed as repeal forces got a 10-year head start framing the issue as an immoral \u201cdeath tax.\u201d They describe how repeal advocates successfully characterized the estate tax as a tax on the \u201cworking rich,\u201d hosting family farmers and business owners to testify before Congress, even though many weren't rich enough to ever owe any tax at all.\nGraetz and Shapiro's advice to opponents of repeal: Refocus the \ufb01ght as a question about the immorality of unlimited and undeserved inheritances. \u201cCall it the \u2018Paris Hilton Bene\ufb01t Act,'\u201d suggested Graetz. Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota and lead sponsor of the House reform proposal, suggests linking the revenue from the estate tax to the long-term stabilization of Social Security.\nThere's strong support in the Senate for maintaining some form of estate tax. The coming debate will be over what constitutes \u201cresponsible reform.\u201d Here's one formula: By raising exemptions to $2 million for individuals and $4 million for a couple, we could preserve almost 68 percent of the revenue, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. A more progressive rate structure, with lower rates on estates under $5 million and higher rates on estates over $20 million, would raise comparable revenue to the existing law.\nA progressive reform could achieve one of the inheritance tax's original goals from its 1916 origins in the Progressive Era: to raise revenue from those most able to pay and break up swollen concentrations of wealth and power that threaten our democracy. Without a progressive inheritance tax, our own grandchildren will be working to earn dividends for the Walton grandchildren for many years to come.\nWatch out Grover -- that \ufb01sh might just \ufb02op back in the water.\nChuck Collins is the co-founder and associate director of United for a Fair Economy and the co-founder of Responsible Wealth, which recenctly advocated for estate-tax reform. He is the co-author, with Bill Gates Sr., of Wealth and Our Commonwealth: Why America Should Tax Accumulated Fortunes.", "Wall Street analysts reacted to the Securities and Exchange Commission's motion filed Monday evening that directed a federal judge to hold Tesla CEO Elon Musk in contempt of court over a tweet.\n\"Another boxing match with the SEC is the last thing investors wanted to see,\" one analyst said.\nTesla shares fell in pre-market trading Tuesday.\nWall Street analysts covering Tesla weighed in Tuesday on the Securities and Exchange Commission's motion filed against Elon Musk, the electric-car maker's CEO, regarding a tweet.\nThe agency directed a federal judge to hold Musk in contempt of court over a tweet Musk posted last week, saying it violated the terms of his settlement in the wake of his infamous \"funding secured\" tweet last year.\nLast week, Musk tweeted Tesla would produce 500,000 cars this year before walking back his claim in a follow-up tweet.\n\"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week,\" he wrote. \"Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.\"\nUnder Tesla's settlement with the SEC, Tesla was supposed to preaprrove all of Musk's shareholder communication that included \"material\" information about the company - like production numbers.\nSeveral analysts said that while it would difficult to determine the outcome right now, the motion was the last thing investors needed amid management departures and a renewed focus on ramping up Model 3 production for China and Europe. With the motion acting as a wild card and a distraction, analysts said shares could come under pressure, though many didn't adjust their price targets or investment recommendations on the news.\nTesla shares fell about 3% early Tuesday.\n\"In our opinion another boxing match with the SEC is the last thing investors wanted to see last night as Tesla is already in such a pivotal period with Musk & Co. trying to ramp up Model 3 production/demand for China/Europe, and thread the needle to profitability with roughly $1.5 billion of debt to be paid this year,\" analyst Daniel Ives told clients in a note out Tuesday.\nHe added he'd be watching the courts' next steps in the coming days, as the development will prove to be a near-term overhang on shares until investors can \"better gauge the impact.\"\nStill, the firm reiterated its \"outperform\" rating and bullish price target due to its view that the electric-car maker's demand can improve this year.\n\"Should the SEC again seek to remove Mr. Musk, we estimate TSLA shares could approach but perhaps not breach 52-week lows,\" analysts led by Ryan Brinkman wrote to clients Tuesday.\n\"The SEC is requesting the Court find Mr. Musk in contempt, but did not on Monday request any specific remedy. In particular, it has not requested to set aside the earlier settlement which led to the withdrawal of securities fraud charges and its request Mr. Musk be barred from serving as an officer of any public company, including Tesla.\"\nThat's what the analysts view as a \"worst case scenario,\" the likelihood of which is difficult to judge at this point.\nIf the SEC were to seek Musk's removal, the analysts wrote, shares may approach - though not retest - the mid-$200 levels seen in the aftermath of the suit over Musk's infamous \"funding secured\" tweet.\n\"It will be up to a federal judge to determine whether Musk is in contempt and what the penalties would be (or the SEC and Musk would have to reach a settlement),\" analyst Joseph Spak wrote to clients Tuesday.\n\"We won't opine on the ruling potential. But in our opinion, given that the SEC arguably let Musk off lightly for his first settlement, and given that he has taunted the SEC (see the 60 Minutes interview [December 9, 2018] during which he stated, 'I don't respect the SEC'), we believe the SEC will seek a harsher penalty/settlement.\"\nSpak said he is again reminded of the \"seemingly inadequate corporate governance at Tesla in this regard.\"\n\"Based on our understanding, we do not think there may be material risk of a change to Mr Musk's role at Tesla,\" analysts Maynard Um and Tim Liu wrote to clients Tuesday.\n\"The bottom line is that the SEC is looking for strict enforcement of the policy, which we believe ultimately will be dictated by Mr Musk rather than the Board.\"\n\"Recall that our Tesla downgrade last year (to Sell/High Risk) came right after the SEC's original actions against Tesla,\" analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a report on Tuesday. \"We view this escalation as a negative and expect Tesla shares to come under pressure at least until some clarity is achieved.\"\nMichaeli said while the motion's outcome could plausibly range from nothing of material impact to Musk's removal, it's difficult to predict.\nThe escalation comes at a particularly delicate time for the company after recent management departures, including the company's CFO, he added.\nAP Photo/Steven Senne A Wall Street bank just started covering 7 marijuana stocks. Here's what it's saying.", "Nexthink Co-Founder and Board Member, overseeing technology and product positioning and roadmap. Coach and board member at various startups.\nIn order for employees to get their jobs done in today\u2019s world, they are relying on IT departments to deliver and support more complex and diverse technologies than ever before. It seems like every employee has their own preferred workflow that is supported by a specific data set, program, app or device, and IT is expected to understand and support them all. The sheer volume, variety and velocity of these technology choices puts a significant burden on IT teams and stifles their success and ability to drive true business-wide ROI. How can IT departments provide the proper technology while also ensuring, and properly measuring, a digital experience that allows end users to be effective without opening the floodgates for IT?\nThe answer lies in understanding the three imperatives for IT leaders when it comes to providing and supporting the digital workplace that today\u2019s employees require. These imperatives are the data foundation, end user expectations and engagement directive.\nImproving the digital experience for employees demands better data. Critically, it demands a foundation built on complete infrastructure context because employee environments are now very personalized, informed as much by personal and social preference as business needs and expectations. This means that everything -- from mobile devices to commonly used applications, printers, network proxies and browser plug-ins -- exists in a space somewhere between corporate control and employee independence.\nTo actively enhance the user experience while also ensuring device performance and system security, companies need to know exactly what\u2019s installed, used, modified, patched and configured on their network (on a per-user basis) all the time, whether it's on-premise or in the cloud. Here\u2019s why: Without both clear endpoint data and active infrastructure monitoring, any attempt to streamline services or fix issues will be out of sync with user experience, potentially causing more problems than it solves.\nWhereas users may not care, IT absolutely needs to know why technology isn\u2019t working properly. To meet evolving employee expectations, IT needs to know why PCs are suddenly booting slowly or not performing as expected, or why apps are randomly crashing. It\u2019s no longer enough to tell users their problem will \u201ceventually\u201d be fixed as teams work through ticket queues. Instead, IT is responsible in these situations to keep staff happy and productive, and in order to do so, IT teams need an inside track on contextual experience.\nHowever, understanding the situation doesn\u2019t make it easy. The sheer number of services and staff make it impossible for IT teams to stay ahead of person-specific issues using traditional monitor-and-ticket responses. Instead, they need tools capable of observing user behavior, contextualizing immediate problems and implementing effective remedies, eventually leveraging automation to proactively take action without the need of a human operator -- such as changing configurations, installing new software or updating drivers -- to solve small problems before they become large issues. Put simply? The addition of subjective understanding and proactive response to contextual data is more than the sum of its parts.\nUser sentiment analysis: How do users perceive their current digital experience? How does it match with technical performance?\nSelf-healing and repair: Using a combination of contextual analysis and traditional performance monitoring, tools must empower IT to address immediate issues with user feedback in mind; they should be fully automated or offer a simple and fast resolution action.\nSelf-help: This includes the creation of free IT resources to solve common problems and is especially effective when paired with proactive solutions and improvement recommendations.\nVerification feedback loop: Did fixes address specific issues? Are users satisfied? Based on what I\u2019ve seen from our customers, on average, 10% of all closed support tickets are never resolved; they\u2019re simply closed. DEM solutions must empower IT to follow up with employees about their continued experience.\nThe workplace has changed forever, and users now demand a digital experience beyond what any IT team had dreamed of. In order to be successful, IT must recognize that existing metrics aren\u2019t enough. It\u2019s time to bridge the gap by establishing a firm data foundation, exceeding user expectations and continuously improving employee engagement.", "Don't Torpedo The Dam, Full Speed Ahead For Ethiopia's Nile Project : Goats and Soda Egypt was ready to go to war over Ethiopia's planned Renaissance Dam. A new agreement has ended the tension. But that doesn't mean everyone's a winner.\nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is under construction near Assosa, Ethiopia. When it's completed, the dam will have be able to produce 6,000 megawatts of electricity, making it the biggest hydroelectric power station in Africa.\nI once met a popular spoken word poet in Ethiopia who was asked by a government official to write a poem about the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. (He politely explained that he didn't do poetry about infrastructure.) But it's not surprising that Ethiopia would like to inscribe this dam into the Ethiopian epic.\nWhen completed, the Renaissance Dam promises to be the largest hydro-electric project in Africa. Funded without help from America or the West, the \"renaissance\" in the dam's title refers to a 70-year-old vision of Africa rising on the strength of its own abundant resources. Independence and self-reliance in the so-called \"dark continent\" begins with electricity.\nBut since Ethiopia began construction in 2011, Egypt has spun the dam as a threat. Egypt's way of life depends on the Nile River. Former president Mohammed Morsi once warned that every drop of water stolen from the Nile would be defended by a drop of Egyptian blood.\nIn fact, a hydropower dam doesn't steal water from downstream. It only draws power from its flow. Except during one crucial period: just after the dam is built and the reservoir is filled. A reservoir this huge will hold 63 billion cubic meters \u2014 roughly as much water as Egypt gets from the Nile over the course of a year. If the basin were to be filled too fast, Egypt's farmers would plunge into drought and its own hydropower dams would stop producing electricity.\nFear of that scenario is why Egypt's former president almost went to war with Ethiopia over the dam.\nInstead, on Monday, Egypt's current president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn signed a \"Declaration of Principles\" with Sudan's president as broker. Egypt approved the project and will have rights to some of the electricity that will be generated. The key negotiations to come will be over the pace of filling that giant reservoir when it's completed in the next few years. Fast enough to satisfy Ethiopia's grand ambitions but slow enough not to hobble Egypt's economy.\nAaron Wolf, a professor of geography and trained mediator who runs the Program in Water Conflict Management and Transformation at Oregon State University, says that once the reservoir is filled, the long term impact of the Renaissance Dam will be less to Egypt than to traditional Ethiopian tribes who will lose access to the river they depend upon for fishing or mining.\n\"Like all big dams, there are going to be impacts,\" he says. \"But if all things were equal, you do want [to build] your dams upstream.\"\nNegotiators for both sides will have to overcome centuries of conflict and distrust. Ethiopia rightly complains that colonial-era water treaties gave Egypt a virtual monopoly over Nile waters. Geography has also played its role. Wolf notes that \"downstream\" countries like Egypt tend to develop first, because that's where the flat plains and agricultural land is, while upstream countries like Ethiopia are generally more hilly and later to develop. Then when those upstream countries develop, they have a downstream impact. \"That chronology is fairly common,\" Wolf says, from water conflicts in China, to Tajikistan, to Laos.\nEven more common, of course, is the distrust that accompanies all water disputes. \"I grew up in San Francisco and I grew up resenting Southern California for their incessant water needs,\" Wolf says. \"But the corollary to that is that water also brings people into a room who wouldn't normally sit in a room together. So it brings Arabs and Israelis together, Egyptians and Ethiopians, Northern California and Southern California.\"\nWhen it comes to water, even the bitterest rivals eventually end up having to take up arms or negotiate. Two powerful African economies, Egypt and Ethiopia, have moved a step toward the latter.", "Boucheron, 164 New Bond Street, London W1 (020-7514 9170; www.boucheron.com).

Van Cleef & Arpels, 9 New Bond Street, London W1 (020-7493 0400; www.vancleefarpels.com).\nThe fascination of an inanimate object that suddenly moves by complex, hidden means exerts a spell, appealing to the child in us all. We may know it is a matter of wheels and gears, but we suspend disbelief to enjoy the magic. Witness the faces of visitors to the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg on days when the Peacock Clock, created in the 1770s, is set going. Or those at Corpus Christi College in Cambridge watching John Taylor\u2019s 2008 sculptural clock with its \u201ctime-eating\u201d metal grasshopper escapement. Imagine the joy of such a thing in miniature on your wrist.\nAs sales of women\u2019s luxury mechanical watches have increased by 15 per cent in five years, brands are creating more complex designs aimed at eliciting wonder and emotion. The trend started in 2006 when Bos, then creative director at Van Cleef & Arpels, introduced its Poetic Complications range with the Lady Arpels Centenaire, a watch that tells a romantic story through a highly crafted dial and a custom-built movement. Bos turned to watchmaker Jean-Marc Wiederrecht, who has a surprisingly poetic approach for someone whose working life revolves around micro-mathematical precision. For this first model Bos wanted to mark the seasons with a watch that would revolve slowly over the year. \u201cThis needed a very complex movement that risked being too big and heavy, but Jean-Marc perfected it,\u201d he says. The dial\u2019s almost imperceptible motion is highlighted by a miniature painting in polychrome enamel to represent the changing seasons.\nOther \u201cstories\u201d include the bestselling Pont des Amoureux (\u00a3104,100), featuring a couple meeting on a bridge and connecting for a kiss at the stroke of midnight, courtesy of Wiederrecht\u2019s specially designed retrograde movement. He has since gone on to other projects but the brand\u2019s newest model, Ronde des Papillons (\u00a3106,700), puts even greater emphasis on effects created by the movement. Three layers of stylised mother-of-pearl clouds sit on a soft-blue dial and through them weave three brilliant enamelled butterflies, each marking different parts of the hour, while a deep-blue swallow indicates the hour itself with its wingtip. Press a button and the butterflies take flight to complete their full course in the space of 13 seconds \u2013 normal timing will then resume with total accuracy. The watch is not a limited edition, though each is numbered and is long in the making, meaning only a few are available. The cost factor often makes automata self-limiting, and therefore rare.\nA simpler but not dissimilar movement to that in Ronde des Papillons, also designed by Wiederrecht, powers Herm\u00e8s\u2019 Arceau Le Temps Suspendu, on which a button can be pushed to disengage the hands; it\u2019s a \u201csecret moment\u201d causing time \u2013 on your watch at least \u2013 to stand still. Press it again and the hands will return to the correct time. The story is the movement rather than decoration and so the beauty is in the watch\u2019s simplicity, whether in steel (\u00a313,200) or rose gold with diamonds (\u00a327,100).\nWiederrecht\u2019s latest projects are with revived brand Faberg\u00e9, which seeks inspiration in the Russian jeweller\u2019s original work. Last year it introduced the Lady Compliqu\u00e9e Peacock in white mother-of-pearl \u2013 based on a 1908 Faberg\u00e9 Easter egg \u2013 with a unique movement: a peacock\u2019s tail feathers unfurl one by one, to different degrees, to indicate the minutes, and the hours are read off a rotating outer disc. New versions are gemset with rubies (\u00a372,656), emeralds or black sapphires and have mother-of-pearl or onyx dials. They are, says timepieces director Aur\u00e9lie Picaud, \u201ca true collaboration \u2013 we explain our concept and inspiration to Jean-Marc and his team brainstorms the movement with new innovations\u201d. The new Lady Levity (from \u00a317,150) is based on a Faberg\u00e9 rock-crystal desk clock that featured a man-in-the-moon motif. The central decoration can be personalised with a secret image that is printed in platinum, finished with mother-of-pearl and then set under a domed sapphire crystal to create a ghostly image that is visible only at certain angles.\nThese pieces are a kind of animated jewel, says Wiederrecht. \u201cPrecious materials and the skills of making the automata give them legacy value, which a quartz movement suppresses because of its short life expectancy.\u201d He finds women are increasingly intrigued by such mechanisms. \u201cAesthetics are important but women also appreciate the beauty of mechanical movements done to the highest standards,\u201d he says. Add the gem-setting expertise of a high-end jewellery house and it\u2019s a winning combination.\nCartier\u2019s love of panthers now extends to a poetic creation \u2013 the Panth\u00e8res et Colibri (\u00a3177,000), which features a white gold and diamond panther and a golden hummingbird: press the crown and an engraved gold panther cub appears from behind its parent, chases the bird in a trajectory and the distance flown indicates the remaining power reserve. Boucheron\u2019s sapphire Khepri \u00e0 Secret (price on request) transforms from scarab-beetle bracelet to watch with the mechanical lift of carved mother-of\u2011pearl wings. Chaumet\u2019s Hortensia Astres d\u2019Or (\u00a3130,560) features a formal dance of enamelled, diamond and pink sapphire hydrangea flowers indicating the time, while the winged beauties of Graff\u2019s diamond Disco Butterfly (price on request) turn and dance on a bed of gems, with options including emeralds or Para\u00edba tourmalines.\nThough a watch\u2019s tourbillon function is to increase timekeeping accuracy, the movement itself is fascinating to observe and brands are adding beautiful details to draw attention to its intricacy. To create the delicate, white-gold rotating camellia on the Premi\u00e8re Flying Tourbillon Openwork, Chanel called on top independent watchmaker Renaud et Papi and the model has proved so successful that new versions are launched each year. The latest edition (\u00a3243,000) of eight adds blackened gold openwork housed in a beige gold case and trimmed with chic baguette diamonds.\nBulgari enjoys an unrivalled combination of Swiss watchmaking and Italian jewel craft and increasingly employs these skills to create surprising women\u2019s watches. Its Berries models frame the tourbillon with textured gold and coloured stones, creating a veritable layer cake \u2013 the hands glide below the jewels, in a tiny space above the tourbillon. For the newest version, the Berries Bi-Retrograde Tourbillon (\u00a3118,000), director of watch design Fabrizio Buonamassa wanted the tourbillon uncluttered by the hands. \u201cThe hour hand would take several hours to pass, which is not so elegant,\u201d he says. Instead it has a mechanism so that when the hour hand reaches six, it flies back up to 12 and then down to another figure six on the lefthand side of the tourbillon, before continuing as normal; the slender minute hand passes through quickly, scarcely affecting the view. He has also redesigned the oval-faced Serpenti for its first round version (\u00a3142,000). The openwork tourbillon, its bridges modelled on serpent coils, draws the eye, yet the surprise is the flexible, tactile tail of trapezoid diamonds.", "LITTLE ROCK \ufffd Lawmakers this week will take up legislation to rewrite the state's stricken death-penalty law as opponents of capital punishment draw new encouragement from Gov.

A recent study in California found that over a lifetime, an inmate on death row costs more than $1 million more than an inmate serving a life sentence without parole, he said.\n\ufffdThese are not small numbers, they are significant savings we could have if we did away with the death penalty,\ufffd Kooistra said.\nKooistra said he appreciated the motivation behind the Hester\ufffds bill to allow victims\ufffd relatives to witness executions but opposes it because he believes the state could spend the savings from dropping the death penalty to assist the family of victims and reduce crime.\n\ufffdIf we\ufffdre really interested in helping a victim\ufffds family \ufffd a smarter, better use of resources would be to do away with the death penalty and fold those savings into things like counseling services for the victims, or throw (the savings) into law enforcement, crime prevention, social services, education, things that prevent crimes from happening in the first place,\ufffd Kooistra said.\nIn a recent appearance before the Political Animals Club, Beebe was asked about a hypothetical bill banning capital punishment.

He turned and let loose a controlled shot that left Leigh standing.\nBarwell could have gone further ahead on the quarter hour after a Malcolm Melvin corner had Jamie Towers challenging Leigh under his bar but the ball deflected over the bar.\nFrickley responded immediately through Matt Young who drove a Reece Thompson cross past the post from 18 yards.\nOn the half hour Frickley again ventured forward but this time the league\u2019s top scorer Gavin Allott, who was through on goal, sliced his shot past Liam Castle\u2019s post.\nThe visitors responded though Melvin who found himself in the box with a shooting chance. He sidefooted goalwards but Leigh was able to palm the ball over the bar.\nShortly before half time Thompson beat the offside trap and looked to be heading for goal but Eddie Nisevic was alert to the danger and did well to marshal the ball out for a corner.\nBarwell ended the half resilient at the back as Frickley pushed for an equaliser. A flurry of activity in the Barwell box saw at least five shots with five excellent blocks from the visiting defence.\nEarly in the second period Frickley drew level.

He showed for gigs, smiled pleasantly, did his job and then he was gone.\nAll who knew him agree that Johnny Rebb was truthfully billed as the \"Gentleman of Rock 'n' Roll\". He was forever polite, modest and sober. He rarely raised his voice or swore. He thanked fans for asking for his autograph.\nSinger: Johnny Rebb writes songs from his hospital bed in Sydney on 18 August 1962.\nIf contrary depths festered behind the niceness, they remained hidden. As did Rebb whenever he wasn't working. He showed for rehearsals, recordings and gigs, smiled pleasantly, did his job and then he was gone.\nToday he is remembered for being one step behind Johnny O'Keefe and Col Joye as a seminal 1950s rock 'n' roller. Then, in the mid-'60s he set the standard for Australian indie rock.\nThe Atlantics: Jim Skiathitis, Johnny Rebb, Theo Penglis, Bosco Bosanac, Peter Hood.\nJohnny Rebb was born Donald James Delbridge on March 20, 1939. He became an apprentice butcher and moonlighted as a Country & Western singer. In 1955 he saw the film Blackboard Jungle and was converted to rock 'n' roll by Rock Around The Clock.\nHis vocal range suited rock. He could growl, shout, sob and croon. He cut a swathe through local talent quests and soon had a manager, Syd McDonagh. Syd set about finding Delbridge a band, a record contract and a stage name.\nHe approached ace keyboard player/music arranger John Charter to form the band. Charter agreed, if a record contract was in the offing. Ken Taylor from Festival Records passed on a contract but supplied the name Johnny Rebb, based on Johnny Reb, the name for Confederate soldiers in America's civil war.\nEMI expressed interest, John Charter arranged a stride piano version of Johnny B Goode. It wasn't a hit but promoter Lee Gordon noticed and signed Rebb to his Leedon label. Charter rearranged the country ditty Hey Sheriff as belting rock and suddenly Johnny Rebb and The Rebels were on the charts and on national tour with one of Lee Gordon's many Parades of Stars.\n\"We did a dozen Lee Gordon shows,\" said Charter. \"For two years the hits kept coming and the screaming never stopped. There was Johnny O'Keefe, Col Joye, us, Johnny Devlin and Dig Richards. We were the Big Five of Australian rock.\"\nThe Rebels were killer musicians. They should have been famous in their own right but McDonagh kept them under wraps.\n\"Our first recording session,\" said John Charter, \"Johnny O'Keefe stole Bob Birtles, our sax player. That made Syd very suspicious of losing us. He never passed on offers for us to record by ourselves or to back other artists.\"\nCharter was further disenchanted when he got a writing credit, but no royalties, for Rebb's biggest hit, Pathway To Paradise.\nOne by one the Rebels slipped away. In 1960, Charter turned up for a recording session to find jazz supremos Don Burrows and George Golla on hand, but The Rebels absent. The song, Think Me A Kiss, was Rebb's last hit and the last time Charter played with him.\nRebb relocated to America where he recorded and played but gained no traction. He and Syd returned in 1964, again in search of a band. They found The Atlantics, who'd won international recognition for their surf instrumental, Bombora.\n\"We were playing a rock festival in Lane Cove National Park,\" said Bosco Bascano, The Atlantics bass player. \"Syd McDonagh asked us to back Johnny. Afterwards he suggested we join forces.\"\nThe union resulted in a series of indie singles now regarded as classics. Most exceptional was Come On, which now sells for over $1000.\nNot far behind in price or status is the Rebb/Atlantics' thunderous I Put A Spell On You, which made Top 30 on the Australian chart.\n\"We played shows and Johnny tore the place apart,\" said Bosco. \"But everything was stacked against indie bands. Radio didn't want to know. We couldn't get good distribution. We had to fight to get good pressings.\"\nRebb and The Atlantics called it a day in 1970. Rebb continued solo till 1976.

You make mountains out of molehills and become convinced that this one brief rough patch will be the demise of your entire career and reputation.\nRest assured, that\u2019s hardly ever the case\u2013and this question will help you step back and get some much-needed perspective. Of course, there will be some days that had so much go wrong they will require some further action to patch things up.\nBut most of the time? You\u2019ll be able to start fresh tomorrow morning without any sort of ill effects from the previous day. So chin up! More likely than not, everything that happened today probably won\u2019t matter too much next year (or even the next day).\n2. What would I do differently?\nAre you the eternal winner of the blame game? I can relate. When things don\u2019t work out as planned, it\u2019s easy to place all of the responsibility on your shoulders\u2013regardless of whether you had any control over those circumstances or not.\nThis is why it can be so helpful to identify what, if anything, you\u2019d do differently if you magically had a do-over of your day.\nNot only will you be able to show yourself some grace and quit blaming yourself for things you had nothing to do with (really, what power did you have over your train being late?), but you\u2019ll also learn from any mistakes you actually did make\u2013and then avoid doing them in the future.\n3. What went well today?\nAlright, you\u2019re so wrapped up in everything that went wrong that you\u2019re convinced today was so terrible it\u2019s worthy of being the plot of a horror film. However, even the worst days have at least a few bright spots.\nObsessing over the bad things is probably only going to send your mood into more of a nosedive. So, ask yourself this question to pull out a few of the positives. Even if it\u2019s something as small as the fact that you got your favorite bagel sandwich for lunch or your colleague complimented your haircut, think of the things that actually went right today (trust me, there are a few of them!). It\u2019s a great way to put those negative things behind you and boost your mood.\nUnfortunately, bad days are inescapable every now and then. They can be frustrating and emotionally trying, but they can also be enlightening.\nBefore you park yourself on your couch and drown your sorrows for the evening, take the time to think through these three key questions\u2013and you\u2019ll be back up and at \u2019em in no time.\nThis article originally appeared on The Muse and is reprinted with permission.", "Tim Dwight of the Indian Harbour Beach gourmet market picked the best wines he's tasted this year that are priced between $50 and $15.\nOnce again it is my pleasure to dig deep into the viniferous memory banks and come up with 10 truly memorable wines from the past 12 months.\nThis year\u2019s Top 10 list features a wide array of critical selections from Napa and Sonoma as well as France, Italy and Spain. Designed to offer suggestions for most every wine drinker on your Holiday list, these bottles range in price from $15 to $50. A votre sant\u00e9!\nNapa Valley winemaker Scott Palazzo is at the top of his game with this sumptuous, full-bodied blend of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot. As a young man, Palazzo interned for two years in Bordeaux\u2019s St. Emilion, so it\u2019s no surprise that the grapes that put that bucolic French wine village on the map are the same varietals that Scott works with back home in Napa.\nA smooth and creamy large-scaled red that packs a serious punch, Palazzo\u2019s Cuvee Red is a special treat for steak night with friends or family.\nWhite wines from Bordeaux are often overshadowed by the success of their red brethren and in truth make up only a small proportion of that region\u2019s total production. But white varietals can excel in cooler vintages, and the \u201914 Carbonnieux is a fine testament of that. A blend of 75 percent sauvignon blanc and 25 percent semillon, this zesty white wine is vibrant and energetic with nuances of lime, white florals and chalky minerality. Pair with seafood, chicken or veal.\nThe first of two red Italians to crack our Top 10 this year, winemaker Rita Tua has fashioned a unique identity for this 100 percent sangiovese from Tuscany. The winery produces a full range of viniferous high points, but Perlato del Bosco gets top nod for it\u2019s affordable, medium-bodied styling. Black raspberries, cherries and candied orange peel complement generous accents of rose petals and vanilla. A match made in pasta heaven.\nLong-time Santa Barbara resident Scott Jaffurs recently sold his property to veteran winemaker Dan Green, but it appears all is well in this hotbed of oft-overlooked syrah. A flat-out delicious bottle of red wine with cherry and plum fruit flavors, the \u201915 is sourced from some of the Central Coast\u2019s finest boutique vineyards. A special treat with game or barbecued ribs.\nWith its iconic tattooed sailor\u2019s label, this not-quite-usual-in-a-good-way Napa cab is all toasted oak and ripe berries, saddle leather and bass notes of coffee beans and mocha. Moderate tannins allow for structure and a long finish. Enjoy this big boy with roasted meats and burgers.\nOne of the advantages of getting to know the wines of Rioja is the extended aging most bottles routinely undergo before being released. Witness the current \u201909 vintage of this mature Rioja, 100 percent tempranillo, from the redoubtable Allende wine team, a classic study in finesse and elegance rather than overt power. Jamon ham or paella would go nicely.\nPretty much any bottling of fine Burgundy is going to be a small-scale production given the numbers, and this red pinot from the tiny, walled plot (monopole) of Clos De Meixvelle is a case in point. It is light-to-medium bodied, with fine, smooth tannins and well-integrated oak, flavors of cherry-vanilla and dried spice-box herbs. Serve with duck breast or lightly spiced meats.\nThe peripatetic winemaker Paul Hobbs regularly consults with projects from Chile and Argentina up to New York\u2019s Finger Lakes and back home to Sonoma County. An overwhelming task for most winemakers but a usual day at the office for Hobbs. His Crossbarn label is always a great source of wines that don\u2019t make it into his pricey single-vineyard offerings. Pair this full-bodied pinot with lamb chops, duck or barbecue. (Retail $30-$35).\nPrivilegia is a reserve-style red blend from the Verona region featuring cabernet franc and native corvina (Amarone) grapes. A viniferous French-Italian styled hybrid, this unusual red is aged for two years in oak and an additional six months in bottle. It\u2019s a knockout, full-bodied, rich and elegant and not quite like anything else you\u2019ve tasted lately. Serve with full-flavored Italian foods.\nSouthern France\u2019s vast Languedoc region is another overlooked source of fine values for both red and white wines. \u201cLa Brise Marine\u201d translates as \u201cthe sea breeze\u201d and there\u2019s a distinct notion of salty minerality along with notes of lemon peel, chamomile and peaches in this off-beat though inexpensive white blend of roussanne and bourboulenc grapes. Fresh, lively acidity accentuates the food-friendly styling; a dreamy pairing with shellfish or seafood.\nDwight is a dertified wine educator, sommelier and wine writer as well as proprietor of the Green Turtle Market in Indian Harbour Beach.", "Rationalisation of reserve prices in the ongoing spectrum auction helped the government to get Rs 40,000 crore of bids on the opening day, Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal said today.\n\"We took the bold step of rationalising reserve prices and on the first day itself you have bids worth Rs 40,000 crore,\" Sibal said on the sidelines of a function to launch cloud computing services for public departments.\nThe government set a pan-India rate of Rs 1,765 crore per MHz as the start price for spectrum in the 1800 MHz band, which is about 26 per cent lower than the base rate in the March 2013 sale, where there were no takers for GSM airwaves.\nFor the 900 MHz band, it approved a rate that is about 53 per cent lower than the March auction price.\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had recommended a minimum price of Rs 18,000 crore for 5 MHz of pan-India spectrum in the 2012 auction, Sibal had said at the time.\nThis followed the Supreme Court order of February 2012, asking for the procedure in the 3G auction to be followed.\nHowever, even after the government cut the recommended reserve price to Rs 14,000 crore, the November 2012 auction ended in two days, with bids of about Rs 9,407 crore received for airwaves worth Rs 28,000 crore.\n\"If you have an irrational reserve price, the market will not be attractive. I have been saying that. Now people should realise how irrational it was at that point in time for media and everybody to shout that the government is losing revenue,\" Sibal said.\nA report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, which was tabled in Parliament in November 2010, pegged the revenue loss to the exchequer on account of allocation of 2G spectrum in 2008 at Rs 1.76 lakh crore.\nThe controversy over the spectrum allocation also led to cancellation of 122 licences by the Supreme Court in 2012.\nIn the current auction, eight firms, including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and new entrant Reliance Jio Infocomm, are in the fray.\nThe government received bids of about Rs 39,300 crore at the end of the first day yesterday, according to Telecom Secretary MF Farooqui.\n\"I just think that may be we got it right, that's all,\" Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Chairman Rahul Khullar said without elaborating when asked to comment on the response to the auction.\nTRAI had suggested a pan-India reserve price in the 1800 MHz band that was 37 per cent lower than the March 2013 auction. For the 900 MHz band, it had recommended a base price that was up to 62 per cent lower.\nBids of about Rs 23,000 crore were received for spectrum in the 1800 MHz band, another Department of Telecom official said.\nThe remaining bids were received for the premium 900 MHz band spectrum, which allows mobile signals to cover about twice the area of the 1800 MHz band and requires lower operational expenses.\nEven if bidders opt to pay the final auction price in instalments, the government will get at least Rs 11,590 crore, exceeding the target of collecting Rs 11,343 crore in upfront payments.\n\"This is a matter of great satisfaction that a sector which was in difficulty, working in an environment that was exceptionally negative, we have turned it around,\" Sibal said.\nYou will continue to see it as the goose that lays golden eggs, he said.\nThe ninth round of the current spectrum auction ended at 12.30 pm today with high demand for the 900 MHz band in Delhi and Mumbai, while there was excess demand for 2G spectrum in Gujarat, Maharashtra and UP West, according to industry sources.\nThe information could not be officially confirmed.", "The right criticized Janet Yellen for years. Now the left says she\u2019s too far right.\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to continue hiking interest rates from the ultralow levels they were at during and after the financial crisis might seem like a no-brainer. Interest rates are low by historical standards. And except for a few recent hiccups, the U.S. economy appears to be humming along, with stronger global growth laying a smooth path for its future.\nYet the Fed\u2019s decision to raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday was, for the first time in a long time, met with some dissent. After years of being criticized by those on the right for keeping interest rates too low, Fed chair Janet L. Yellen is finally seeing criticism, much of it from the more dovish left, for pushing rates too high.\nThe Fed is charged with balancing two basic responsibilities. On one hand, it needs to ensure interest rates are low enough that the labor market is strong and almost all Americans who want a job can find one. On the other, it needs to make sure that rates are high enough to restrain rapid increases in prices, which can have a devastating effect on savers, creditors and the economy.\nThe current economy, however, presents something of a puzzle. The jobs market looks solid. The unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low in May \u2014 a suggestion that the Fed has fulfilled the first part of its goal, jobs, and should shift its focus to the second, restraining inflation. Yet measures of price growth remain stubbornly below the level that the Fed targets.\nSome economists argue that inflation is just lagging, and will rear its head soon. They believe that the Fed should act now \u2014 because if it doesn't, it might have to raise interest rates more quickly later to offset inflation, and that could be far more damaging to the economy. They also point out that hiking rates now gives the Fed more space to cut rates later to stimulate the economy in case of a downturn.\nYet others believe the time just hasn\u2019t come to raise interest rates.\nOn Friday, Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Fed and a former Republican candidate for governor of California, took the somewhat nontraditional step of publishing remarks online about why he had voted against the rest of his colleagues and the interest rate hike, for the second time in just three months. In a post on Medium, he argued that inflation remains much lower than the Fed\u2019s target, and that it doesn\u2019t show signs of picking up much soon.\nThat also was the position of a left-leaning group called Fed Up, which on Monday assembled protesters in three cities to urge the Fed to delay its rate hike and more fundamentally rethink the way it sets its policy. The group argued that by raising interest rates and thus the cost of borrowing, the Fed\u2019s rate hike would end up hurting disadvantaged workers, especially African Americans, Hispanics and rural residents.\nIt's unusual criticism for Janet L. Yellen, a labor economist by training who has sometimes been criticized \u2014 including by Congressional Republicans and President Trump, at least before he came into office \u2014 for keeping interest rates too low.\nFed Up argues that by keeping interest rates low and letting the economy run hotter, the Fed could help disadvantaged groups with traditionally high levels of unemployment find jobs and get wage increases. As the economy continues to expand and more workers get good jobs, employers have to broaden the pool of labor they are considering and offer wage increases to attract workers. Low interest rates also help debtors \u2014 traditionally low-income groups \u2014 at the expense of Wall Street creditors.\nYellen's past comments show she understands the value for disadvantaged groups of getting to a robust economy. Yet she and other economists have also argued that Fed interest rate policy is too blunt of a tool to target specific groups, and that the task is better left to government policy.\nTara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the jobs site Indeed.com, adds that it\u2019s not clear that the winners of a hot economy would ultimately be workers. While a strong economy generally gives workers more bargaining power over their employers, there might be something else going on \u2014 such as the decline of unions, or globalization and the growing power of multinational companies \u2013 that is reducing the bargaining power of American workers.\nWith the exception of Kashkari, the Fed didn\u2019t express much hesitation about this week\u2019s rate hike. Members of the Fed's open market committee, which set interest rates, continued to forecast another rate hike this year and three more rate hikes each in 2018 and 2019. Markets will be watching closely to see whether further low inflation and wage growth readings could alter this schedule.\nIn the news conference Wednesday, however, Yellen defended the Fed\u2019s policy of gradual rate hikes as forestalling a situation that could be much more damaging for disadvantaged groups.", "Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison has denied allegations of domestic violence after an ex-partner and her son wrote on social media that the prominent Democrat had abused her.\nIn a Saturday night Facebook post, Austin Monahan said he had seen a video of Ellison \"dragging\" his mother, Karen Monahan, off a bed while screaming obscenities at her.\nAustin Monahan also wrote that he had read text messages in which Ellison would engage in \"victim shaming,\" would \"bully his mother,\" and would \"threaten her if she went public.\"\nOn Sunday, Karen Monahan, who works as an organizer with the Sierra Club, tweeted that her son's Facebook post was \"true.\"\nEllison, who is leaving his seat in Congress and currently running for state attorney general in Minnesota, denied the allegations.\nThe lawmaker and his staff did not respond to BuzzFeed News' requests for comment Sunday. BuzzFeed News has also reached out to Austin and Karen Monahan for confirmation and further details.\nOn Sunday, Minnesota state Rep. Debra Hilstrom, who is running against Ellison for state attorney general, called on Ellison to \"answer these allegations\" on Twitter.\nThe Minnesota primary is set for Tuesday, Aug. 14.\n\"I am so proud of my son for his courage. But this situation impacted me,\" Karen Monahan wrote on Twitter Saturday night, after her son had published his post on Facebook. \"If you have anything to say, please say it me [sic] and leave him out of it. No nasty comments to him.\"\nMinnesota Public Radio said it had reviewed \"more than 100 text and Twitter messages\" and reported that Ellison and Karen Monahan had continued texting for months after their breakup.\nThe report noted that there was \"no evidence\" of the \"alleged physical abuse\" in the material that was reviewed.\nIn a lengthy statement published late Sunday by Fox9, Karen Monahan addressed the alleged abuse, claiming that after being involved with Ellison for \"several years,\" she realized she had been suffering from \"narcissist abuse.\"\n\"Unless you have been through narcissist abuse, it is the most difficult form of abuse to articulate. It leaves survivors (if they survive) with serious health impacts, complex ptsd, depression and so many other devastating impacts. It is a slow insidious form of abuse,\" she wrote.\nIn the statement, Monahan described an incident of physical abuse right before the end of their relationship in 2017, in which she alleged that Ellison grabbed her by her feet and tried to drag her off the bed, while yelling at her and telling her to leave. She also claimed that Ellison had \"tried to intimidate and threaten me\" after she told him that she planned to write about his alleged behavior in a memoir.\n\"My kids were also impacted,\" Monahan said in the statement. \"I tried to hide it from them for several months. They knew something wasn't right with me when they came to visit but were not quite sure. I told them I was just dealing with depression, that I would be ok.\"\n\"Imagine how your own children would feel if they found out someone abused their mother,\" she wrote. \"I could barely care for myself much less deal with their pain.\"\nShe added that her kids had wanted to make the allegations public, and ultimately convinced her to break her silence.", "Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA) The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) on Tuesday introduced an EMU800 commuter train decorated with animals indigenous to the \"satoyama,\" a Japanese term that means the area between mountains and arable land, as part of a program to promote biodiversity in Taiwan.\nThe train, one of 43 commuter trains owned by the TRA, has eight carriages, each one decorated with a different species from satoyama areas of Taiwan: African grass owl, leopard cat, Chinese box turtle, Johns' frog, paradise fish, crab-eating mongoose, greater painted-snipe and pangolin.\nInside the train, there will be videos on ecology and biodiversity in Taiwan, as well as posters with information on the eight animals, the TRA said.\nThe train will start operating on the West Coast Line on Feb. 8, and will run throughout 2018, according to the TRA.\nHowever, because of the changeable schedule, the TRA is unable to offer a fixed schedule for passenger-fans.\nAt present, the train's schedule to Feb. 13 is available and anyone interested should go to: https://www.facebook.com/events/402292343545674.\nThe TRA said the project with the Forestry Bureau seeks to promote not only wildlife conservation but also areas under human influence, a key focus of the Satoyama Initiative which seeks to promote \"societies in harmony with nature.\"\nThe initiative, which was launched jointly by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan and the United Nations University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability, promotes positive human-nature relationships.\nThe initiative was introduced at the Tenth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP10) to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010.

Stautberg agreed with me that nonprofit board service is also valuable for developing governance experience. She also suggests joining committees such as finance and nominating/governance, and becoming involved in leadership succession planning, in order to build particularly relevant experience.\nIt\u2019s pretty simple, right? Boards that limit the pool of candidates from which they\u2019ll seek talent are limiting their opportunities to be the best. Boards that seek board candidates who bring the most excellent experience, expertise, and qualities to the table\u2013including women and men from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives\u2013are going to have the most effective boards.

More details after the jump.", "As badass as it sounds, the phrase feels disingenuous coming from me. I\u2019m not an aggressive person. When I say I want to be \u201caggressively androgynous,\u201d what I really mean is that I want to be confusing. I don\u2019t want to be read as male or female, at least not on first glance and at least not every day. It\u2019s a tame intention, as simple as any style choice meant to express myself, but androgyny is often read as aggression, a statement, a rebellion against gender norms.\nBut androgyny won\u2019t be a rebellion forever, and it may not be a rebellion for long. Shortly after that conversation with my coworker, I was forwarded an email that I hope signals good things to come. Stockmann, Finland\u2019s biggest department store, recently added an entire floor of gender-neutral clothing.\nUnisex clothing isn't a new concept, nor is the concept of brands and stores specifically dedicated to gender-neutral clothing options (check out The Discriminant, if you\u2019re into some queer-friendly styles). But to see such clothes adopted intentionally by a major company says a lot. A gender-neutral department won't only serve those who identify as nonbinary, genderqueer or gender-neutral (though it will increase comfort levels immensely when it comes to shopping), but it will hopefully also allow those who adhere to the gender binary to explore other options.\nHaving suffered through more than two decades of shopping strictly in women\u2019s departments, I\u2019ve gotten sick of sheer blouses that require an undershirt, or pocket-less pants that necessitate accessorizing with a kicky purse (I\u2019d shop in the men\u2019s section for the rest of my life just to have real pockets). But those who feel uncomfortable shopping in the women\u2019s section might miss out on crop tops, sequins, short shorts \u2014 some of the greatest joys of traditionally women\u2019s fashions.\n\u201cWe believe that men\u2019s and women\u2019s departments should function as guidelines to finding the clothes that best fit your shape and style rather than definite rules to follow,\" says Anna Salmi, CCO at Stockmann.\n\u201cWith One Way [the gender-neutral department] we wanted to style and curate a selection of clothes that might not be designed \u2018unisex\u2019 but that work perfectly for all people. Our aim is to inspire our customers to forget the rules and shop unbiasedly,\u201d Salmi adds.\nThe closest American department stores have gotten to this forward-thinking mindset: when Target did away with their gendered toy sections in 2015. That was a huge boon for America\u2019s children, who often grow up restricted to one section of the store (be it in toys or clothing) simply because they are told that is where they belong. This mindset often forces kids into gender roles they may not fit, and those gender roles can change the way they interact with the world. What I like about Stockmann\u2019s move is that it does for adults (most of whom having been raised in gender-restrictive environments) what Target once did for kids. Every generation could do with recognizing the middle areas of the gender spectrum a little better.\nMoreover, adding a gender-neutral department doesn\u2019t do away with gendered departments entirely, so those who are most comfortable on the binary (be they cisgender, transgender, or simply prefer to present as more masculine or more feminine) can still have easy access to clothes that work for them.\nIf this reads promotional on my end, well, you caught me. It is. Absolutely. I\u2019d love to see American companies adopt this attitude. If we all felt a little more comfortable breaking fashion rules, maybe androgyny wouldn\u2019t have to be aggressive anymore. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have to be a statement.\nBut for now, I\u2019m glad someone\u2019s making the statement. Now which American store has the guts to follow suit?", "Elon Musk offered to help the rescue in a variety of ways.\nElon Musk sent engineers to Thailand before traveling there himself and working to build a child-sized submarine to assist the rescue operation for the 12 boys and their soccer coach who were trapped in a cave.\nSome have criticized his involvement as a public-relations stunt, and many have joked about the submarine being deemed \"not practical\" by those leading the rescue mission.\nMusk on Tuesday posted what he said was a conversation with a leader of the dive team that showed the submarine was desired, and he said he was leaving it there in case it could be of use in the future.\nHe also commented on those criticizing him: \"Something's messed up if this is not a good thing.\"\nElon Musk has hit back at those who have criticized his attempts to help recuse the 13 members of a Thai soccer team who were trapped in a cave for more than two weeks.\nMusk tried to help in a variety of ways, including traveling to Thailand, sending engineers to the country, and building a child-sized submarine.\nHe said on Twitter on Wednesday that the reaction had \"shaken my opinion of many people.\"\n\"We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so,\" Musk tweeted. \"Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile.

The settlement fund is in the amount of $67,500,000. A Final Fairness Hearing will be held on December 27, 2005.\nAs summarized by the Company\u2019s FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2005, beginning in August 2004, following post-merger announcements by the Company, various shareholders of the Company commenced fourteen putative class action lawsuits against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. Plaintiff shareholders allege that certain disclosures relating to the April 2004 merger between TPC and SPC contained false or misleading statements with respect to the value of SPC\u2019s loss reserves in violation of federal securities laws. These actions have been consolidated under the caption In re St. Paul Travelers Securities Litigation I, and a lead plaintiff and lead counsel have been appointed. An additional putative class action based on the same allegations was brought in New York State Supreme Court. This action was subsequently transferred to the District of Minnesota and was consolidated with In re St. Paul Travelers Securities Litigation I. On June 24, 2005, the lead plaintiff filed an amended consolidated complaint. The amended consolidated complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. It does not specify damages. On August 23, 2005, the Company and the other defendants in In re St. Paul Travelers Securities Litigation I moved to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint.\nThe original complaint alleges that St. Paul\u2019s registration statement was materially false or misleading because it failed to disclose that (a) there were significant disparities between the accounting and actuarial methods of St. Paul and Travelers, requiring St. Paul Travelers to increase its claims reserves by $1.171 billion to conform St. Paul\u2019s less conservative accounting and actuarial methods to that of Travelers; (b) St. Paul\u2019s then existing exposure to certain adverse financial condition of a construction contractor, a reduction in reinsurance recoverables, and other similar conditions, required St. Paul Travelers to increase its claims reserves by an additional $466 million; and (c) the aggregate $1.637 billion of required increase in claims reserves due to these existing but undisclosed facts relating to St. Paul would require St. Paul Travelers to record a significant charge to its income statement, adversely impacting earnings.\nThe true facts were disclosed to the market on July 23, 2004, when St. Paul Travelers revealed that certain conditions relating to St. Paul required the Company to increase its claims reserves by $1.6 billion. On August 5, 2004, St. Paul Travelers further announced that the required $1.6 billion increase in claims reserves would result in an operating loss of $310 million or $0.47 per basic and diluted share for the quarter.\nThe per share closing price of St. Paul common stock was $40.77 on April 1, 2004, the date on which each share of Travelers\u2019 Class A and Class B common stock was exchanged for 0.4334 share of St. Paul common stock pursuant to the materially false or misleading registration statement. By the time the true extent of required reserve increase and its adverse impacts against St. Paul Travelers were fully disclosed to the market on August 5, 2004, the per share price of St. Paul common stock had declined by $6.02 or 14.77% to close at $34.75 on August 5, 2004 \u2013 causing massive losses to former Travelers shareholders.\nKarl A. Kleinschrod, et al. v. The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc., et al.", "Are wedding photos posted to social networks unoriginal and lame? That\u2019s the provocative argument from Michael MacDonald, a postmedia editor and blogger, who got plenty of reaction when he complained about repetitive, emotionally suffocating wedding photos he sees too often on Facebook.\nMacDonald\u2019s age might have something to do with his frequent encounters with the wedding photo genre. The average Canadian bride is about 31.5 years old, while grooms are about 34. Judging from his photo, I would guess that MacDonald falls quite squarely into this happy demographic. So would lots of his Facebook friends.\nBut MacDonald has a point. Wedding photos are often repetitive and contrived. And yet we proudly share them on the Web, hang them on our walls and carry them around in wallets. Is there something wrong with this picture?\nThe field of wedding photography has come a long, long way from its stodgy beginnings. The British website, The Wedding Photo Secret, shows how the first wedding photos were severely constrained by limited technology of the day. By today\u2019s standards the shots could hardly be considered more dull. And they looked very similar to each other.\nThis collection of old wedding photos on The Wedding Secret websites illustrates one of the truisms of the early form: no formal wedding dresses. Note that in each photo, the woman literally stands behind her man, usually with her hand resting on his shoulder.\nThe inventions of flashbulbs, film technology, and lighter equipment gave photographers greater mobility and flexibility. Wedding photography took hold as a cultural product and staple of marriage ceremonies. Searching \u201cwedding photography\u201d in the Calgary Yellow Pages, I found about 47 companies providing the service today.\nYet, the sameness in wedding photography persists, reflecting the ceremonies themselves.\nWedding photography relies on certain pre-established conventions associated with the genre, such as the shot of the wedding ceremony, tossing the bouquet, or cutting the cake. A genre implies a reliable set of characteristics for consumers, along with a convenient way of focusing and organizing materials for the professional photographer.\nIn photography, as in movies, genres help guide the user experience. Wikipedia describes two long-established and two emerging approaches to wedding photography. In the traditionalapproach, the photographer controls the scene and takes classic genre shots. The photojournalisticapproach, my personal favourite, emphasizes candid shots over posed ones. The fashionapproach combines the first two, but also includes photography inspired by famous fashion magazines, along with value-adding treatments to the images themselves. A fourth style is wedding studio photography, which combines glamour photography, a studio, and frequent changes in outfits, makeup, hairdo and backdrop.\nThe Wedding Photojournalist Association is at the forefront of the push for professional excellence. The slideshows of the group\u2019s recent photography contest offer spectacular examples of leading work. You can see each photographer\u2019s vision come to life in genre categories such as Getting Ready; Ceremony; Reception; Shoe Details; Silhouettes, Shadows, and Good Light; Toasting/Speeches; and Portrait of Bridal Party. Below is a shot by Marianne Earthy of London.\nHigh-end photographers don\u2019t have the market cornered on noteworthy wedding shots. By accident or by design, point-and-shoot amateurs like you and me sometimes capture a truly memorable moment \u2013 not technically outstanding, perhaps, but valuable all the same. Reassuringly, the cultural scholar Raymond Williams, in his 1961 book, The Long Revolution, says art need not always be cutting-edge to successfully communicate meaning. Williams writes: \u201cIn many societies it has been the function of art to embody what we can call the common meanings of the society. The artist is not describing new experiences, but embodying known experiences.\nSo we proudly share our technically average wedding photos on social networks. The world of word-of-mouth is where we get most of our information about each other. Another scholar who explores the value of everyday, as opposed to professional, forms of communication is sociologist Herbert J. Gans. He believes most people usually spend more time with the \u201cnews\u201d they get from informal networks \u2013 over the picket fence, around the water cooler, in instant messages, or via video sites \u2013 than they do from professional sources.\nSo if you\u2019re seeing a stream of artistically average wedding photos in your social network, the grapevine is alive and well. You\u2019re probably more interested in the experience represented by the images, anyway, rather than the photographer\u2019s ability to make a personal artistic statement. If you\u2019re looking for originality in wedding photography, social networks may not be the best source.", "THE AUSTRALIAN colonies began very unpromisingly as a convict society built on Aboriginal dispossession. Nevertheless, robust elected institutions soon developed. There was responsible government by the 1850s, full white male suffrage by the 1860s, the secret ballot (a local invention) and payment of members.\nFederation was achieved in 1901, without violence, after a referendum endorsed a constitution, and votes for women by 1902 (before Canada, Britain or the US, although later than New Zealand). Political changes occurred rapidly and peacefully, although colonial parliaments adopted a brutality in debate that became a fixture in our political tradition.\nThis enormous achievement has been poorly understood and its leading figures largely forgotten. There is much in John Howard's assertion that most Australian citizens have a shaky grasp of, or even interest in, our constitutional history. Some of his ministers demonstrated this when journalists put them to the test. So did some state premiers.\nPeter Cochrane, a graduate of La Trobe and Adelaide, is a prolific writer whose works include companion volumes to the ABC television series Australians at War and Simpson and the Donkey. He argues that recent historians put too much emphasis on analysis, not enough on narrative, and his landscape is peopled by flawed heroes.\nColonial Ambition is a dramatic, and largely successful, attempt to tell the story of how democracy developed in NSW, and introduce us to the major players involved - John Dunmore Lang, Charles Cowper, Robert Lowe, Henry Parkes as the proponents, William Charles Wentworth on the other side, and colonial governors George Gipps, Charles Fitzroy and William Denison stuck in the middle. Publication was supported by the Sesquicentenary of Responsible Government in New South Wales Committee. The other colonies receive sparse cover.\nThe publisher's note on the back cover reads: \"Written with great brio and verve, Colonial Ambition reads like a fast-paced novel. Cochrane has brought to life the various players in a way that is rare in the writing of Australian history.\" This may be an understatement.\nCochrane has a strong cast to play with.\nWilliam Charles Wentworth (1790-1872), a native son, is the dominant figure in his narrative, from first to last, even though his commitment to independent institutions was far from a democratic model, which he despised. He was in and out of the NSW Legislative Council between 1843 and 1862. He had more intellectual power and drive than any of the other great squatters, and they could not do without him, much as some disliked him.\nJohn Dunmore Lang (1799-1878), Presbyterian cleric, born in Glasgow, was a great orator and the most radical thinker in public life, a republican, leader of the anti-transportation movement and an advocate of Irish home rule.\nRobert Lowe (1811-1892), albino and invalid, came to Sydney for his health, achieved a dominant intellectual position, made enemies freely, campaigning against the squatters, against transportation, against extending the franchise, and for non-denominational schools, before he returned to England, wrote leaders for The Times and served as Gladstone's chancellor of the exchequer.\nCharles Cowper (1807-1875), originally a High Church Anglican conservative pastoralist, became a leader of the anti-transportation movement and a political moderate, five times premier and a consummate \"fixer\".\nHenry Parkes (1815-1896), or Henry Watson Parkes as Cochrane wrongly calls him, was an ex-Chartist, a bone and ivory turner who migrated to Sydney in 1839, became a journalist and poet, ran a string of toy shops (including one in Geelong) and became the prime organiser of the progressives in Sydney. Five times premier, he proclaimed himself as \"Father of Federation\".\nCochrane's central theme is the conflict between three forces - the squatters, an oligarchy that defined itself as \"landed gentry\", led by Wentworth for years, supported by the Macarthur dynasty; their political enemies, artisans, shopkeepers, merchants and renegade gentry, strong in Sydney, weaker in the bush, led by Lang, Cowper and Parkes; and successive governors, directed by the Colonial Office, fearful of democracy and yet repelled by squatter rapacity and with some vague moral concerns about Aboriginal welfare.\nThree great issues arose - the land, the franchise and labour. The squatters wanted secure title for their pre-emptive seizures, capacity to dominate representative institutions and use of convict or \"coolie\" labour.\nTheir Sydney-based opponents - we can hardly call them democrats, a word they avoided - wanted free markets for land, direct elections and wage security for workers. Governors tried to balance the squatters and their opponents, keeping control of unallocated or \"waste\" lands in their own hands, and maintaining the right to nominate members to the Legislative Council.\nColonial Ambition ends, ironically, with the passage of the 1861 act that entrenched lifetime appointments to the NSW Legislative Council, a system that remained until 1934, a system not far removed from Wentworth's proposal for a nominated chamber that was mocked as a \"bunyip aristocracy\".\nThe book is hugely enjoyable, with excellent illustrations, impressive documentation and a near perfect index.\nBarry Jones' A Thinking Reed is published by Allen & Unwin at $55.", "Actress Mary Steenburgen opens up about her strong marriage with Ted Danson after 23 years.\nAt age 71, Ted Danson is still head over heels in love with his wife of nearly 25 years, Mary Steenburgen.\nDanson credited his upbringing for inspiring him to have such a blissful union with the 66-year-old actress.\n\u201cI consider myself a family man, partially because my parents did it so damn well,\u201d said Danson to Closer Weekly about his parents\u2019 nearly 40-year marriage.\nDuring his early acting days, Danson was previously married to college sweetheart Randall Gosch from 1970 until 1975. According to the magazine, it\u2019s a relationship he still declines to discuss all these years later. In 1977 he married a second time to Casey Coates.\n\u201cIt was love at first sight,\u201d the star said of his second wife.\nThe pair endured a terrifying time when Coates nearly died from a stroke while giving birth to their daughter Kate Danson in 1979. Danson, who is also a father to daughter Alexis Danson with Coates, put his acting career on hold to care for his wife.\nHis career took off in the early \u201880s when he starred as bartender Sam Malone on \u201cCheers.\u201d The show aired from 1982 until 1993.\n\u201cI\u2019m forever grateful \u2014 it was an amazing 11 years of my life,\u201d said Danson about appearing in the sitcom alongside Woody Harrelson, Kirstie Alley and Kelsey Grammer, among others.\n\u201cI walk around and people smile at me because they\u2019re remembering something funny that I was a part of on \u2018Cheers,\u2019\u201d he added.\nBut things would quickly take a nosedive for Danson. According to Closer Weekly, Danson\u2019s marriage to Coates \u201ccrumbled\u201d after his affair with \u201cMade in America\u201d co-star Whoopi Goldberg went public. The scandal reportedly led to Coates and Danson\u2019s $30 million divorce in 1993 \u2014 one of the most expensive in Hollywood history.\nOnce the dust settled, Danson had no interest in remarrying again \u2014 until he met Steenburgen in the mid-\u201890s.\nThings have never been the same for Danson. The couple tied the knot in 1995.\nDanson also insisted their children and grandchildren give the couple great joy. Steenburgen shares a son and daughter with actor Malcolm McDowell, to whom she was married from 1980 until 1990.\nDanson has kept busy pursuing acting \u2014 but for him, his family will always come first.\nBack in 2017, Steenburgen told Closer Weekly she credited Danson for helping her overcome a dark past.\nShe added that during tough times, she watched her future second husband on TV.\nSteenburgen insisted she\u2019s happier than ever with the \u201cridiculously talented\u201d star.\nThe latest issue of Closer Weekly is currently on newsstands.", "When I was in college, I studied film and took a few classes in film theory and criticism. It never stuck and so I went more into the production side of film. One of the subjects that put me off was semiotics \u2014 the study of signs and symbols along with the study of the interpretation of signs and symbols. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I liked good lighting, composition, juxtaposition, and editing with many of my film majors. But looking for the meaning of a frame\u2019s shadow in the shape of a cross from the mullions in the nearby window behind the heroine of a film is not as interesting as dialogue, characters, and plot devices. Not to mention a pretty face. Plus, the more I think about it and the more I understand about movie production \u2014 the kind of films that become available through mass distribution \u2014 the idea that any director or writer can control the potential signs and symbols of any movie is beyond belief.\nthe sign of ashes is quite challenging if understand what it really means. We are saying some pretty powerful stuff and making some extensive promises of a sort.\nMany female congressional Democrats dressed in white for President Trump\u2019s state of the union address. The white supposedly symbolized female suffrage, or something. It looked like a form of protest.\nIn New Hampshire, a few male Republican state legislators who oppose gun control legislation wore pearls to a session of the House of Representatives in which citizens testified about their experiences with gun violence. Apparently, the pearls were meant to convey that gun-control activists are \u201cclutching their pearls.\u201d (A pro-gun group claimed that the pearls merely symbolized opposition to gun control legislation and support for the Second Amendment, but it\u2019s not clear why pearls symbolize these things, other than as a way of mocking gun-control supporters.\nThe Legislative Director of the Women\u2019s Defense League of New Hampshire has informed me that the pearls worn by the legislators are the longstanding trademark of that organization, which is a volunteer group dedicated to firearms education and training for women, and Second Amendment advocacy before the New Hampshire legislature. Its legislative team wears a string of pearls and has handed out costume jewelry pearls at anti-gun bill hearings.\nThe claim that the pearls mocked anti-gun activists \u2014 as in \u201cclutching their pearls\u201d \u2014 appears to have been concocted by these activists as a way of making the pro-Second Amendment legislators look bad. It is basically a slander.\nThe lesson we all should be learning is that symbols and signs are not nearly as straightforward in communication as words.\nThe fact that Sandmann and many of his fellow demonstrators were wearing that hat elevated the stakes of the situation from a reflection of the character of one school to a testament to the (im)morality of an entire political movement and cultural class. I saw a number of liberals compare the teen to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another alum of a wealthy, all-boys Catholic school. Sandmann was described as a young Kavanaugh, both reflecting the power structures that (in the view of the people on the left) define and corrode modern American life.\n. . . But on the whole, the core commentary that you heard from left-liberal social media was ideological rather than personal. The incident served as a kind of perfect morality play for people on the left: MAGA hat-wearing wealthy young kids versus dignified Native elder.\nThe hats extinguished pretty much any benefit of the doubt a liberal observer might have given these kids. Without them, it\u2019s possible many would have dismissed the incident as one of many examples of privileged boys behaving badly. But wearing them, Sandmann and his classmates become a personification of All That Is Wrong With America, proof positive that Trump has ushered in a new dark age in the country. For that reason, the clip was destined to go viral on the left, with Sandmann personally becoming the villain of the hour.\nWhat this incident indicates is that the certainty of a sign\u2019s interpretation correlates to the depth of the semiotician\u2019s ideology. Those with a definite political perspective have great confidence about a sign\u2019s meaning. Others with less ideological baggage find signs to be capable of multiple interpretations.\nThe Protestant point behind all this is again the logocentric one. As hard as words \u2014 especially God\u2019s word \u2014 can be to interpret, they are far easier to weigh and assess than objects or markings. What the times need may be more grammatico-historical exegesis and less semiotics.", "Police: Statues Vandalized Outside Of New Jersey ChurchInvestigators say three statues were vandalized at Our Lady of the Lake Church in Verona.\nAt Least One Person Pulled From Verona, NJ Building Struck By CarEmergency responders pulled at least one person from a building in Verona, New Jersey Friday afternoon, after a car smashed into the structure.\nTown Icon Killed In Hit-And-Run Leaving Verona Calligraphy ShopPolice are looking for witnesses of a hit-and-run that killed a beloved town icon in Verona, New Jersey.\nFriend Able to Help Save Suicidal Woman Despite Reaching Out To Wrong Police Department In Different CountryAn email from a concerned friend of a suicidal student in Verona, Italy, mistakenly went to a police department of the same name in New Jersey, but authorities said it helped save a life.\nNJ Assembly Votes To Halt Use Of Standardized TestsThe New Jersey State Assembly voted Monday to curtail the use of a controversial standardized test in the state\u2019s schools, following a litany of concerns from parents.\nYoung Cancer Patients Express Gratitude Towards Valerie FundWCBS 880 has partnered with the Valerie Fund to support this Saturday's Valerie Fund Walk and JAG Physical Therapy Run, which will be held in Verona Park in Verona, New Jersey.\nValerie Fund Holds Camp Happy Times For Young Cancer PatientsAmong the Valerie Fund's programs is Camp Happy Times, a summer camp for current and former patients to get away and spend time with other survivors. 23-year-old cancer survivor Lashikeerah Walker spoke with Metaxas about the camp.\nParents Of Young Cancer Patients Find Patience At The Valerie FundThere are no age limits on the children the Valerie Fund will treat.

A number of writers are present, such as Barney Hoskyns, Robert Christgau, and the unbelievably annoying historian Alan Clayson. Mick Taylor\u2019s former boss John Mayall contributes, as do various former Stones sidemen. The most unlikely comments come from Taylor himself, who still seems to be in something like denial about the whole experience .\nThe DVD begins in the wake of Their Satanic Majesties Request album, which was pretty much a disaster. With Beggars Banquet, Keith Richards and Mick Jagger took over the band from the increasingly addled Brian Jones. During the sessions for the follow-up \u2014 titled Let It Bleed, Jones was replaced by Mick Taylor.\nJones died just two days before what was to be Mick Taylor\u2019s public introduction as a Rolling Stone, at a huge concert in London\u2019s Hyde Park. Talk about a pressure situation. The concert became a memorial for Brian Jones, and a bit of a trial by fire for the new guitarist. Mick Taylor had just turned 20. The group then toured the States, winding it up in December with a free show at a speedway in California called Altamont. The live footage accompanying this period is not particularly rare, but it is nice to see how easily Taylor had already slotted into the band.\nTwo undisputed classic Stones records followed, Sticky Fingers and Exile On Main Street. Both are discussed in depth. From there, the inevitable decline sets in, due primarily to the lifestyle of the various members.\nGoats Head Soup and Its Only Rock And Roll were the final two albums that Mick Taylor recorded as a Rolling Stone, and they were hardly fitting epitaphs. Still, his playing on Rock And Roll\u2019s \u201cTime Waits For No One\u201d is absolutely brilliant.\nAt this point in the DVD, Mick Taylor gives his reasons for leaving the band, which are vague at best. It is up to the talking heads to illuminate us on what was really going on, and their explanations make a lot of sense. First was the fact that the young guitarist was dealing with his own drug problems. Maybe more significantly was his anger at not receiving songwriting credit for his contributions. Even a cursory listen to the music the band recorded after his departure makes it clear that he had a major role in shaping the music.\nThe only extra on the DVD is a six-minute segment titled \u201cMeeting Mick Taylor\u201d in which John Mayall talks about how he met his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nThe Mick Taylor Years is a pretty good documentary about the time he spent as a Rolling Stone, but it is a little light on rare footage. Still, for those of us who think his time with the band is grossly underrated, it is worth seeing.", "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - \u201cJeopardy!\u201d host Alex Trebek, one of the most recognizable faces in U.S. television, has been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, he said in a video message on Wednesday. He vowed to beat the disease despite its low survival rate.\nSince 1984, the Canadian-born Trebek has hosted the syndicated game show, in which contestants must display their knowledge of a broad array of trivia topics by stating their answers in the form of a question.\nTrebek, 78, said in a video message posted to YouTube that he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer earlier this week.\n\u201cNow normally, the prognosis for this is not very encouraging, but I\u2019m going to fight this, and I\u2019m going to keep working,\u201d Trebek said.\nStage 4 typically means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, and the five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer that advanced is 3 percent, according to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.\nThe low survival rate is attributed to the fact fewer than 20 percent of pancreatic tumours are confined to the pancreas at the time of diagnosis.\nTrebek, who is known for his straight-faced but witty banter with contestants, made a joke about his vow to survive the disease.\n\u201cJeopardy!\u201d is watched by 23 million viewers a week in the U.S. and Canada, making it the most watched quiz show in that television market. Trebek has hosted more than 7,000 episodes.\nHe also has won five Daytime Emmy awards for outstanding game show host and in 2011 received a lifetime achievement Emmy.\nAfter he was injured in a fall in 2017, Trebek had surgery to remove blood clots on the brain and took a break from taping episodes.\nHe returned to the show in January 2018.\nTrebek, who is from a nickel-mining town in Ontario, suffered a heart attack in 2012 and was hospitalized for another in 2007.\n\u201cJeopardy!\u201d is produced by Sony Pictures Television, a division of Sony Corp, and distributed by a division of CBS Corp.", "A young mum has thanked a Special sergeant whose actions may have saved the lives of her twin baby girls.\nNicola Smith, 26, and her family were travelling through Cambridgeshire along the A14 near Spittals when their car broke down, with smoke coming from under the bonnet.\nFearing the car was about to burst into flames, Nicola, her fianc\u00e9, and her seven-year-old son Matthew all got out the car with six-month-old twins Emily and Olivia.\nHowever, Nicola was terrified that the twins, who were born seven-weeks premature, would not be able to cope with the cold.\nBy luck, Special Sergeant Paul Jenkins was driving by on the other side of the carriageway, sensed something was wrong and went back to find out.\nHe took the distressed mum and her children to the safety and warmth of Cambridge services while Nicola\u2019s fianc\u00e9 waited with the car for breakdown services to arrive.\nNicola said: \u201cWhen we broke down I felt sick. I thought we can either stay in the car and risk it blowing up or get out and huddle in the freezing cold by the emergency lay-by phone.\n\u201cWhile my fianc\u00e9 called breakdown I looked after the children as best I could but my twins have immature lungs and serious breathing difficulties, so being in the cold by the side of the A14 was just terrible.\n\u201cPaul had seen us struggling to keep our children safe by the side of the hugely busy road and went out of his way to turn around and come to our rescue.

Rainer Wieland, a German MEP working on the review, says such questions could be postponed to a later date.\nWith the European Commission and Parliament leading a joint committee to scrutinise the EU\u2019s lobbyist transparency register, NGOs are keeping a close eye on the developments. The Parliament's credibility is at risk if the register is not made mandatory, argues Paul de Clerck.\nThe European Transparency Register, the EU's database for lobbyists, is currently under scrutiny as it set to be reformed by the end of 2013.

We live our life on television and, Lord willing, everybody will be able to see Christian values that we hope will point other people to God.

Keep clicking, this is by far not the most controversial thing Jessa will be involved in before the year is out!\nIn June 2014, Jill Duggar became Jill Dillard as she said \"I do\" to her love Derick Dillard. They shared their first kiss at the alter in front of about 1,000 wedding guests. No pressure!\nBaby Dilly Is on the Way!\nLess than two months after tying the knot, Derick and Jill Dillard announced they were expecting their first little one together. As for why they decided to announce it so soon, Jill said she was just so gosh darn excited to be pregnant, plus she wants every life to be celebrated, no matter how small.\nOn the heels of her next oldest sister getting married, Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald announced they'd be tying the knot before the end of the year as well.\nAt 24, Jana Duggar is hardly an old maid.

By the third quarter of last year, daily shipments of crude oil were exceeding 500,000 barrels per day, roughly equivalent to the output of OPEC\u2019s smallest member, Ecuador.\nIf growth patterns hold, crude by rail could \u201ceasily\u201d blow past 600,000 barrels per day by early 2013, AAR said.\nDismissed by some observers as a transient phenomenon when rail movements of crude oil first emerged as a significant development in North American oil markets a few years ago, recent market activity suggests big players are betting the phenomenon will continue.\nOil marketer and shipper Plains All-American Pipeline LP paid $500 million last month to buy four operating rail terminals for crude oil shipment.\nGrowing rail shipments of oil have also eased some of the pain for railroads from rising U.S. natural gas output, another facet of the shale revolution, which is cutting into electric utilities\u2019 demand for coal.\nCoal shipments on major U.S. railroads fell nearly 11 percent in 2012 to 6.03 million carloads.\nHydraulic fracturing techniques also require large amounts of sand and other material that is being moved by trains, which further offsets some of the losses in the coal cater gory.\nBNSF Railway, owned by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway , is the biggest mover of crude by rail, largely thanks to its foothold in the Bakken shale oil play in North Dakota and Montana.\nJohn Miller, BNSF\u2019s vice president of sales for industrial products, told Reuters in an interview that the company has gone from moving about 5 percent of Bakken output two years ago to nearly half today.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible growth, and that\u2019s spurred strengthening of the infrastructure we have,\u201d Miller said.\nBy the end of the third quarter last year, about 430,000 barrels per day of crude moved out of North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale play by rail, up from nearly nothing in mid-2010, according to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority.\nMiller said BNSF touches all the shale plays across the western United States, but rail in the Bakken play is much further along than others in development rail efficiencies.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see development in the other shales as well, but they don\u2019t seem to have the speed or the depth that the Bakken does - at least not yet,\u201d he said.\nRail shipments to the Gulf Coast may shrink once pipelines move more crude into the region from the glutted U.S. crude futures hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, or the booming Eagle Ford shale and Permian Basin in Texas.\nEnterprise Products partners LP and Enbridge Inc\u2019s jointly owned Seaway pipeline is slated to start moving 400,000 bpd of crude from Cushing to the U.S. Gulf Coast next week, unveiling the first of two expansions on the line that was reversed last year.\nThe second expansion involves building a new parallel pipeline that will up shipments to 850,000 bpd by early 2014.\nHowever, these developments are unlikely to spell the end of rail movements.\n\u201cA pipe goes from A to B. Rail is more flexible. If prices are higher somewhere else, send the train there,\u201d said Rusty Braziel, president of consultancy RBN Energy LLC in Houston.\nRefiners on the East and West coasts increasingly are tapping rail because inland crude\u2019s discount to other global crudes makes crude-by-rail profitable despite transportation costs that can reach the mid-teens.\nLast September Tesoro Corp began moving up to 40,000 bpd to a new offloading facility at its 120,000 bpd refinery in Anacortes, Washington.\nTesoro is also processing up to 5,000 bpd of Bakken crude at its 166,000 bpd refinery in Martinez, California.\nRival Phillips 66 is buying 2,000 railcars, with deliveries starting early this year, to increase shipments to its coastal refineries in New Jersey and Washington.\nBP Plc is also seeking permits to build an offloading facility by spring of 2014 to bring up to 60,000 bpd of oil to its 225,000 bpd Cherry Point refinery in Blaine, Washington.\nAnd PBF Energy aims to lease thousands of railcars to move cheaper inland U.S. and Canadian crude to its Delaware and New Jersey refineries.", "We should understand that either religion or spirituality and politics affects humans. A politics lacking spirituality is grossly polluted with corruption, cronyism and sycophancy. It produces and creates an unethical atmosphere of schemed situations of circumstances against the people. All these are due to if one does not recognize the individual or universal spirit, there is no reason for a person to be ethical.\nPolitics without ethics and human values would result in untrustworthiness, crime and corruption.\nThe goal of politics is to bring good governance and increase material, emotional and physical well-being and comfort of people. At the same time, the purpose of spirituality is to raise and encourage morality and human values. Politics and spirituality are inseparable bed-fellows and they need to go hand in hand.\nFor good governance to produce the desired results, spirituality is necessary and essential. Only spirituality can provide, bring about the desire commitment, care and confidence required for good governance. People with Spiritual values live such manifestations, as these qualities are required absolutely and very essential for those in governance.\nA leader has to be a someone who sees everyone as being equal; someone, who transports, transmits and go along with the Truth; someone, who is transparent in all his actions and deeds; someone who is broad-minded and a visionary; and above all an embodiment of love and compassion. Also should be a person who abounds with empathy.\nIt is a common knowledge that, religion has been the source and cause of many wars on this planet. However, religion and spirituality on the other hand have survived, only, for the reason of its patronage of and by the state.\nWhenever a society is seen as chaotic and lacks spiritual values it becomes apparently difficult to govern. Similarly it is also difficult for spirituality to survive if there is no official patronage.\nPeople who possess a degree Spirituality are honest and committed, as it is a necessary tool to create a crime-free society. State patronage makes spirituality spread quicker to all sections of society.\nWhile many wars are fought or had been fought in the name of religion, spirituality has given courage, confidence and commitment to people even in the toughest of times.\nMany saints, prophets, and others have been victimized due to lack of political patronage. For example, many believers of varied religious beliefs were persecuted by the state. This affected the morale of society and resulted in bad governance.\nIt can be argued that 'Religion' has created conflict, but irreligious societies have created worse chaos and corruption in human history. Did not millions suffer in Russia, China and Cambodia in the name of freeing society of religious beliefs?\nToday, both religion and politics need reform.\nReligion has to become more spiritual to allow freedom of worship and broader to encompass all the wisdom in the world and also politicians have to become more righteous and spiritual to have greater discernment.\nWhen spirituality and politics fails to coexist, then you have corrupt politicians and pseudo-religious leaders.\nSpirituality is deeply ingrained in Ghana's political settings; the present day religious kingpins are more of 'mafia' types. For most, are clothed in turpitude to associate with religion and more so being spiritual. In the times gone by, religion have guided and counseled rulers and in turn rulers have supported religious and spiritual leaders.\nThese present day religious leaders do not appealed to people across the board because of their spiritual approach depravity. Spirituality brought freedom to the State Ghana in the past. The advent of both Christianity and Islam did bring about spirituality and gave a secular ethos to our world of politics and spirituality.\nNow as we progress as people, the need of the hour should be our ability to provide a prejudice-free political system. And also in a situation where vilification and demonization of people is relegated!

The heavy-duty parkas are a status symbol in certain circles; the brand\u2019s circular red-and-white logo usually stamped on the sleeve. A quick look at the Canada Goose website shows that vests can cost more $400, parkas $900-$1200, and a simple beanie $175. Needless to say, high schoolers do not need a jump-start on needlessly forking over hundreds of dollars to fashion companies, as life is long and capitalism comes for us all and there will be ample opportunity for that in adulthood.\nThe pressure to show up to school decked out in Canada Goose is unrealistic for some low-income students; the Woodchurch High School in England sent a letter to parents announcing the ban this week, according to the Washington Post (Moncler and Pyrenex are also banned). The move was decided after consulting with a group of students, according to the school\u2019s head teacher Rebekah Phillips.\nShe told the BBC: \u201cWe are very concerned as a school about poverty-proofing our school environment and, as such, we met with groups of pupils and made the decision in consultation with them.\u201d Poverty-proofing aims \u201cto reduce stigma and remove barriers\u201d to education, according to the UK-based project\u2019s website.\nNot everyone is happy with the ban, but I suppose they will just have to wear their Canada Goose on the weekends or wait until next year to see if the school decides to change its mind. In a few months, anyway, it won\u2019t matter, because it\u2019ll be spring.", "How can refugees be distributed fairly among EU member states?\nBy Solon Ardittis | Eurasylum Ltd.\nSolon Ardittis asks where the proposed migrant relocation quotas come from, on what basis they are calculated, and why so many member states are reluctant to accept them.\nSolon Ardittis is Managing Director of Eurasylum Ltd, a European research and consulting firm specialising solely in issues of immigration and asylum policy on behalf of public authorities and EU institutions. He is also joint managing editor of Migration Policy Practice, a bi-monthly journal directed at senior policy makers worldwide.\nIntra-EU relocation quotas have been under discussion for a number of years now. But until the so-called \u2018migrant crisis\u2019 started to hit the news earlier this year, the debate around relocation only referred to beneficiaries of international protection, and therefore to third-country nationals already enjoying a legal status in one of the member states. Consensus within the EU at the time was already limited. It is therefore of little surprise that it is even more limited now that the debate around relocation is set to include asylum seekers whose protection claims have not even been examined yet.\nSo, how should the concept of relocation be approached?\nThere are probably two main options. The first would be to take the view that relocation quotas should follow a bottom-up approach and therefore result strictly from a specific request from each member state indicating the number of asylum seekers it is willing to accept. Some member states would be likely not to issue any requests, others would submit a request for a very limited number of asylum seekers and others, like Germany, would offer to welcome 800,000+ asylum seekers. Member states would calculate their national requests on the basis not only of the political will and capacity at central government level but, also, just as importantly, on the basis of expressions of interest received from local and regional authorities. While national public opinions would also of course merit inclusion in the list of variables affecting the national requests, they would probably be too difficult to measure in any systematic way, not least in view of their highly fluctuating nature since the beginning of the migrant crisis.\nUnder this approach, the total figure at EU level would then be calculated on the basis of the national requests and the figure\u2019s appropriateness would be assessed accordingly. In view of the current resonance of the migrant crisis, and the increasing interest expressed by many cities and towns across Europe in accepting asylum seekers, it is likely that the total EU figure would exceed the 160,000 asylum seekers which the European Commission recently proposed, following a logic that to this day remains unclear. One caveat to this approach would be that, to the extent possible, asylum seekers would also have a say on the member states where they would be relocated, based on family ties, language skills etc.\nThe second model would consist of taking a more \u2018scientific\u2019 approach to the quota distribution criteria. This would entail basing the criteria on relevant and verifiable variables such as the GDP, geographic size and population density of each member state. In a report for the European Commission prepared by Eurasylum and Ramboll in 2010, a simulation exercise had been conducted to determine the number of beneficiaries of international protection that should be relocated to each member state, compared with the current numbers of beneficiaries accepted by each member state. The results of this exercise were worthy of notice, to say the least.\nThey showed, for example, that member states such as Austria and the United Kingdom should receive around 70% fewer beneficiaries of international protection than they currently do. In Belgium, France and Germany it should be 60% less, and in Italy 55% less. On the other hand, a number of member states should receive substantially more beneficiaries of international protection than they currently do. For example, based on the above criteria, it should be + 700% in Hungary, + 750% in the Czech Republic, and + 3,000% in Luxembourg.\nEither of the above models would have the merit of being fair, transparent and comprehensible, unlike the current EU approach of imposing mandatory quotas on all member states indiscriminately, and possibly also imposing sanctions on unwilling member states. The current EU approach is unlikely to generate consensus in any foreseeable future and has the potential to damage the EU\u2019s existing asylum and immigration system, with a growing number of member states deciding to suspend the implementation of the Dublin and Schengen rules.\nAny policy that forces Nation States and their people to accept migrants is undemocratic and totalitarian.\nThe EU fanatics may not like the fact but people decide who and how many they will accommodate, not the empire builders in Brussels.\nFirst of all there has to be a separation between refugees and immigrants, illegal immigrants should be deported, there is no other way. Second, the only way to distribute refugees is only by accepting them to the country they finally want to go! In addition the EU should assist by all means the border countries of the EU in order to register the people entering European borders and then provide the transportation to the country they wish to go in order to fight the trafficking networks! It is also necessary to pressure Turkey and Algeria so to control their borders and provide them with technical assistance in order to tackle trafficking. There also should be places in Turkey in which asylum seekers will be able to ask asylum in Turkey, because i guess it is very difficult for something like that to happen in Syria! But for all those to happen EU has to be draconian against illegal immigration!\nHow much do you figure it will cost to house, feed, provide medical care, to hold all these people until you are ready to transport them? Has anyone consider these people may not be vaccinated against diseases and how many might be carrying some kind of contagious infection to share with you. Poor planning may well be the death of you.\nThe best way to distribute refugees is to send them back to whence they came and soon word will spread and they will stop coming. Otherwise you should start planning for the Yemeni hoard that is beginning to quay up as I type.", "TUSCALOOSA | Two years ago, Markus McKinney had to worry only about catching bounce passes, chest passes and alley-oops.

But some issues are unique to developers. Here are the top 10 things that tick off software developers.\nHave you noticed that your software developers seem a bit cranky lately? If you're a project manager, their boss, a recruiter or a QA professional, you might be the reason. That's according to new data from devRant, an online community built to encourage bonding, knowledge-sharing, networking and, yes, ranting, between software developers.\nCo-founders David Fox and Tim Rogus, both software developers themselves, founded the devRant community in March 2016, and since then have had approximately 15,000 software developers post more than 25,000 \"rants.\"\nTo better understand the issues and challenges their profession faces, Fox and Rogus searched the community for common keywords, and then factored in the occurrence of \"heated\" language and swear words to determine which issues really set developers off.\n\"Admittedly, our methods weren't incredibly scientific, but overall we feel we have a solid sense of the most common annoyances developers face, especially since the same things kept coming up over and over again. What companies should take away from this -- besides a few chuckles -- is that it's important to listen to what your developers say, to make them feel heard and understood and do what you can to address those issues,\" says co-founder David Fox.\nHere, based on the number of rants on the topic that included \"heated\" language and swear words, are the top 10 issues that are ticking off your software developer teams.\n*Slide statistics are rounded up.\nDevelopers as a general rule don't like being told how to do their job, and since product/project managers often oversee developer teams, they often have to do just that, says Fox. That can create friction.\n\"What I think it really comes down to is product/project managers are, in a lot of ways, the owner of these projects and processes without understanding the obstacles and challenges developers face on a daily basis,\" Fox says.\nJust like product/project managers, development managers or engineering managers have to direct the activities of developers to make sure projects are completed on time and under budget.\n\"In some companies you can also run into situations where a developer's boss is a contributing member of the team, or have been promoted from a developer role, and that introduces extra conflict,\" Fox says.\nDevelopers don't have to be actively looking for a job to be bothered by recruiters; in such a tight talent market, it'd be tough to find a software developer or engineer who hasn't been approached by a recruiter looking to poach them, Fox says.\n\"The persistence of recruiters is a big problem. They call, they email, they just won't leave you alone, even if you're not looking for a job. This gets really annoying. If you are looking for a job, the most annoying things about recruiters tend to be sending developers completely irrelevant job openings, or positions that don't fit your requirements -- like a job that's completely across the country when you don't want to relocate,\" Fox says.\nDevelopers complain when there's no documentation; they complain when there's too much documentation; they complain when they have to write documentation; they complain about how others have written documentation -- there's no getting around this one, Fox says.\n\"Documentation's one of those issues that all developers can agree on: They want well-written, accurate, concise documentation, but they don't want to write it,\" he says.\nThis is a problem for everyone, not just developers. Unnecessary, tedious, lengthy meetings aren't anyone's idea of a good time, Fox says. \"There are even mugs and ribbons available that say, 'I survived another meeting that should have been an email,'\" Fox says.\nWith the advent of the agile methodology, \"flat\" organizations and the emphasis on collaboration and teamwork, open office plans are the norm nowadays, especially for software development teams. It can be difficult, if not impossible, to get any work done in these types of office, though, according to data from devRant.\n\"There's so many distractions; co-workers stopping to talk, overhearing meetings and phone calls. There's also a multitude of complaints about things like the office coffee and the amenities -- or lack thereof,\" Fox says.\nThis one's self-explanatory. Everyone's got that particularly annoying co-worker who makes office life dreadful; for software developers, though, the most consistent complaints tend to be about the quality of a co-worker's code or their oversized ego that doesn't match up with their skills, Fox says.\nWhen developers do look for a job and get past the recruiter stage, there are a few consistently annoying aspects of interviews they tend to complain about, says Fox.\n\"We see complaints about being asked stupid questions, being asked to solve tech and coding problems that they'd never encounter in the real world, and having the interviewer not understand exactly what it is they do,\" Fox says.\nSoftware developers deal with bugs and errors on a daily basis, so it's a bit surprising that they're not first on the list. Fox has a hypothesis about the issue; for developers, bugs and errors are often resolved in a positive way, so there's not much of a reason to complain.\n\"Most other issues don't have such a positive resolution, but bugs and errors are solvable and it feels good to do that, so the rants we do see are pretty positive,\" he says.\nQuality assurance (QA) is a critical part of software development, but QA engineers are subject to the same criticisms many developers level at product/project managers, says Fox.\n\"QA gets a crack at the product after the developers and engineers have finished it, so often times they don't understand the project's constraints, the work-arounds, the challenges and obstacles the developers ran into when they were building it. We also see a lot of complaints about QA asking developers to go back and rework parts of the code that they [the QA team] should be able to handle themselves,\" Fox says.", "Are Armed Robbers Placing Apraku of NPP Life\u2019s in Danger?\nThe sheer audacity by armed robbers in Ghana to execute their crimes at any time of the day and on any target of their choosing is very scary. We hear of innocent Ghanaians\u2019 homes being raided and at times killed by the intrepid robbers. How they choose their target can be anyone\u2019s guess.\nI have read how the office of my own Tweneboah Kodua Secondary Schoolmate, Dr Kwabena Konadu Apraku, has on three occasions been targeted by these daring but completely notorious murderers. Luckily, each time they descended on his office or house at Kumasi Tanoso, intending to execute their allegedly heinous ultimate punishment on him, he would be away elsewhere in the country.\nMuch as I do not wish any ill fate on Dr Apraku at the hands of any armed robbers, I find his supposition linking the incidents to his utterances against Nana Akufo Addo and his desire to contest future NPP flagbearership very unfortunate and ill-thought. He strongly believes they are not any mere coincident but deliberate ploys by certain supporters of Nana Akufo Addo to eliminate him.\nI wish he named those he thinks are behind the armed raids on his office/home to facilitate police investigations into the unfortunate incidents which could have possibly culminated in his death if he was around and happened to be the prime target.\nHis allusion that the incidents emanate from his irresponsible attacks on Nana Akufo Addo sounds weird in my ears. How would anyone want to eliminate him simply because he wants to contest Nana Akufo Addo for the NPP flagbearership? Even in the likely event of him being able to defeat Nana in such a contest, nobody would dream of eliminating him, let alone, where he could not get a tenth of the votes Nana would garner.\nMany are those presuming he is only using age and these incidents to smear Nana but no matter what he does, it will not wash. Nana is currently the people\u2019s choice regardless of his age. At his age, he has still never been corrupt but remains dynamic, honest and dedicated to being of service to his country and humanity.\nI really sympathise with Dr Apraku. The police should expedite work on identifying and nailing all those orchestrating that dangerous armed robbery on him, an alumni \u201cAkyeremah\u201d of Kumawu Tweneboah Koduah Secondary School, in the hope of damaging Nana Akufo Addo.\nHow will the supporters and Dr Apraku feel if one turned round to accuse them of having staged the incursions just to blame them on Nana Akufo Addo or other members of the NPP? Are the members of the NPP not destroying the party\u2019s chances of ever winning the presidency without anyone usurping them as obviously done in Election 2012?\nFor acquiring their parochial interests, some NPP members will go any length to tarnish the reputation of Nana Addo. However, try as they do, the old man, David in waiting to floor Goliath, will never budge but still remain stronger.\nI strongly advise the opponents and enemies of Nana Akufo Addo to campaign on policies but not on senseless arguments of one\u2019s age \u2013 he is too old.", "\"Several young people\" are facing criminal charges of burglary and trespassing, according to a Facebook post from Benton County Sheriff's Office.\nWATAB \u2014 Benton County Sheriff's Office is voicing adamant warning to residents following a recent trend of people found trespassing on old abandoned or run-down buildings and posting their illegal adventures on social media.\nThe sheriff said the handful of trespassing incidents have been focused near an abandoned commercial building in Watab Township. According to a post on the sheriff's Facebook page, people have been entering the building, recording themselves there and posting the video to social media.\n\"I would say about a month ago we started getting complaints about neighbors seeing individuals coming and going there,\" said Sheriff Troy Heck. \"We started giving it some extra patrol, paying attention to the area.\"\nHeck said deputies have started to meet people coming and going from that area in the last couple of weeks. Wednesday night, the Facebook post said, was the latest incident where \"several young people\" were trespassing in the building. They are now facing criminal charges of burglary and trespassing, the post said.\n\"Some people just don\u2019t seem to grasp the idea of private property just because somewhere looks abandoned or run down,\" Heck said.\nAt the very least, being found on this property warrants a trespassing charge, if not an additional burglary charge, said Heck. \"If someone were to go in this building without consent and damage something, that\u2019s a felony crime.\"\nThis is not the first time the sheriff's office has run into issues of trespassing. More often it's on vacant farmland or abandoned homes, he said, by people looking to steal old metal or equipment.\nIn addition to the potential legal issues, these abandoned buildings pose significant danger to the people trespassing there. Heck said there are often safety hazards that don't immediately meet the eye in these run-down, unkempt places.\n\"There are a lot of hidden dangers these people going in have no knowledge of,\" he said. \"Regardless of how tempting it might look on social media or exciting it might seem to somebody, this is a serious crime and could be a dangerous situation to them.\"\nHeck encourages residents of Watab Township and Benton County to report any suspicious activity when they see it.\n\"Right away,\" Heck said. \"Sometimes we have people tell us they didn\u2019t want to bother us\u2026we want to be bothered.\"", "A top executive says the company will be \"ruthless\" about cutting costs, but declines to comment on speculation about more layoffs.\nNEW YORK--A top Dell Computer executive said Thursday that the company will be \"ruthless\" about cutting costs, but declined to comment on speculation about more layoffs.\nSpeaking at a Merrill Lynch technology conference, Tom Meredith, senior vice president of business development and strategy, said Dell plans to cut costs further because that's the company's best advantage against its rivals.\n\"We will be ruthless about how we adjust our cost structure going forward,\" Meredith said.\nAsked whether that statement meant more layoffs are on deck, Meredith said the company \"won't comment on rumors.\" Although Meredith didn't rule out additional layoffs, he added that Dell will look at \"areas that haven't been attacked.\"\nDell shares were down $1.80, or 7 percent, to $24.93 at market close.\nThe PC giant will look to cut costs through transportation and logistics, warranty terms and productivity enhancements, he said.\nDell's plan for success has been to tackle commodity tech markets such as PCs and then beat the competition by being more efficient. Meredith acknowledged that the company eased off its cost-cutting last year and stumbled. \"We had to cut costs to regain our advantage,\" he said. \"We are going for growth now.\"\nCost reductions will be essential for Dell to preserve profits as it works to gain market share. The Round Rock, Texas-based company has been boosting market share and cutting PC prices for the last six to nine months, Meredith said.\nThe efforts seem to be bearing fruit. Dell has become the top dog in the worldwide computing market, encompassing both PCs and servers, according to market researcher Dataquest.\nCompaq Chief Executive Michael Capellas said his company is up to the challenge.\n\"We will be much more aggressive on pricing,\" he said. \"The price war will continue.\"\nWhen asked whether Compaq could compete with Dell on prices, Capellas said it could because it's better at managing inventory. He added that component prices have declined in recent months and that 45 percent of the company's sales were made directly to customers.\nNews of the price war was enough to prompt UBS Warburg to downgrade Dell from \"strong buy\" to a \"buy.\"\n\"We remain concerned about Dell's continued price aggression, and we lack confidence that the PC industry's sacrifice of short-term profitability will lead to long-term gains,\" said UBS analyst Don Young.\n\"On the pricing front, we eventually expect Gateway to become more aggressive, and we understand Compaq is now matching Dell's pricing,\" Young said.\nMeredith said he wouldn't comment on Dell's first-quarter results because the company's quarter closes Friday at midnight. Dell, which reports earnings May 17, is expected to report a profit of 17 cents a share on sales of $8.04 billion.\nDell may enter the handheld market once that field evolves, but don't expect anything soon, Meredith said. The company sees that market becoming a commodity; and when it converges on one dominant operating system and information technology departments buy systems in bulk, Dell will become interested.\nIT departments' volume purchases of Research In Motion's BlackBerry pager are a step in the right direction, but it's too early to predict winners, he said.\n\"Right now the PDA (personal digital assistant) market is driven by the individual--there's not a lot of profit there, and no real winner has emerged,\" Meredith said. \"Until a standard emerges, there's no need to enter the market. Why pick now when you could be wrong?\"\nA deal with Advanced Micro Devices is also not in the near future, Meredith said, echoing a statement by AMD CEO Jerry Sanders on Wednesday. Meredith said that using AMD chips may create too much complexity with outsourcing partners and other behind-the-scenes functions such as procurement.\nUntil there's a \"significant disparity between price and performance\" with AMD and Intel chips, Meredith said Dell will stick with Intel. \"It doesn't mean AMD is a bad company, but it doesn't give us a significant leveraged advantage,\" he said.", "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 The president of Shell Oil Co. said Tuesday exploratory drilling off Alaska's northwest coast is going well despite stormy weather last week that caused the company to halt operations for a few days.\nAnd in an interview with The Associated Press Marvin Odum said he expects further protests against the company's plans for Arctic drilling like the ones in Seattle and Portland where activists in kayaks tried to block Shell vessels.\nArctic offshore drilling is bitterly opposed by environmental groups that say a spill cannot be cleaned in ice-choked waters and that industrial activity will harm polar bears, walrus and ice seals already harmed by diminished sea ice.\nIn Seattle, Shell faced protests on the water by \"kayaktivists\" upset over the company staging equipment in the city. In Portland, Oregon, Greenpeace USA protesters hung from the St. Johns Bridge to delay a Shell support vessel, from heading to the Arctic.\n\"I think the right assumptions for me to make are, it's not going to go away,\" Odum said. \"We saw quite a bit of very public opposition when we were in the Pacific Northwest.\"\nOdum said he's \"110 percent ready\" to work with people who want to find ways to improve drilling.\n\"I do have an issue with those that oppose who use illegal means or put the safety of themselves or the safety of anybody associated with this operation at risk,\" he said.\nOdum said good progress is being made on the first well off Alaska's northwest coast.\n\"We had a few days in the last week where we couldn't operate because of the weather,\" he said. \"Now we're coming out of that and it looks like we're moving into a time period of good weather.\"\nPresident Barack Obama this week is in Alaska rallying support for measures to combat climate change, such as limits on carbon emissions.\nOdum is staying in the same hotel as the president \u2014 the Hotel Captain Cook.\nWhile environmentalists praise the president for curbing greenhouse gases, they pillory him for granting Shell permission to drill in the Chukchi Sea for the first time in 24 years.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey estimates the Chukchi and Beaufort seas hold 26 billion barrels of recoverable oil.\nOil will continue to be needed as the United States transitions to more renewable energy, Odum said.\n\"Oil will be required for a long time,\" Odum said. \"Let's take a really close look at developing our own resources, control how it's done and get all the benefits that go along with it.\"\nShell in two years of exploratory drilling and with up to six wells hopes to confirm a vast reservoir of oil. If it's found, Shell could apply for production permits and move oil by undersea pipe to the Alaska shore and then overland across northern Alaska to the trans-Alaska pipeline. That could take more than a decade.\nOdum is confident exploration can be done safely, and the overriding factor dictating whether Shell completes an exploratory well this year will be safety.\nShell is operating under strict Arctic rules put in place after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Arctic offshore drilling has been scrutinized in the courts in lawsuits brought by drilling opponents, Odum said.\n\"It's probably fair to say, this is the most scrutinized, analyzed project \u2014 oil and gas project \u2014 probably anywhere in the world. I'm actually sure of that,\" he said.\nAll the scrutiny, along with Shell's own internal review, have gone into safety considerations. It's in the company's best interest, he said.\n\"We can't afford to have a problem here,\" Odum said.", "Kelly JohnsonThe Zena Road Races offer three hilly courses.\nHow many runners have asked that question when evaluating a potential training run or race? I know I have. For some runners, it's just part of the preparation process: if it's hilly, they'll swap their intervals for some hill repeats or make sure to train on a route that includes some incline. For others, hills mean only fear and pain.\nWhich runner are you? If you're the first kind, what are some workouts you do to help prepare? Let us know!\nI asked ChiRunning Coach Alice Peters Diffely what she would tell a runner who fits into that second group. Her advice to that runner would be: \"Hills are FUN. And with proper technique, you can navigate them without suffering short-term pain or long-term injury.\"\nRunOregon: Why does the ChiRunning technique work on hills? Biomechanically, what are the advantages?\nAlice: ChiRunning offers variations to the technique, depending on the type of hill you are approaching. In the standard ChiRunning form on flat terrain, the aim is to run from the core. But to the extent that the peripheral muscles are involved, we want to derive 50% of the muscular effort from the legs and 50% from the arms. It's a balanced approach. By contrast, most runners in our culture rely overwhelmingly on leg strength, making them vulnerable to a whole host of leg injuries.\nWithin the uphill and downhill techniques, there are also variations depending on the steepness of the hill. We view gradual uphills as \"runnable\" hills, keeping the stride length short to avoid overworking the legs, while adjusting our arm position to help harness the power of the upper body to help move us up the hill. A hill that is steep enough you feel inclined to rise up on your toes to climb we consider to be a \"non-runnable\" hill. We use a technique called the lateral stride, which is somewhat similar to side-stepping up the side of a mountain on skis. Again, we keep the stride length very short to avoid over-taxing the lower legs, while putting more emphasis on using the power of the arms to tackle the steep hill.\nRunOregon: On a scale of 1-5, 1 being easy and 5 being very hard, how hard is it to learn and employ this technique?\nbasics. The hill techniques are part of the material covered in the final hour of the workshop. Most participants pick up the hill techniques quite easily. The degree of difficulty to learn the techniques is maybe a 1 or a 2.\nLast November, a couple of participants in my ChiRunning workshop were scheduled to run the Seattle Marathon a few weeks later. We talked about the fact that there is a steep uphill somewhere around mile 20, which would provide an excellent opportunity to utilize the lateral stride. Both of those runners checked in with me shortly after the marathon and reported that by using the lateral stride, they had floated up that hill quite easily. They were then able to cruise through the final miles of the race.\nTo learn more about Alice or the ChiRunning technique, check out her website.", "Thanks to a genetic manipulation, three color-blind mice recently gained the ability to see the world in the same hues as humans do.\nMice and nonprimate mammals\u2014much like color-blind people\u2014see relatively few hues, because their retinas contain photoreceptors (cells with a light-sensing protein pigment) that only absorb blue (short) and green (medium) wavelengths of light. Scientists say that most primates, including humans, have a third receptor that also absorbs red, or long wavelengths, thanks to a primate ancestor who passed along a gene mutation for it an estimated 40 million years ago.\nAccording to Gerald Jacobs, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the research that allowed these mice to see in full color was an attempt \"to replicate what must have been the first stage in the evolution of primate color vision.\" The ability to see the world as humans do, he says, \"requires an additional sensor\u2014or photopigment\u2014and the nervous system being able to compare the signals.\"\nWould merely adding the new photoreceptor be enough to enable an animal to process new hues or is some brain rewiring\u2014which would take several successive generations to develop\u2014also be needed? The finding, published in this week's Science: new sensory input is all it takes to enhance vision from, say, a box of 16 to a box of 128 colors of crayons.\nJacobs, along with Jeremy Nathans, a professor of molecular biology and genetics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, trained mice, which had been genetically altered to have a full complement of photoreceptors, to distinguish differences in shades of color that normal mice would not notice.\nOnly female mice were used for the experiment, Jacobs says, because the genes that code for pigment proteins are located on the female, or X chromosome. Nathans' group engineered mice to have a human long-wavelength receptor gene in place of their medium-wavelength receptor. After they were bred with normal mice, the male offspring (which carry only one X chromosome, as opposed to two in females) ended up with either all medium- or all long-wavelength photoreceptor cells, but never a mix of both, in their retinas.\nSome of the female mice, however, ended up with genes for both photoreceptors: a medium wavelength gene on one X chromosome and a long wavelength one on the other. In each cell in the female body, one of the X chromosomes is randomly inactivated to eliminate redundancy. Some of the cells in the retina will inactivate the chromosome coding for long-wavelength receptors, whereas others will silence the medium-wavelength receptor gene. Thus, some retina cells will have medium-wavelength photopigment and others will produce the long-wavelength variety.\nResearchers then exposed the mutant, female mice to a light-discrimination test involving three colored panels\u2014two of similar hues and the other differing in brightness or shading. After a significant training period\u2014the researchers conducted well over 10,000 trials, rewarding mice who singled out the odd panel with a drop of soy-milk\u2014three mice with the full complement of photo receptors were able to correctly finger the different panel 80 percent of the time. Normal mice, on the other hand, were only successful about one third of the time, a percentage equivalent to just randomly guessing.\nJacobs points out that not all of the mutant mice were able to successfully complete the color discrimination test, which he says could indicate how species deal with newly introduced abilities during evolution. He adds that the next step will be to determine how the brain incorporates the new color signals and makes the comparisons necessary to distinguish between different shades. \"What this shows is that not only can you expand the range in which animals can sense stimuli,\" he asserts,\" but they can derive a new dimension of sensory experience.\"", "\"Africa is solidly behind Blatter.,\" said Kwesi Nyantakyi, the president of the Ghana FA.\nNyantakyi, who is also a Confederation of African Football executive committee member added: \"You will find he is very popular on the continent.\"\nOn 29 May, Blatter will seek a fifth term as president that will take him past his 80th birthday.\nDutch football association president Michael van Praag announced on Tuesday his intention to run following similar moves by former Fifa deputy secretary general Jerome Champagne and Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein of Jordan.\nFormer France international David Ginola has also announced his intention to stand but his is widely regarded as being no more than a publicity stunt.\nBut Blatter's prospective opponents are likely to get little support from the 53 African voters.\n\"The continent is united behind him,\" added former South African FA president Molefi Oliphant, who still serves on the Caf executive.\n\"We made a formal endorsement of his candidacy last year at our meeting in Rio de Janeiro already.\"\nPrevious endorsements from Caf, however, have not necessarily translated into votes.\nAfrican football's controlling body promised Lennart Johansson a block of votes in 1998 but member associations took no heed and helped Blatter to victory.\nIn 2002 Caf president Issa Hayatou failed to muster significant support from his own continent and lost heavily to Blatter.\nAffection for Blatter stems from the generous financial assistance he has given Africa during his 17-year tenure.\n\"He has done a lot for the continent. It is he who has set up the financial assistance programmes and who through the Goal project has built infra structure in all of the countries,\" added Nyantakyi.\n\"The Europeans don't understand that.

And the children had to be led by the hand.\nThey were carried away like people being taken to the gallows. I would later learn that all of them died, except one.\nThe sight of a girl among them, probably five years old, has never faded from my memory.\nWhenever I give my two-year-old daughter Anna her daily morning hug, or send her to sleep at night, memories have flashed back of the girl in the doorway who looked weak and emaciated even from a distance.\nI have developed a natural thermometer - the back of my hand - to check body temperatures, mine and the children's.\nThe traditional thermometer resembles a syringe and scares my daughter, so I use my hand. It is a routine I have never needed before.\nWhen I drive and get stuck in traffic, it has become instinctive for me to place the back of my hand on my temple, neck and wrist.\nI pull the rear mirror to see if I do not have red-shot eyes - one of the signs of Ebola - and tend to repeat that process several times at home.\nIntermittently, I grab my viral gels to disinfect my hands just in case I may have come into contact with an infected person.\nAs a journalist, I have covered civil wars in which I was shot in the legs and violent elections in which I was a target.\nBut I have never felt as frightened and as close to death as I have while covering the current Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.\nI believe in eyewitness journalism, where possible, but the nature of the Ebola coverage has forced me to exercise restraint.\nThe virus moves through human bodily fluids and, as a broadcast journalist, the windshield on the microphone could be a conduit for the spittle of someone who has the virus.\nThat is besides the fact that I could make a mistake and touch an infected person. As a result, my movement is highly restricted.\nSierra Leone is a malaria-prone country and, as a consequence, fever is a fairly common condition.\nThe plasmodium parasite is the biggest killer of the country's children and has sent many adults to the world beyond.\nSince the Ebola outbreak, it is amazing to witness the relief of parents whose child has been diagnosed with malaria.\nThese days hospitals here - both public and private - are effectively closed to non-Ebola patients.\nAt home we have abundant supplies of gloves, second only to foodstuff, for emergencies like a fever.\nOne of the biggest scares I have had throughout this crisis was when Anna fell ill. Her temperature shot up to 37 degrees Celsius.\nA paediatrician later gave us advice and prescription on the phone to treat her.

It transpired that my pain was caused by ulcers.\nEvery feeling of fever or stomach pain these days is treated as suspicious.\nMy children are locked in a virtual prison. With schools closed nationwide because of the outbreak, I stopped my eight-year-old son from attending Islamic school for the same reason.\nThey spend days inside our gated compound with no direct contact with the outside world. And they are required to wash their hands regularly.\nAfter a bitter disagreement, my wife and I agreed to send our housemaid away - with pay - until the situation improves.\nThe kids in the doorway of the Kenema Ebola clinic are just the tip of the iceberg.\nAs of 16 December, 373 children had been lost their lives to the virus in Sierra Leone, according to the UN Ebola mission.

I do this by being home for most of the day - and showing my children more love and giving them more attention.\nEbola will leave us one day.

Chief among them was how NPR referred to the now-dead gunman, a white man.\nAs has been the case with all major news-garnering attacks that involved white men in recent years, some in the NPR audience immediately insisted that NPR should be calling the event \"domestic terrorism.\" NPR has not used that term. It did, however, repeatedly quote Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo's reference to the killer as a \"lone wolf.\" That juxtaposition in particular drew criticism from some listeners.\nOn the NPR Ombudsman Facebook page, a listener named Sean McGovern set off a lively discussion with his post: \"Enough with the 'lone wolf' talk. Call domestic terrorism what it is.\"\nLegal and other definitions are important, and NPR had a good on-air discussion of \"domestic terrorism\" this week. But what NPR's critics are really arguing about is something different: At their core, the complaints are about whether NPR has been consistent in how it treats attackers who are white versus those who are Muslim, or brown or immigrants (or all three). If it is using the words \"terrorism\" mostly in connection with attacks perpetrated by minorities, the argument goes, NPR would be perpetuating stereotypes.\nThese are not inconsequential considerations. Stereotypes can carry serious consequences and should be avoided.\nMark Memmott, the editor who oversees standards and practices in NPR's newsroom, told me this week that his approach remains the same as it has been: NPR uses action words to describe what a person does. And, he said, \"We have to wait to see what information develops about the motivation of the person.\" He added, \"Maybe we're too cautious,\" but he also rightly notes that this considered approach has served NPR well in the past, as in the April bombing of a soccer team's bus in Germany, which some (but not NPR) immediately labeled terrorism, when in fact it turned out that the bomber had a profit motive.\nThe main question for me, then, is whether NPR itself has been consistent. Some other news outlets and some officials are indeed quick to throw around the terrorism label, but NPR cannot answer to what decisions are made by other news organizations. I judge these issues by NPR's standards, and whether it is living up to the journalism best practices it espouses.\nFor the most part, NPR has been consistent; it rarely uses \"terrorist\" or \"terrorism\" in the early days of reporting on any attacks, except when officials have first used it. That applied to the Pulse nightclub shooting in June 2016 and to Charlottesville in August, when a woman was killed after being hit by a car at a rally. The newsroom should continue to be cautious in this way.\nThe use or avoidance of \"lone wolf\" is a slightly less clear-cut decision for me. In this case, it was first used in a quote from law enforcement, so that argues in favor of at least a few uses early on. But that in and of itself is not enough of a justification to keep repeating it, as NPR did throughout the day.\nFor one thing, as a few listeners pointed out, the phrase can be seen as romanticizing the shooter (so could calling someone a \"domestic terrorist,\" for that matter). It is also clich\u00e9. And, Memmott noted, NPR should avoid police jargon. There are much better ways of saying that the killer acted alone, including that very phrase.\nThe \"lone wolf\" phrase also has racist undertones. As Monica Hoel of Emory, Va., wrote my office: \"If he's a white guy, call him a white guy. I've never heard a shooter with a Muslim-sounding name called Lone Wolf. I've never heard a shooter with an African American heritage called a Lone Wolf. Lone Wolf sounds like a Kiefer Sutherland character. I count on NPR to not contribute to bias.\"\nI looked back in NPR's archives and NPR has indeed, more than once, quoted officials who use the phrase \"lone wolf\" to refer to attackers who are apparently Muslim, including the attacker at the Flint, Mich., airport in June. More commonly, the phrase is used by officials to refer to white attackers, however. NPR should largely avoid using it, in my opinion.\nAs with many newsroom ethics decisions, there is no right or wrong answer here. Here are some other takes on this subject, for consideration, from Masha Gessen in The New Yorker; Indira Lakshmanan, the Newmark chair in journalism ethics at The Poynter Institute, and Andrew Seaman, chairperson of the Ethics Committee of the Society of Professional Journalists, and a health reporter for Reuters.\nOverall, I found NPR's coverage of the Las Vegas massacre so far to be careful and considered. Compared to past breaking news situations, there were very few slipups when referring to the weapons involved (an ongoing challenge for NPR, which in the past has sometimes gotten the terminology wrong). NPR has been rightly judicious not to overuse the killer's name, while at the same time not avoiding it entirely.\nListeners raised a few other issues, however.\nMarlene Marshall, of Rhode Island, wrote: \"Once heard how does one let go of the horror of hearing people being shot? It feels to have attached itself to my brain and is not welcome.\"\nNPR did play audio of shots being fired. Most often, the show hosts were good about giving listeners a warning first, so those who wished not to hear that audio could tune away. But in the Up First podcast, the 5 a.m. newscast and again at 8:19 a.m., the shots audio played with no warning. In my opinion it should not have. One justification for using these clips has been in discussions of how the sound suggested the shooter was using an automatic weapon. Even so, that does not merit repeated use of what clearly is shocking audio.\nA \"Record\" Made To Be Broken?\nBecky Froass of Silver Spring, Md., wrote: \"I find it very frustrating that every story about the Las Vegas shooting, every mention, every interview, etc. must begin with the words 'the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.' I have heard that phrase 40 or 50 times since Monday morning and I think it is unnecessary, not to mention, redundant. Also, I believe it offers a 'challenge' to someone to try to make deadlier attack that may be the 'deadliest'. Why is this description necessary so constantly?\"\nWe got a number of similar complaints. Part of the challenge is that this listener (and others) seem to be listening to all the coverage; the average listener, however, tunes in for only a short period of time. NPR's journalists must program for them, too, and bring them up to speed quickly when they tune in seeking information.\nOf the phrase itself, Memmott told me: \"It certainly says something about the level of horror and, to get back to that other word, terror. The numbers are just stunning.\" As he notes, context is important, because \"one of our jobs is to contribute to the public discussion and give people the information they need to make informed decisions.\" I agree with his observation that, if NPR did not put it in some kind of context, NPR could find itself accused of making mass shootings seem even more routine than they are already becoming.\nHeather Williams of North Adams, Mass., wrote: \"What I'm hearing is your reporters talking about victims they know absolutely nothing about, giving me information that has clearly been gleaned by combing through relatives' and friends' Facebook posts and passed on, seemingly without permission from those relatives and friends.\"\nAnd a listener named Alexis, from Chelsea, Mich., wrote: \"I understand that in today's 24/7 news cycles that it's hard to get new information, but I believe reading people's personal Facebook posts on national radio crosses a line, regardless of whether or not the posts are viewable by the public or not. One thing is to quote a business or other public entity, but to quote people's private posts grieving a loved one is not journalism, regardless of if their permission was granted to share the post. We are not their intended audience. I do not think that most people know whether or not their Facebook posts are public, and yes, that is their error. However, I expect more from NPR.\"\nOne of the stories in question quoted a Facebook post from the mother of one of the victims. Memmott told me the newsroom attempted to reach the victim's mother to get her permission (and presumably an interview), but was unsuccessful, and decided to use the post, given that it was public. \"The old-fashioned part of me still wishes they were able to cross that final T,\" he said, but added that he understood the pressures of a deadline, and the desire to turn the focus away from the killer to the victims.\nSocial media is a potential landmine these days, as authenticity and privacy issues abound. Permission should have been sought, in my opinion.\nEditorial researcher Annie Johnson and intern Holly Pretsky contributed to this report.", "Azerbaijan next to join NATO?\n\"Earlier, the perception in both Brussels [North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] headquarters] and Baku was that Georgia should integrate into NATO first and Azerbaijan should follow,\" the source said. \"However, the situation has changed and it might be that in the year to come Azerbaijan will become the frontrunner. Baku may enter NATO earlier than Ukraine and Georgia.\"\nAfter Georgia\u2019s 2008 war with Russia, \"[m]any NATO member-states believe that . . . it is simply impossible to provide membership to Georgia,\" the source continued.\nUkraine\u2019s domestic divisions over NATO and political turmoil have reduced its membership chances, he said. \"It is unclear who will represent the Ukrainian government in six months or a year and what its position on NATO membership will be.\"\nBy comparison, Azerbaijan appears a bastion of stability. Among its other \"strong advantages\" are the country\u2019s \"strong cultural links\" with NATO member Turkey and its strategic importance for the planned Nabucco and TGI (Turkey-Greece-Italy) gas pipelines, projects which \"will deepen Western support [for] Azerbaijan in the coming years,\" according to the source.\nInterestingly, a large part of the reason Azerbaijan is now in a better spot for NATO membership is that its government never lobbied particularly hard to join. Ukraine and Georgia, where this has been a long-standing priority, invited both Russia and internal critics to try to prevent them from joining.\nFor a number of reasons explained in the article, Azerbaijan still has a long way to go before it can join, but it does seem as if the best way for ex-Soviet countries to join Nato might be to act like they don\u2019t actually want to.", "Almost a third of agents say term-time holiday fines are impacting sales of family holidays.\nNearly 60% cited rising prices, 31% said term-time fines and half reported Brexit as having an effect on family holiday sales in January.\nThe findings come from a poll of 337 agents carried out exclusively for Travel Weekly by supplier marketing organisation Tipto and follow official data from analyst GfK showing that family bookings for summer 2019 were outperforming the wider market.\nSchool absence figures for England will be released in March, but the latest data, for spring 2018, shows 8.6% were unauthorised family holidays and 1.6% were agreed holidays.

He expects the units to rent for about $1.50 per square foot, or $750 to $1,200.\n\u201cWe are pretty comfortable with that range,\u201d Barbat said.\nHe declined to say the purchase price, but said the entire project \u2014 including the cost of buying the building and the renovations \u2014 is expected to be $3.5 million to $4 million. Once financing and other approvals are received, construction can be completed within 10 to 14 months, he said.\nBarbat also said he has the 86,000-square-foot Phillip Neudeck office building, located at 415 Clifford St., under contract and plans to close on it within the next 30 days. He plans to convert it into 100 apartment units. The redevelopment, including the cost of the building, would be between $6.5 million and $7 million, he said.\n\u201cThe due diligence is finalized, and we are ready to go,\u201d he said.\nThe Detroit office of Jones Lang Lasalle is marketing the building for sale.\nThe starting bid at the St. Regis building auction, which began April 21 and ended April 23, was $300,000. It had been owned by St. Regis Sky Group LLC \u2014 an entity registered to Deepak Bhalla, vice president of operations for Detroit-based Lakeshore Healthcare Group.\nAccording to Ryan Snoek, a Detroit real estate consultant who was the listing broker on the sale, the 225-room Hotel St. Regis is not affected by the sale. He said during an April interview with Crain's that the building, which was built in 1987, would need substantial renovation.\nThe first floor of the six-story vacant building could be used for restaurant or banquet space, the Auction.com listing said.\nThe hotel is owned by Shirley Wilson of Southfield, according to Washington, D.C.-based real estate information service CoStar Group Inc. It was sold in 2011 for $850,000 to Wilson, one of the group of investors who renovated and reopened the hotel in 2007.\nHerbert Strather, CEO of Strather Academy and Strather Associates in Detroit, led the redevelopment team. In February 2009, two years after the renovation, the hotel defaulted on a loan from Chicago-based Shorebank Corp.\nAfter Shorebank shut down the hotel in August 2010, much of its $2.2 billion in assets and $1.5 billion in deposits \u2014 including the Hotel St. Regis \u2014 were bought by a new entity, Urban Partnership Bank.\nThe hotel was then put up for auction by Southfield-based turnaround firm BBK in January 2011.

Moses is a black man who grew up in southern Dallas and has faced his share of racism. I told Moses I was sorry for what he was going through. I told him I wanted to understand. I told him I was joining a book club on race.\nMoses said, \"Ryan, that's great. I'm glad you're doing that. But I have to tell you; that's a very white, suburban, college-educated way to approach this problem. You're going to read a book. What you really need to do is come to the barbershop with me.\"\nWhat Moses was telling me is that my approach to the issue of race relations needed to be more than academic. I needed to live it. I needed to bring my whole being to the project: body and soul, not just mind.\nHalf an hour before Grammy award-winning gospel singer Marvin Winans took the stage at the Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas Thursday night, he offered a similar perspective.\n\"Most whites, no matter how empathetic they are, they have never lived it,\" Winans said, sitting in front of a piano in his green room. \"They don't know what it is to go down the street and be pulled over simply because you're black. They don't know what it is to walk into a grocery store and have people follow you down the aisle to see if you're stealing anything.\"\nWinans headlined an event called Gospel Goes Classical featuring the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and a 200-voice choir with representatives from 40 North Texas churches, synagogues and mosques. The event was a fundraiser for Project Unity, a faith-based nonprofit promoting what it calls \"safe conversations\" about race, founded by Richie Butler, pastor of St. Paul United Methodist Church. And judging by the shouts, applause and lifted hands, the 2,000-member audience was participating mind, body and soul. Women waved programs like fans and when Winans intoned \"Draw me, my Jesus\" someone shouted, \"Yes, Lord!\"\n\"Music has the ability to make us think and feel the same things,\" Winans said.

Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas.\nAfter the 2016 shooting that killed five Dallas police officers, Butler's organization launched a \"year of unity\" that has lasted more than two years. Project Unity has sponsored dozens of events with that theme. Together We Pray is a weekly prayer meeting for clergy. Together We Ball is a community basketball game featuring Dallas police, pastors and community leaders. Together We Sing is an interfaith musical event held during the State Fair of Texas with a 100-voice choir. And Together We Dine is a series of dinners that put strangers of diverse backgrounds at a common table. Those dinners have been hosted by several churches, including Highland Park United Methodist and Preston Hollow Presbyterian, as well as organizations like AT&T and the Dallas Bar Association. Butler said some of those tables have spawned friendships that have lasted for years.\n\"These are people that probably would never have connected or had a relationship if not for that event,\" Butler said. \"Unfortunately, as a pastor, I can say that religion hasn't always been a unifying vehicle. We want to change that. We're focused on organic transformation, one conversation at a time.\"\nThat's a message that Larry and Glendoria Boyd, retired missionaries who attend Great Commission Baptist Church in Fort Worth, can support. They bought their tickets to Gospel Goes Classical as soon as they heard about the event.\n\"I have followed the Winans for 40 years,\" Larry said during the show's intermission. \"I remember Marvin's parents, Mom and Pop Winans. I was pleased to hear about Project Unity because we certainly need unity.\"\nInside the sold-out hall, Winans delivered a barrel-chested crescendo to \"What a Friend We Have In Jesus\" while guest conductor Jeri Lynne Johnson motioned emphatically to the 60-piece orchestra. In the choir loft above them, men in tuxedos and women in brightly colored gowns sang a tribute to Aretha Franklin. When the final song crescendoed with the lyrics, \"Together we stand, divided we fall. Let's build a bridge and tear down a wall\" the crowd roared to its feet.\nBack in the green room, Winans returned to the theme of the power of music. He told a story about performing at a birthday party for Maya Angelou at Mar-a-Lago, years before President Donald Trump's political career began. Trump's son Barron was a preschooler. He danced all through the concert. After the show, Trump approached Winans. \"He likes you,\" Trump said, indicating Barron. \"He was sitting still until you started singing.\"\n\"Music has that ability,\" Winans said, his elbow clanging black and white keys on the green room piano. \"When there's this determination to build walls, we need to step back and say a bridge serves a greater purpose.\"", "Corning&apos;s next iteration of Gorilla Glass could combine the best of both worlds in scratch and drop resistance. Source: Corning Incorporated.\nIf you&apos;ve ever suffered the horror of shattering or scratching the cover glass on your smartphone, Corning Incorporated has some great news for you.\nAnd no, Corning isn&apos;t suddenly getting into the sapphire cover business. In fact, quite the opposite: At Corning&apos;s 2015 annual investor meeting last week, the glass maker revealed it&apos;s working hard to render pure sapphire displays obsolete.\nTo be sure, just over a year ago, Corning stock was plunging after sapphire producerGT Advanced Technologies announced a multi-year agreementwith Apple to produce and supply the super hard material for the tech giant&apos;s then-unspecified iProducts. We now know sapphire was meant to at least cover two variations of the Apple Watch-- thanks in no small part to its superior scratch resistance -- but investors couldn&apos;t help but wonder whether sapphire posed a legitimate threat to Corning&apos;s widely used Gorilla Glass.\nHowever, it became clear that wasn&apos;t the case when GT Advanced Technologies descended into bankruptcy late last year, hurt by the weight of the deal, which was structured heavily in Apple&apos;s favor. What&apos;s more, shortly after theiPhone 6 was announced without a sapphire display, an IDC analyst&apos;s channel checks revealed part of the reason for the material&apos;s absence was that sapphire-covered iPhones \"repeatedly cracked during standard drop tests conducted by Apple suppliers.\" When given the choice of a device with superior scratch resistance, or one able to survive a catastrophic drop, it&apos;s no surprise Apple opted to stick with the latter.\nCorning won&apos;t stop thereIt&apos;s also unsurprising that Corning wouldn&apos;t be content to rest on its laurels and wait for another Gorilla Glass competitor to arrive. By offering the best of both worlds with whatever commercialized product comes out of Project Phire, Corning should be able to secure a virtual stranglehold on the cover glass industry going forward.\nOf course, keep in mind Clappin also only said the Project Phire material has \"scratch resistance approaching sapphire\" (emphasis mine). This indicates it still doesn&apos;t quite match sapphire just yet on the scratch front, but it should suffice for most consumers knowing Corning is closing the gap between the two while still maintaining the superior drop-handling ability of Gorilla Glass 4.\nWhat&apos;s more, keeping in mind Gorilla Glass 4 includes significant improvements over each of the prior three Gorilla Glass iterations, you can bet Corning will continue plowing R&D funds into further improving Project Phire going forward.\nIn the meantime, the Project Phire product will likely be released later this year as another variation of Gorilla Glass, especially given the impressive brand power that already comes with the primate-centric moniker. Clappin noted, for example, that one of Corning&apos;s leading Asian customers recently told them some Chinese speakers even believe \"Gorilla\" is the American word for glass.\nOver the long term, that obviously bodes well for Corning&apos;s Specialty Materials segment, revenue from which is already expected to increase 10% year over year this quarter, driven by healthy demand and pricing power for Gorilla Glass 4.If Corning can indeed follow through on its promise to commercialize developments of Project Phire by the end of 2015, it should serve to only further sustain that momentum.\nThe article Corning Is About to Make Sapphire Displays Obsolete originally appeared on Fool.com.\nSteve Symington owns shares of Apple.

The takeover could allow Pfizer to escape relatively high US corporate tax rates by moving its headquarters to Allergan's Dublin base.\nThe merged company will be the world's biggest drug maker by sales.

This means the profits of the new company would be subject to corporation tax of 12.5% - much lower than the 35% Pfizer pays in the US.\nLast year, Pfizer made an offer to buy AstraZeneca in a move that analysts said was designed to reduce Pfizer's tax bill.

The half-day workshop consists of three sessions designed both to enhance participants\u2019 care giving skills and to help congregations explore ways to expand their caring ministry.\n\u201cThis has been a tremendous help to me as there are at any given time people who may not need professional counseling but just someone to come along side of them and care for them. In addition, as our ordained leadership in our churches is male, this has been a valuable way to care for women in our congregation.\u201d said Cal Boroughs, pastor of St. Elmo Presbyterian Church.\nThe workshop is sponsored by Stephen Ministries, the St. Louis-based Christian training organization that has been providing congregations with training and resources for Christian caregiving since 1975. The workshop will be led by Galen Dalrymple, a Stephen Leader from Atlanta.\n\"The second session provides an introduction to the Stephen Series, a system of lay caring ministry through which congregation leaders can equip members to provide one-to-one Christian care to people in need,\" organizers said.\nSince 1975, more than 12,000 congregations representing more than 170 denominations have implemented the Stephen Series.\nOver the past 3 years, 12 members of St Elmo Presbyterian Church have undertaken 50 hours of training to become Stephen Ministers. They meet weekly with someone who is experiencing a life crisis or challenge, such as the death of a loved one, divorce, hospitalization, the loss of a job, loneliness, or relocation.\n\u201cPersonally, I have found this ministry extremely meaningful to participate in. It is so special to care for someone so intentionally, and for them to know you are there for as long as they need you. When someone's going through a hard time, it can make a huge difference to know there's someone you can talk to and be real with.\u201d said Katrina Fortune, a Stephen Minister at St. Elmo Presbyterian Church.\n\"The final session of the workshop explains 'How to Care in a Distinctively Christian Way.'

Now, new research shows that they also fly along with some of the highest levels ever measured for some flame retardants.\nAll nineteen commercial airliners in a new study had several flame retardants in their dust. And one chemical was measured at concentrations more than one hundred times higher in the airplane dust than in dust collected from homes and offices.\nWhether flight attendants, pilots, and cleaning crews face any health risks from the chemicals is unknown. But researchers worry that long hours breathing recycled cabin air could have some effects, particularly in pregnant women.\n\"The additional exposure to the common passenger, occurring during travels, will be minimal. A question of concern is rather personnel in airplanes,\u201d said \u00c5ke Bergman, an environmental chemist at Stockholm University who has studied flame retardants on airliners.\nDespite the sky-high levels of flame retardants in cabin air, a small study of flight attendants and pilots suggests they don't seem to have higher levels in their bodies than the general public. However, scientists say the most prevalent flame retardant on airplanes is difficult to measure in people's bodies.\nAirplanes are full of combustible materials, and a mid-flight fire could be catastrophic, so the Federal Aviation Administration requires airplanes to pass strict fire-safety tests. Items on planes likely to contain brominated flame retardants include seats, carpets, walls, overhead bins, and pillows, according to the new study's x-ray fluorescence tests. Carpets contained the highest levels of bromine in the study.\nUnder fire in recent years, flame retardants have been building up in human bodies, including breast milk, around the world, and there is mounting evidence linking them to potential health effects, including reduced IQs, attention problems, and other neurological effects in children exposed in the womb or during infancy.\nChemical companies say that flame retardants are safe and that they are necessary to protect people from fires on airplanes. An August, 2005 crash of a passenger jet in Toronto, in which all 309 people aboard survived, is a prime example of how flame retardants can help keep people safe, said Bryan Goodman, spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, an industry group.\n\"This new study, which does not report on any adverse health effects from the chemistries detected, should not make us lose sight of the fact that flame retardants can provide an important layer of protection to travelers, and, like all chemicals, they are subject to review by governmental bodies in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d Goodman said.\nVictoria Day, a spokesperson for Airlines for America, an industry group, said flame retardants \"are essential\" for safety and to comply with \"strict FAA safety regulations.\"\n\"To maintain high air quality in aircraft cabins, today's jets have highly effective filters that are designed to remove virtually all particles, including dust, from the cabin air,\" Day said.\nBut some research suggests that flame retardants may not actually slow the spread of fires and may increase emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, two poisonous gases. \"Fire is a significant concern when you're 10,000 feet in the air, but I think it boils down to the question of how effective are these chemicals at retarding fire?\" Stapleton said. \"The data I've seen recently for use in furniture has not convinced me that they would actually provide significant escape time.\"\nAirliners manufactured by Boeing, Airbus, Canadair Regional, McDonnell Douglas, and Embraer were analyzed for flame retardants in the study by scientists from Harvard University, Duke, and two other institutions. Dust was vacuumed from the carpet and air return grilles on the wall near the floor of airplanes manufactured between 1986 and 2008.\nConcentrations of DecaBDE, a brominated flame retardant known as Deca that is used mostly for electronics, wire and cable insulation, and textiles, were \"orders of magnitude higher than what is typically found in U.S. homes and offices,\" the researchers wrote. For example, the average level in airplane dust was 495,000 parts per billion, while in home dust it was 4,500 and in office dust, 4,200.\nDeca is being phased out by the end of this year in the United States. Little is known about what, if any, health risk it poses to humans. However, animal studies have linked Deca to damage to the liver, thyroid, reproductive system, and developing brain. Based on animal studies, it is classified as a possible human carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency.\nAfter a cross-country flight, the hands of nine flight attendants and one passenger contained high levels of Deca compared to the general public.\nA newer flame retardant, HBCD, also was found in airplanes at higher levels than in US homes. Others were found at similar concentrations as homes.\nOne veteran flight attendant said that she and her colleagues are concerned that they are exposed to many contaminants and other health threats on airplanes. \u201cOf course I'm concerned. I just don\u2019t know what to do other than to quit,\u201d said the flight attendant, who has worked for a major airline for several decades. She asked that her name be withheld. \"We get exposed to a lot of stuff...You're sitting in recycled air.\" On long flights, \"by the end of the day that air is really used up.\"\nResearch in airplanes is relatively new. The first study to show that concentrations of brominated flame retardants (PBDEs) in dust from airplanes are higher than in homes was published in 2008. More recent studies have supported that finding, showing that PBDEs in cabin air during a flight are higher than in US and UK homes and similar to levels found in industrial environments.\nDespite the high levels on aircraft, the amount of Deca and other PBDEs in the bodies of airline workers is about the same as the general public. A 2010 study did not find higher average levels of PBDEs in the blood of 30 Dallas-based flight attendants and pilots compared to the U.S. general public, though some individuals did have high levels.\n\"We found no evidence whatsoever of actual intake into the body above background level,\" said Arnold Schecter, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston. He said there could be some instances of elevated levels \"in pilots, flight attendants, other workers inside of airplanes or even people flying in airplanes,however, it seems to us based on our research to be extremely remote.\"\nBut the scientists who conducted the new study aren\u2019t convinced so they are now following up their aircraft study with tests of flight attendants. Results are expected later this year.\n\u201cSeveral flight attendants in [Schecter\u2019s] study did have elevated serum concentrations\u2026The weight of evidence certainly suggests that we need to continue to examine this,\u201d said Joseph Allen, a Harvard School of Public Health research associate and lead author of the study.\nComplicating matters, Deca, the most prevalent flame retardant on airplanes, is very difficult to detect in the body, Stapleton said. The amount that gets into the bloodstream is small, so the chemical can escape detection. Also, Deca is bulky so dust coated with it might not pass through the lungs to the bloodstream. If it does pass into blood, it doesn't stay there long, so unless a person is tested soon after a flight, researchers might miss spikes in concentrations.\nAlthough no one knows if flame retardants or other chemicals play a role, flight attendants are more likely to have cancer and miscarriages than the general public.\nFemale flight attendants have a 29 percent higher risk of all cancers, including more than an 11-times greater risk of melanoma and a 35 percent higher risk of breast cancer than the general public. The longer a flight attendant has been working, the greater the risk of cancer, research suggests.\nThey also have a 62 percent higher risk of miscarriage and stillbirth than the general public, according to 2010 study, which says these risks \"have been poorly studied in a limited number of investigations.\" The Association of Professional Flight Attendants says that their flight attendants are allowed to fly during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe triggers of these health problems are still under investigation, and researchers are studying a number of possible culprits, such as radiation.", "I received my Kindle 2 on Wednesday, February 25. First, this was a brilliant marketing and customer satisfaction tactic on Amazon\u2019s part.

When I exercise on the elliptical machine, I find it easy to read with and enjoy having a variety of items to choose from, instead of having to decide before I exercise and then wish I\u2019d picked something else to read.\nThe navigation buttons are clear and the menu is context sensitive (provides a different set of menu options depending where you are\u2026.inside a book, on the home page, in the Kindle store, etc.). The joystick takes a little getting used to, but is unobtrusive enough that it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s in the way. The 16 scale grey electronic ink is very easy to read and easy on the eyes, which is important to me.\nI am trying out the New York Times subscription and am enjoying it. I have observed that I do not go to my usual web news sites as much during the day or in the evening, except for current updates. Since the Times is delivered in the morning, staying current is the only real issue there. I tried the Seattle Times for a few days, but was unimpressed by their formatting compared to the New York Times.\nI like the sample chapter service available from the Kindle Store. There does seem to be a bit of variability in the amount of sample made available, which sometimes means that, even after reading the sample, I don\u2019t know if the title is one I\u2019d invest in.\nThe battery life seems to be good. A friend of mine who owns a Kindle 1 advised me to keep the wireless turned off when I\u2019m not specifically using it to save on the battery, so I have followed that advice. When I turn it on in the morning is when I sync it to receive updates and the New York Times.\nThe device is too expensive for broad adoption. In fact the price held me off from purchasing one before now. While the selection of content is broad, it is still a very small percentage of what is out there. I have spent some time on the Amazon site going through pages of books I\u2019d like to see on Kindle and clicking the link to send that information to publishers.\nThere are some books, like the Bible, that are much more easily navigated with a physical book in hand than on the Kindle. Navigating periodicals is likewise a nuisance. One can go page by page through the article, use the joystick to go the next or previous article, or click on the \u201cView Sections List\u201d to go to a table of contents. Still, this is a version 2 device and I will expect this capability to improve with more user testing in future versions or software upgrades.\nThe prices of Kindle books should be lowered. While they average about $10, I cannot sell them back to a bookshop, which I regularly do with physical books. There are several books that I have in hard bound and paperback editions that I would like to have on my Kindle, but many of them are even higher priced that the average, some as high as $25 (if they are even available). That is too expensive for bits versus atoms.\nI am enrolled in the Master of Communications in Digital Media program and the University of Washington. One of the next big tests for the Kindle is the availability of the texts for my class for spring quarter and how easily the annotation and highlighting tools work.\nI look forward to my first long trip to test out the general convenience of the device and the concept on the road. Like many, I take a number of books with me when I travel, loathe as I am to run out of the things I wish to read. I may even be able to pack less which would really be nice.\nAmazon has done a great job with the Kindle 2. Keeping the device targeted at reading and away from becoming a net book helps focus on the target audience and their habits. They should keep enhancing the reading experience, expanding the content available and making the entire package more affordable.\nStay tuned for my next review after spring quarter on what studying on the Kindle 2 was like.\nI have had the kindle 1 since August and have taken it around the USA and to Africa. I have thoroughly enjoyed having all my reading material with me and have acquired lots of free books too. I found out the hard way one time that I need to take the charger with me on trips just in case. I flew to Oregon one time and on the way, I could not get it to turn on. I had fully charged it a couple of days before and called Amazon to figure out what was wrong since my Kindle was only a couple of months old. THey told me to charge it for awhile then it would be fine when i turned it on. Unfortunately, that trip, I had not taken the charger since I was only going to be gone overnight\u2026I won\u2019t travel again without the charger. It was a one time learned lesson.\nTerrific post Jeff, and a real service to the community! I\u2019ve been agonizing for months on whether to get a Kindle, especially for travel. I think I may hold off just a bit longer.\nI borrowed my dad\u2019s Kindle (v1) for my business trip last month and ended up not taking it for a couple of reasons.\n1. PDF support was awful. After jumping through hoops to get it converted and delivered, the final version was horrid \u2013 it was a 2-page-up scan of a book chapter, and the Kindle rendered it exactly like that. 2-pages, sideways, without any decent zoom / move functionality. Since a lot of my trip readings were PDFs from COM 546, this was a no-go.\n2. Same complain as Jeff \u2013 $10+ for a book is too much for me. I\u2019m a library fan, myself, but wouldn\u2019t mind paying a couple of books for a book on a trip. For that price, though, I\u2019ll buy the paperback and pack it along.\nThank you for this post since I have been debating on getting one to curve my physical book addiction. I have online bookstore that allows me to sell new and used books.\nOne of the big sells for me is the traveling light ability so that I do not have to carry so many books when I travel abroad or nationally.\nI will check out the features based on your recommendations.\nThanks for the review, Jeff. Per our conversation Friday night, I think the point about DRM (inability to sell books after reading) is a major sticking point. I don\u2019t know if the DRM decision is Amazon\u2019s or the book publisher or the author. Anyone?\nI\u2019m still on the fence and, as I wrote last week, worry about the possibility of \u201cnewspapers\u201d using devices like the Kindle and mobile phones as their sole distribution method because they can charge $ for the content.\nThanks Jeff for bringing the Kindle 2 to show-and-tell in class on Tuesday! The text display is pretty amazing!\nI\u2019m thinking about Kathy\u2019s comment above about newspapers using Kindle. In the Journalism on the Brink forum two weeks ago (http://flipthemedia.com/index.php/2009/03/journalism-on-the-brink-video/), one of the attendees brought up the idea of having libraries assist in the distribution of news. Library are tax-payer funded, already administer aggregate content and can be hyper-local in serving their community (or not!) Libraries have high public trust as well. By keeping their current distribution model (expiration of content, levels of renewal availability), they could maintain the existing level of competition with companies like Amazon. Also, it would help keep news from being held captive.\nKindle should be a great partner with publishers, including magazines and newspapers. It may impact the future of the publishing industry and related industries.\n1. Do the books carry a serial number, or digital signature?\n2. Is it possible to sell your copy of a book to another Kindal owner?\n3. Are your books backed up by Amazon in a similar way that iTunes maintains a download list?\n4. Are books available for download from third parties?\n5. How many formats are supported?\nI would like to see a \u201csecond-hand\u201d digital book store before I buy one of the devices.\nThanks! Before that, I\u2019ve never heard of such tools. I will probably think about getting a kindle. Because I\u2019be been enjoy travelling while reading some nice books, that will make my luggage lighter and my trip more easier.\nI do every single task in my life with my computer but when it comes to \u2018reading\u2019, I mostly prefer old print technology. I am so glad to hear your experience with kindle and already curious for your future posts about it. I, as a consumer, am looking forward to affordable \u2018wireless reading device\u2019 and hoping it will replace the old technology. I love these disruptive innovations!\nI just got the kindle 2 but had been reading books on my iphone for a couple of days before it arrived. I am not very overwhelmed out the gate but I have not actually begun reading on it yet. I am not sure if I got the device because I thought it was worth the investment or if I am just really into gadgets. I have enjoyed reading on my iphone and I love listening to audio books. That is what caught my attention about the kindle 2, audio reading.\nThank you for the great post on Kindle! Though I have yet to see the Kindle up close. Being in Asia it\u2019s was just fundamentally harder for me to get my hands on english books and the Kindle would be a great substitute to buying books with insane shipping rates.", "If you've had your eye on either the Google Pixel 3 or Google Pixel 3 XL then you should without doubt check out these deliciously discounted Google Pixel 3 deals.\nPrices have suddenly dropped dramatically on Google's range of flagship handsets (no doubt because of the recent arrival of rivals such as the Samsung Galaxy S10 and Huawei P30 Pro) and that means both the regular sized and plus sized versions of Google's latest Pixel are more accessible than ever.\nAnd that is great news for tech enthusiasts, as the Pixel 3 handsets are among the very best phones on the market today, with their incredible camera systems, quality hardware, and pure vanilla Android experience making them a pleasure to use.\nHere are the best Google Pixel 3 deals and best Google Pixel 3 XL deals going today.\nA cracking Google Pixel 3 deal here from Mobiles.co.uk to kick off the current crazy price crash, with the 64GB handset available for just \u00a340 up front (by using the code 10OFF).

For all the effort that seems to have gone into Aayush Sharma\u2019s Bollywood debut, the makers of \u201cLoveyatri\u201d overlooked one aspect \u2013 the leading man is called by a name that is a synonym for peeing.\nAnd that\u2019s not the only problem. The film was supposed to be a launchpad to stardom for Salman Khan\u2019s brother-in-law, but he seems to be woefully lacking in talent, namely in the acting department. This is truly a throwback to the 80s when big stars used to \u201claunch\u201d their children and relatives, where the quality of the film was secondary.\nSo, in \u201cLoveyatri\u201d, everything and everyone but Sharma is incidental. He plays Sushrut (but everyone called him Susu because his name is apparently unpronounceable), a slacker who shines only on the dance floor. Much to his harried parent\u2019s disapproval, Sushrut dreams of opening a garba (a traditional dance form) school. But when he falls in love with Michelle (Warina Hussain) an NRI visitor to his city, everything else ceases to matter.\nMichelle\u2019s father plays the spoilsport in the love story, but the film doesn\u2019t even put up a good pretense of having any conflict at its centre. For a film that is about a dancer, neither Sharma\u2019s dancing talent nor the song sequences have any energy. The acting is equally sub-par and both Sharma and Hussain are unable to muster up more than one-and-a-half expression each. Their chemistry is non-existent and you have to wonder how Michelle can fall for Sushrut.\nThe only bright spots are provided by Pratik Gandhi and Sajeel Parakh, who play Sushrut\u2019s friends and get the best lines. Everything else about this film seems dated and out of fashion, especially the morality.\nSushrut thinks it is perfectly fine to shame Michelle for choosing to earn money and work at a fancy bank than come back to her homeland. Her father thinks it is his right to decide his daughter\u2019s course in life without asking her. And oh, Sushrut\u2019s uncle keeps encouraging his nephew to pursue Michelle even though she shows no interest initially.\nThis film truly belonged to the 80s. It\u2019s a shame that Bollywood hasn\u2019t moved on when audiences clearly have.", "Pupils at two schools have been learning about politics and elections.\nTo mark the General Election and learn about democracy, Coten End School held a special themed day. Children in all year groups took part in a range of activities to teach them how Britain\u2019s democratic process works and give them the opportunity to develop their debating skills.\nChildren in Foundation Stage enjoyed exploring their polling station role-play area and learned how to vote using a ballot paper. They tried other methods of voting, too, and discussed which was the fairest and most effective.\nKey Stage 1 children had a teacher swap for the morning and tried formulating and expressing their views about given issues, such as whether children should have to bring in a healthy snack at playtime.

The dress code is dead, having been slowly starved of oxygen by the ubiquity of informality. We are instantly on first-name terms, and no one dresses for dinner. A whole new industry around athleisure has sprung up, selling clothes you can wear all day Saturday, from yoga to dinner.\nHurrah! Right? Actually, I am not so sure. The white tie and starched pinnies of Downton Abbey might have been a bind, but at least everyone knew where they stood. Dress codes have now been ditched for a kind of rampant individualism, in which dressing for any occasion \u2013 work, a party, lunch, the gym \u2013 is a contest with no rules, an every-man-for-himself brawl.\nWe have switched from a simple model of compliance to a likes-based fashion economy. We have ditched a system of dressing that offered security for all in favour of one that offers mobility for the talented and ambitious, but that allows others to fail quite spectacularly. There are no rules, and the struggle is real, man.\nTony Soprano. Ali G. Britney Spears. These are the names I think of when I picture a tracksuit; none of them exactly a front-row regular. A tracksuit undoubtedly has a lot going for it. It is egalitarian, machine washable, comfy. Unfortunately, the above are all dirty words at London fashion week.\nInvites to shows don\u2019t come with a dress code, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t think about what you wear. I have a fashion editor friend who eats lunch standing up, between shows, because too much sitting down can give your trousers baggy knees. But I am wearing a tracksuit to the Emilia Wickstead show, where front row regulars include Alexa Chung, Yasmin Le Bon and Samantha Cameron.\nLast year, American Vogue\u2019s fashion editor Grace Coddington wore pyjamas to the Met Ball, which is probably the second most dressed-up party in the world after the Oscars. Here the greeters are in bowler hats, the gents making the martinis are in white tuxedos \u2013 and I am in pyjamas.\nI get a few double takes, but I also get two compliments over the handbasin in the ladies\u2019 loo, including one from a chic woman in a Le Smoking jacket and Gucci loafers, who tells me she wishes she was wearing my outfit. This makes me swoon: compliments in the ladies\u2019 loo are to my mind worth far more than the hello-you-look-lovely stock in trade upstairs. I am chalking this one up as a hit.\nNext stop of the night is a dinner Marc Jacobs is giving at Park Chinois, a fancy new Chinese restaurant off Berkeley Square. It\u2019s only half a mile away, so I walk, much to the bemusement of most passersby. (Pyjamas might work after dark; they don\u2019t work outdoors.) When I arrive, Beth Ditto is there in a pink wig, and Abbey Clancy is in a jumper and a skirt split to her knickers, so I\u2019m relieved I\u2019m not in a boring party dress. Also, the soft-shell crab and wok-seared lily bulb is completely delicious, and it\u2019s all sharing plates, and guess who\u2019s the only woman at the table with an elasticated waistband? Slam dunk.\nPostscript: buoyed by my Saturday night triumph, I took the pyjamas to Milan, where I wore them to a fashion week cocktail party. Big mistake. Nothing has ever illustrated so clearly how much more conservative Milan is, compared with London. The other guests looked pained by my irritating British \u201ceccentricity\u201d, while the waiters were visibly alarmed. Perhaps the British have a particular fondness for pyjamas, I don\u2019t know. But this is not a look that travels.\nLingerie-looking daywear is one of this season\u2019s major catwalk trends. At the Burberry show, models teamed their spaghetti-strapped ivory silk slip dresses with sandals and nylon rucksacks. At C\u00e9line, a silk nightie with black lace trim was worn on the catwalk with flat shoes, hoop earrings and a handbag big enough for packed lunch and yoga kit. On the cover of last month\u2019s British Vogue, Dakota Johnson wore that same dress with a black coat slipping off one shoulder. However, Johnson\u2019s left breast is clearly visible in that photo, so I\u2019m planning instead to channel former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld, who has the knack of giving off a boudoir vibe while keeping covered up: the edges of a black silk camisole might be visible under a tailored blazer.\nI am wearing a dress by Finery \u2013 ivory lace on black, which somehow feels marginally more doable for 9am than the other way around \u2013 under a coat dress by Cos. Any concerns that I might have had in advance that I would look and feel inappropriately smouldery are banished the moment I get dressed. I don\u2019t feel smouldery at all. I feel slightly absurd. Actually, I feel how Cherie Blair looked that morning when she opened the door in her nightie: unarmoured, like a creature that has lost its shell. I don\u2019t like it one bit.\nWhere the pyjamas felt louche, the nightie just feels witless. Whenever anyone in the office looks at what I\u2019m wearing, I feel the need to explain myself, to apologise. This is the exact opposite of what you want from work clothes, which is soundlessly to project your professional persona. I am very happy to leave the office and get on the tube to meet Victoria Beckham at her shop.\nThe train is half empty, but a man springs up to offer me his seat as soon as I step on, which is a first. When I get to Dover Street, the paparazzi who hang around outside Beckham\u2019s shop don\u2019t blink: in Mayfair, slip-plus-coat-plus-heels apparently passes for daywear. Inside, Beckham is wearing a navy tailored coat over a neatly buttoned-up white shirt, with loose trousers and flat shoes. Now that I\u2019m in a fashion environment, my lingerie look works fine. If you work immersed in fashion imagery all day long, catwalk trends soon look completely normal, so neither Beckham nor any of her team bat an eyelid that I appear to have come for a meeting in my nightie. As always, Beckham\u2019s hair, makeup, nails and general poise exist on a stratosphere of grooming I can never even aspire to: despite the casual clothes, she looks 50 times as glamorous as anyone else in the room. Beckham tells me I look lovely, but while I would love to claim this as a style victory, she is probably just being polite. To be honest, her cool, tomboy-chic look is making me feel chintzy and twee in my lace. It is a pretty strange moment, standing next to Victoria Beckham and feeling like I am the one who is really dressed up. Or should that be really undressed? Frankly, I\u2019m confused.\nOn the day of a Saint Laurent show that was all slip dresses and crazy-lady fur coats, designer Hedi Slimane tweeted a photo of the tiara worn by almost every model in the show. It was captioned: \u201cSaint Laurent grunge tiara to be worn with anything.\u201d And what Hedi says goes, right? Since then, tiaras have become a regular feature on the catwalk. Gigi Hadid wore one in Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s show, which had an otherwise nautical theme. Go figure. Tiaras are the new sunglasses, or something. Which is how I come to be wearing a tiara with a Self-Portrait burgundy lace dress and a fluffy, mint-green Shrimps coat and a pair of Bowie-ish Topshop boots, at the Green Shop grocery store in north London. We have chosen this shop to test wearing a tiara to the shops because the colourful shelves have a pleasingly Juergen Teller/Deutschland 83 vibe for a photo, and because it is near the office. It\u2019s Saturday, and I have a bit more of an audience than I\u2019d bargained for: Arsenal are playing at home today and it\u2019s only half an hour until kick-off at the Emirates, so there is a constant stream of mostly male shoppers stopping by for their lucky pre-match Twix, and since everyone else is in denim and black, accented with red-and-white scarves, I stand out even more than I normally would. What happens is: they notice the fluffy green coat, and then the sparkly boots, and they\u2019re about to make a hilarious comment when they spot the tiara and I can almost see them swallow back the aforementioned lols as they think, \u201cHang on, maybe this is more than a walk of shame. Maybe she\u2019s a bit, you know, not quite right?\u201d And they look away.\nStyling: Melanie Wilkinson. Stylist\u2019s assistant: Billie Brand.

Citing its crippling massive annual national impact \u2014 9,000 deaths and $8 billion in health-care costs \u2014 IBM and Memorial Sloan Kettering set out to find a way to apply automated analytics to better detect the disease.\nLed by IBM researcher Noel Codella, the project builds on the company\u2019s work on machine learning techniques aimed at automatically picking out things like dogs or cats in imagery, or even picking out a dog or a cat in a photo.\nAt the same time, Codella told VentureBeat, Memorial Sloan Kettering has been building a database of dermatological images that show different kinds of skin lesions and other elements of diseases and tie them to specific clinical properties.\n\u201cOur cognitive systems are using this data to learn what types of features and patterns are most frequent in melanoma to help recognize the disease in images,\u201d Codella said in a phone interview.\nCodella added that IBM\u2019s technology has proven adept at analyzing large numbers of images far quicker and with a more finely detailed level of measurement than any doctor could do. The system is designed to evaluate an image in less than a second.\nWhile Codella\u2019s group often works with IBM\u2019s Watson division, Watson \u2014 which famously beat the world\u2019s top Jeopardy players and is now being used to tackle large-scale computing problems in everything from finance to health \u2014 was not involved in the skin cancer project.\nIBM used its technology in controlled tests of more than 3,000 cases of melanoma and other skin lesions. Codella explained that the system was able to identify positive and negative cases of skin cancer with 95-plus percent accuracy.\nThe highest level of accuracy humans have achieved is 84 percent, Codella said, while some automated approaches have hit 90 percent.\nFor now, this technology is still in the research stage, and Codella said it could be some time before it is available to dermatologists everywhere. That means, of course, that it could fail to emerge from IBM\u2019s research labs.

HP is aiming to launch the televisions and music service at January's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, although plans are still in flux, the source said Tuesday.\nHewlett-Packard plans to offer flat-panel televisions and its own digital music service early next year.\nHP's plans represent the latest move by traditional PC makers to push into the consumer electronics market. It also shows the growing interest in music download services, although profit margins are extremely thin and likely to shrink further as competition heats up.\nAs previously reported, HP is eyeing both the digital music and flat-screen TV markets as part of a deeper push into consumer electronics.\n\"Entertainment will be a very big focus for us going forward,\" HP Vice President Chris Morgan said in an interview Monday. \"We think this holiday (season) was about digital photography first and foremost...A year from now I think entertainment is going to be an equally big deal, as is digital photography\" today.\nAs for televisions, Morgan called the move a \"natural extension\" of the company's position as one of the leading sellers of displays.\nThe move into music players is not entirely new. Compaq Computer had a line of digital music players before the merger, though the products were later discontinued. Both HP and Compaq have sold devices that connect digital music libraries to the stereo, including the current Digital Media Receiver product.\nAlthough HP is following companies such as Apple Computer, Gateway and Dell into the market, retail analyst Stephen Baker of NPD Group said that it has some advantages over other computer makers.\n\"The first advantage they have is pretty deep and extensive relationships with the retailers--more than anyone on the IT side,\" Baker said.\nAt the same time, Gateway and Dell have a captive customer once they get someone on the phone, while HP must find ways to distinguish itself against a variety of competitors, he said.\n\"That's probably HP's biggest challenge,\" Baker said. \"They are going to be in an environment where there is a lot of choice. They need to find a way to stick out.\"\nTim Deal, an analyst with Technology Business Research, said that PC makers see the potential for higher margins with MP3 players and other gadgets, but that the companies will have a challenge making devices that are unique.\n\"Right now, the barrier to entry into this market is very low,\" Deal said. \"What is HP's differentiation going to be?...What is going to tie the hardware to the music service? I don't think anything but the (HP) name.\"\nHP also will need to get stores to showcase its entertainment products, or it might find itself lost against better-known names in the new categories it is moving into, Baker said.\n\"It has always proven to be difficult in a retail environment to try and move from one section to another,\" he said.", "After the release of 26 murderers as a gesture of good faith to Abu Mazen\u2019s relatively moderate terrorist organization, I wondered if anyone viewed Israel in a more favorable light. After all, what other nation would negotiate with terrorists in order to achieve a semblance of peace with those same terrorists? Would America release hundreds of terrorists from Guantanamo Bay in an effort to make peace with the Taliban and al Qaeda? Would America do so to improve its image in the Muslim world? The answer is obvious but I think it\u2019s necessary to examine why.\nAmerica would not release hundreds of terrorists in order to appease al Qaeda because it recognizes that al Qaeda will only be ultimately satisfied with the dissipation of Western civilization, the leader of which is the United States. So, to release terrorists would only serve as the first step in its own national suicide. The quid pro quo America would gain for its appeasement would be its eventual self-destruction.\nAmerica would also refrain from releasing terrorists to improve its image in the Muslim world because, from a philosophical perspective, it recognizes that a world which holds murderers in high esteem should itself be compelled to improve its image in the eyes of the Western world, and not the other way around. The onus therefore is upon the Muslim world to improve its relations with Western civilization. A good start would be to introspectively examine its own value system and cease from praising Jihad seekers who cause death and destruction, not demand that those same individuals be released in the name of a quasi- peace.\nIn other words, America realizes that when it comes to its own self-interests, negotiating for peace with those who seek, indeed, live, to see their destruction, is a futile mission. The creed upon which the United States was founded is \u2018liberty and justice for all\u2019, and as such it is their duty to resolutely uphold their good name and the principles upon which they were founded. To do anything else is to give those who question these principles moral legitimacy and a voice on the world stage.\nI have no doubt that Israel\u2019s leaders work according to this same formula. So how does one explain its actions vis-\u00e1-vis the erroneously titled \u2018peace process\u2019? Perhaps Israel believes that in being the \u2018better person\u2019 on the playground that is the Middle East where corrupt bullies are the norm and just democratic leaders are rarities, she will gain the favor of the rest of Western leadership both in America and Europe. And, in being the better person, this will gain favors from stronger Western countries with greater firepower which can be used in perhaps attacking a genocidal regime in a certain Persian country hellbent on starting another world war. I understand the logic, but Im afraid that Israel is horribly mistaken.\nIt is important to recognize that Israel is not being \u2018the better person\u2019 when it capitulates in the hopes of help from stronger countries. Why? Precisely because of the same principle those stronger countries operate upon: the inevitable self-destruction that comes with that capitulation. Israel is instead being the \u2018naive person,\u2019 compelled to refrain from upholding its own national sovereignty by countries who hypocritically insist upon doing so for their own populaces. It is also important to realize that if stronger countries like the United States do not already realize the strategic imperative which exists in prematurely striking Iran, the fact that they must be bribed into doing so by coercing an ally to negotiate with terrorists who are financially backed by Iran speaks volumes.\nHere is an interesting paradox. The United States which operates according to the formula presented above is actually compelling Israel to refrain from operating within those same logical constraints of international diplomacy. The end will be detrimental for both Israel and the US if they bear fruit. We have the same enemies and the same goals. It is not Israel\u2019s responsibility to convince the leaders of Western civilization to uphold its own standards of justice and truth, nor is it Israel\u2019s responsibility to be made to endure a trial and error process of being the \u2018better, naive\u2019 person, which as precedent has shown has only brought death and destruction.\nInstead, Israel\u2019s leaders must understand that by capitulating to the insidious demands of their opponents--whose philosophy in life is unequivocally evil and morally bankrupt-- they give credence to these same despots on the world stage. Capitulation does not paint Israel in a positive light, nor does it help win friends who should already be backing the Jewish state from both an ethical and strategic standpoint. All it does is give greater clout to the illegitimacy foisted upon the Jewish state by dissenting naysayers and anti-Semitic ideologues. \u2018If Abu Mazen says that genocidal brothers in arms of his must be released because this is just and Israel yields, than what he says must be right, and Israel must believe it as well.\u2019 This is unfortunately how the world thinks.\nAfter the release, I perused the various social media sites from Twitter to Facebook and wanted to know what the great journalists, ostensibly representing the sentiment of the American public, had to say about the actions of the Israeli government. Unfortunately, the response was the same: the same incessant false moral equivalencies of \u2018terrorist\u2019 and \u2018freedom fighter,\u2019 the same description of communities where Jews live as a \u201chindrance to peace,\u201d and the same whitewashing of crimes committed by intransigent extremists, described mendaciously as acts of liberation. This is unfortunately not uncanny; this must stop.\nI would be remiss if I did not point out the rock and the hard place between which Israel finds itself, especially in the context of cost-benefit analysis. The USA provides a great deal of resources to Israel, especially militarily which can (and I\u2019m sure is) used to hold Israel at the behest of America\u2019s leadership. Thus Israel has a dilemma it must grapple with. Refrain from doing what America says and potentially lose the support that helps to defend the Jewish state from its enemies. This is a hard position which must be worked out by Israel\u2019s leadership but I believe that ultimately what matters are ideas. Ideas inspire. And the idea which Israel must aspire to, indeed the idea upon which it was founded, is the national sovereignty of its own people and their right to live in their ancient homeland. The price of sacrificing this quintessential Zionist creed is far more costly than risking ties with an ally that, in the grand scheme of things, does not seem at present to desire to help it anyway.\nI realize the gravity of that statement, and, as a proud American, it is hard one to make. But I have examined the actions of American leadership, both the current administration and the past, both democrat and republican, and veracity compels me to admit there is a perplexing pattern of coercing the Jewish state into concessions we would not ourselves be prepared to make. I do not know the reasons for it and I am not now prepared to ask the questions for fear of the answers which I may be forced to grapple with for the rest of my life. The implications of such a pattern are too much for me to bear right now. I do know, however, the creeds upon which our two countries were founded, and that if my country does not uphold her own, for the love of humanity and the survival of Western civilization, Israel must uphold hers.\nI hope that Israel\u2019s leaders will not let this moment pass by. It is precisely in this moment of western hypocrisy, growing European anti-Semitism, and seemingly insurmountable pressure from a boisterous sea of despicable despots, that the Jewish state must find within herself the deep unwavering conviction in her ideals and the courage to declare that it by right exists and, as it is her duty, will defend the name of justice and virtue. This declaration may indeed be the noise that wakes up the greater part of Western civilization which has now fallen asleep.", "(ALOHA, Ore.) -\t Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue is saddened to report that a woman rescued from a burning home in Aloha Saturday morning has passed away.\nBrenda Ann Mocaer was 47 years old and lived in the home. \"Our hearts and thoughts go out to Ms. Mocaer's family,\" says TVF&R Public Information Officer Brian Barker, \"our firefighters got to the home within minutes, quickly searched for and located her and rushed her to an ambulance.

Her debut, \u201cFrench Milk,\u201d came out in 2008 when she was 23, and she has been prolifically productive ever since; her second book, the food memoir, \u201cRelish,\u201d became a New York Times best-seller, and several other charming, autobiographical image-and-text books followed in swift succession.\nKnisley answered the following questions by email, just as her book tour was kicking off. The transcript has been edited for length and clarity.\nQ: You describe yourself as someone who spent a \u201clifetime of yearning\u201d to become a mother. Why has that always been a desire of yours, and why \u2014 when faced with the extreme difficulty and danger of conceiving and bearing a child chronicled in your memoir \u2014 was it so important to you to have a baby who was biologically yours rather than adopting or perhaps living a childless life?\nA: Mostly I wasn\u2019t aware of the hardships I\u2019d go through when trying to get pregnant and giving birth. My mom had an easy pregnancy with me, and I was young and healthy and didn\u2019t anticipate any problems. My doctors were all sanguine about the whole thing, and up until things went really bad at the end, I didn\u2019t ever think my life would be in danger. That said, I have always been fascinated with my body\u2019s capacity to build a human being. Pregnancy is fascinating and cool, and I wanted to do it, even just once (which is probably enough, considering).\nQ: Did you know all along you were going to make a memoir about pregnancy? You write about \u201c \u2018Exorcist\u2019 levels of puke,\u201d \u201chormonal insomnia and nightmares,\u201d and losing \u201cabout half the blood\u201d in your body during labor. How did you decide to be so candid? What did it take not to shy away from the gross and terrifying parts?\nA: I always thought it would make an interesting graphic novel, to write about pregnancy. It\u2019s a visual change and a transitional state, which I\u2019ve covered in a lot of my other books. I thought it would be a pretty typical story, though. Turns out, I was right, but I hadn\u2019t known how typical it was to have so much heartache, pain and vomit, as well as a near-death experience! My eyes were opened to a lot of the things surrounding human reproduction that I had no previous concept of, and that became a much more complicated book than I\u2019d expected.\nQ: At what stage in the process did the children\u2019s book come along? What were its challenges and do you have plans to write more?\nA: I\u2019ve wanted to do a picture book for a long time and even have some experience illustrating books by other authors, but as someone who still worships picture books, I was always very intimidated by it. How to even begin to make something worthy of sharing a shelf with \u201cThe Snowy Day\u201d by Ezra Jack Keats or \u201cOoh-La-La (Max in Love)\u201d by Maira Kalman? Comics I know, but kids books were a new arena. Then, as so often happens, I had an idea of a story I wanted to read my kid, and it all came together from there. But it was weirdly a lot harder than writing a 300-page graphic novel! I hope I get faster eventually.\nQ: You\u2019re adept at adapting your own lived experiences into memoir-comics; might you ever develop a fiction project?\nA: I\u2019m currently working on a fictional middle-grade graphic novel about step-sisters, based on my own experiences. I\u2019m getting closer and closer to full fiction!\nQ: You\u2019ve said that you grew up reading comics despite your \u201cartistic and literary parents\u2019 mild objections.\u201d Why does the comics form appeal to you as a reader and a creator? What do you hope your son will grow up reading and why?\nA: I actually think my parents were responsible, if inadvertently so, for my career. My dad is a literature and writing professor, and my mom is an artist and chef. I loved reading comics as a kid, but I wanted to be a midwife for most of my childhood. When I got older, I thought I\u2019d have to choose between being a writer or a visual artist. I found a way to combine them through comics, and it\u2019s allowed me to be both.\nQ: How did your higher education \u2014 especially here in Chicago \u2014 impact your work, and what advice do you have for younger artists starting out?\nA: I went to the School of the Art Institute to be a painter, but in my freshman year, changed my mind and wanted to make comics. At the time, there wasn\u2019t a program for it, so I had to find understanding drawing and writing professors who would allow me to experiment with making comics. I also had to compromise and learn traditional techniques in both mediums, which I think made me a better comic artist and writer in the long-term. So my advice would be to allow yourself to learn things outside of the obvious in what you want to do, because it will all serve to make you a stronger, more versatile creator.\nQ: Would you describe yourself as optimistic, pessimistic or something else when it comes to the kind of future \u2014 political, climatological \u2014 that babies born in the early 21st century will face?\nA: I have a pin that I bought a while ago that says \u201cCheerful Despair\u201d (it\u2019s from The School of Life) and I love it. I think it sums up so much of being a parent and an artist and a human being. There\u2019s this constant awareness of life\u2019s fragility and the awfulness we all face, and how loving someone or something is dangerous and scary, but that we can contain that despair while being cheerful at the same time\u2014 enjoying what we can and the pleasures in life and love and art.\nQ: Any tips for soon-to-be or new parents, especially ones who live in your city of Chicago?\nA: The Garfield Park Conservatory is open 365 days a year. It saved our lives in the first winter of parenthood. Go and be in a place surrounded by green plants and watch your baby look at them for the first time. Breathe in the moist air and take a funny photo of your baby next to a leaf bigger than they are.", "Researchers study middle-school children playing so-called exergames and find that energy expenditure during the games can be moderate or even vigorous in intensity.\nThose who prefer the comfort and proximity of their own living rooms to the gym have good news today: so-called exergames can indeed result in elevated energy expenditures, often above that achieved walking 3 miles an hour on a treadmill.\nBruce W. Bailey, a researcher at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and Kyle McInnis of the University of Massachusetts in Boston studied the effects of six forms of exergaming--interactive \"gaming activities that feature player movement\"--on 39 middle school boys and girls. They assessed energy expenditure throughout 10 minutes of play followed by 5 minutes of rest.\nThe results: walking at 3 miles per hour resulted in an average metabolic equivalent task value of 4.9; Wii boxing came in at 4.2; Dance Dance Revolution at 5.4; Cybex Trazer Goalie Wars at 5.9; LightSpace Bug Invasion at 6.4; Xavix J-Mat at 7.0; and Sportwall at 7.1.\nThe only difference between \"normal\" children (those with a body mass index at less than the 85th percentile) and \"at-risk\" children (BMI 85th percentile and up) was that those considered at-risk reported the highest levels of enjoyment while playing the games. The researchers also specified that all six exergaming intensity levels are consistent with current physical activity recommendations for children.\n\"Although exergaming is most likely not the solution to the epidemic of reduced physical activity in children, it appears to be a potentially innovative strategy that can be used to reduce sedentary time, increase adherence to exercise programs, and promote enjoyment of physical activity,\" the authors said in their report that went live online today. Their report will appear in the July print issue of the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine.\nThis is just the beginning of the group's research interests. Other areas of interest include monitoring total physical activity and energy expenditure over weeks and months and comparing exergames to other forms of exercise and sport.", "Bridgnorth, Shifnal and Oswestry head into the final day of the Birmingham League season in a three-way battle for promotion from Division One.\nVictory over Shifnal last weekend would have seen Bridgnorth promoted to the Premier Division for the first time in the club\u2019s history.\nBad weather got in the way that day, but they head to Brockhampton as clear favourites to finish second behind Kidderminster.\nSam Whitney\u2019s side sit 12 points clear of Shifnal and 16 ahead of Oswestry.\nBut Whitney is wary of going to a team who need a win to stay above rock bottom Wellington and avoid the drop.\n\u201cI\u2019d much rather be playing a team in the middle of the table with nothing to gain,\u201d admitted Whitney. \u201cThey know if they win and finish second bottom they\u2019ve got a good chance of staying up with C&R Hawks not able to be promoted.\n\u201cWhen Daryl Mitchell plays for them they are a different team, a bit like when Charlie Morris plays for us.\nSimon Gregory and Tom Weaver are also missing through work commitments, meaning call-ups from the seconds for Mark McPherson-Lees, Matt Martin and Ben Lees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate to be without three players considering the enormity of the game,\u201d added Whitney.\n\u201cBut the seconds haven\u2019t lost a game this season so the players coming in are full of confidence and have the winning habit.\n\u201cMark has been in and out of the side this season but he\u2019s someone I can always rely on.

We have a home game and they have a potential banana skin at Brockhampton.\n\u201cThere\u2019s all to play for. We just have to win our game and then we will see what happens.\n\u201cIt was frustrating last week because I think we were on top when we came off.\n\u201cI think we\u2019d have won the game had it gone the distance.\nShifnal remain without the injured Jack Edwards but are boosted by the return of Ed Beard and Mitchell Stanley, who come in for Calvin Priest and Ismail Anwar.\nOswestry go to Leamington needing a victory and heavy defeats for both Bridgnorth and Shifnal if they are to steal second spot.\nAt the other end of the table, Wellington are at Tamworth needing to pick up three more points than Brockhampton to avoid finishing bottom.\nIf they could do that, and C&R Hawks finished second in Division Two, then Wellington would avoid relegation.\nShrewsbury are almost certain to finish their Premier Division campaign in fifth and they end their season with a trip to fourth-placed Smethwick.\nNewport and Whitchurch will aim to go out of the Birmingham League on a high before they return to the Shropshire League in 2019.\nWhitchurch complete their Division Three programme away to Handsworth while Newport welcome table-toppers Rugby to Audley Avenue.", "One day after announcing his plans to not seek re-election in 2018, U.S. Sen.

Death Valley in California is one example.\nAnd the images from the Dawn mission show that Vesta's troughs have many of the qualities of graben, such as floors that are flat or curved and have distinct walls on either side, like the letter U.\nVesta now appears to be unusually planet-like, in that its mantle is ductile and can stretch under a lot of pressure. \"It can become almost silly putty-ish,\" said Buczkowski. \"You pull it and it deforms.\"", "The Weinstein Company is in the early stages of turning a biography of Judy Garland into a play, a musical, or a film, with the actress Anne Hathaway to play Garland, the company announced on Monday night. The project was first reported by The Associated Press.\nThe company acquired the film and stage rights last year to Gerald Clarke\u2019s biography, \u201cGet Happy: The Life of Judy Garland,\u201d which was published in 2000 by Random House.\nEmily Feingold, a spokeswoman for the company, said on Tuesday that the Garland project was \u201cin a very, very early phase right now,\u201d and that executives had only just begun reaching out to writers and directors to help them decide whether to develop the work as a stage musical, a play with music, a film, or in more than one version.\nAccording to a news release from the company, \u201cGet Happy\u201d is based in part on Garland\u2019s unfinished and unpublished autobiography, as well as hundreds of interviews conducted by Mr. Clarke.\nMs. Hathaway, who was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress for her role in last year\u2019s \u201cRachel Getting Married,\u201d made an impression during the Oscars telecast in February when she demonstrated a strong singing voice during a number with the Oscars host, Hugh Jackman. Her involvement in the Garland project predates that performance.\nWow- pretty big shoes to fill!\nBig shoes to fill, but I think she\u2019ll be great. Hathaway is very talented.\nI saw Anne Hathaway in a semi-staged version of \u201cCarnival\u201d staged at City Center for its Encore series several years ago.\nShe was just a kid then; she had a nice little voice, not the big belter of Judy Garland at the same age.\nI liked her performance acting -wise. She made Lilli a very sympathetic character: earnest and eager rather than the usual awkward and foolish. She held her own next to Brian Stokes Mitchell, whixh is saying a lot.\nPerhaps with maturity and more vocal training she could give it a try.\nI wish her luck: She dumps scandalized boyfriend, receives an Oscar nomination, stays off tabloid front pages.\nAnne has a silly little quiet musical voice compared to the grand Miss Garland\u2019s. They really ought to have her lip synch the songs, or the movie will become a laughable Lifetime TV movie. What a pox that would be.\nOn a separate note, Milburn and I had Anne over for dinner right after she broke up with that loathsome boyfriend, she was in a marvelous lather over his problems with the law. Anne gave me a lovely asparagus picker- upper, and in sterling silver. How did she know the cook was actually making asparasus?

That will likely have to wait until year's end - perhaps as a \"one more thing\" at the iPhone 5 launch? - according to one analyst.\nPeter Misek, an equity analyst with Jefferies, was in Asia recently and said he saw \"evidence [that] commericial iTV production is starting.\"\n\"We believe specialty components have begun to ship to Apple's Asia panel suppliers with polarized films, filters, and IGZO components starting to move in small quantities,\" Misek wrote in a Monday note to investors.\nMisek speculated that the Apple TV set would go into production in May or June with 2-5 million devices and officially hit the market during the fourth quarter.\nMisek refers to the Apple TV set as the \"iTV\" in his notes, but doesn't explicity say that's what Apple will call its device. Last month, there were reports that British TV network ITV had asked Apple not to use that name, but ITV denied that it had been in touch with Apple on the subject recently.\nRumors about an Apple-based television set have been making the rounds since last year after Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography mentioned that the late Apple co-founder was working on an Apple-branded TV before his death on Oct. 5. Apple, however, has made no announcements.\nMisek, meanwhile, also touched on the iPhone and the new iPad.\nHe said concerns about backlogs for the new iPad are \"overblown,\" arguing that \"there will be enough screens for the new iPads.\"\nBuilding 12-15 million iPads in the first quarter seems \"reasonable,\" Misek continued. \"Our checks indicate that Apple is attempting to boost builds for [the second quarter] from 15M-18M to 18M-20M.\"\nA Piper Jaffray analyst recently estimated that Apple could sell more than 1 million iPads on launch day, March 16.\nJefferies also raised its estimates for iPhones sold this year from 145 million to 155 million after manufacturers Hon Hai and Pegatron upped their own output estimates, due in part to the arrival of the iPhone on China Telecom.\nMisek said he still expects the next-gen iPhone to make its debut in the third quarter with a 4- or 4.3-inch screen, wider form factor, A6 processor, and \"refreshed design.\" Until then, \"iPhone 4S sales are particularly strong and have shown lower than normal seasonality,\" he wrote.\nFor more, see PCMag's hands on with the new iPad and the slideshow below.

He was cursed for blacking out football games, praised for his charity work, slammed for building a new stadium near a black middle-class neighborhood and hailed as a hero when his team won two Super Bowls.\n\"He had a fire that warmed many and burned a few,\" said comedian Danny Thomas of his former Dolphins partner and longtime friend.\n\"He was a go-getter from the start,\" recalled boyhood friend Howard Wolf. \"He was always a competitor -- not in athletics as much as in tests of intelligence. He was marked as different from the other kids in that way. He had tenacity. It is a difference that I guess has carried through his whole life.\"\nThat tenacity came from Robbie's parents. His mother was first-generation Irish and a celebrated baker whose angel food cakes still make mouths water in tiny Sisseton, S.D., where Robbie, the second of five children, was reared. His father was a Lebanese immigrant who operated a restaurant, pool hall and boarding house before becoming the town's police chief.\nRobbie later called his Irish-Lebanese heritage \"double jeopardy,\" explaining: \"The only thing that keeps me in balance is knowing that I have an ancestry among two of the most volatile people on the face of this earth.\"\nShort and slightly built as a boy, Robbie roamed Sisseton in patched clothes, developing the silver tongue that would win him state and national debating contests and provide the road out of the tiny farming community near the Minnesota state line.\n\"He was tenacious when it came to debating or arguing,\" Wolf said. \"He could hold more than his own. It didn't matter what side he was on.\"\nIn 1934, Robbie dropped out of high school to help his family. He cut trees in the Black Hills with Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps for $30, sending $25 of it home each month. A year later, he returned to high school and in 1935 was one of the two from his class of '46 to go on to college.\nArmed with a debating scholarship, he hitchhiked the 85 miles from his home to Northern State Teachers College in Aberdeen, S.D., with plans of becoming a journalist. Politics and the law soon lured him in another direction, and, after serving as Northern State's student body president, he transferred to the University of South Dakota.\nRobbie was a senior when he met the woman he would marry in the university library. Elizabeth was a freshmen and working her way through school for a history degree when Robbie tried to check out a book. She discovered that he owed $4.35 in fines and had been barred from borrowing any other books until the fee was paid -- a charge that an impoverished boy in Depression-era South Dakota could not meet.\nThey talked, and he walked her home. Two years later, they married. Over the next 20 years, the couple had 11 children. Nine survive.\nThe day after the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, Robbie joined the Navy. Assigned duty aboard landing craft in the Pacific, he participated in five invasions, rose through the ranks to officer and earned a Bronze Star before his discharge.\nAt war's end, Robbie entered the University of South Dakota's law school under the G.I. Bill, was elected student body president and graduated in 1946. He opened a law office in Mitchell, S.D., and began dabbling in politics and forming ties with other rising stars in the region.\nIn 1948, at the age of 33, he entered politics as a liberal Democrat. He was elected to South Dakota's house. He was minority leader and the state's Democratic chairman before launching an unsuccessful bid for governor in 1950.\nA year later, Hubert H. Humphrey encouraged Robbie to move his family to Minneapolis. The invitation was quickly accepted and brought the two men closer together. Robbie later provided Humphrey with financial support and worked tirelessly in his campaigns.\nAfter setting up his own law firm, Robbie worked as regional director of the Office of Price Stabilization for four states in 1952-53.\nHis infatuation with football rekindled in Minneapolis with a $5 seat at Vikings games, and when a client began looking around in the mid-60s for a city for an American Football League expansion team, Robbie took the ball and literally ran with it.\nAt meeting in Washington in March 1965, University of South Dakota classmate and Navy buddy Joe Foss, then the commissioner of the AFL, urged Robbie to look at Miami, not Philadelphia, as the site for an expansion team.\nWith Humphrey's endorsement in hand, Robbie flew to Miami and received the blessing of the late mayor, Robert King High. There were financial hurdles, political roadblocks, numerous bruised egos before Robbie, with the financial support of comedian Danny Thomas and other members of a limited partnership, raised the $7.5 million Dolphins franchise fee and the team took the field.\nThere followed a series of other partnerships before the Robbie family took control, finally solidifying the team's future earlier this year by creating a living trust that will give the Robbie family control of the franchise for at least the next generation.\nThe same year that Robbie mortgaged his Minneapolis home, moved to Miami, took the title of general managing partner and began pushing his coaches and players into the Super Bowl also put him on the road to riches.\nThe football franchise he initially invested $100,000 in is now valued at more than $125 million, according to one expert. The Joe Robbie Stadium he built and opened in 1987 is worth another $115 million. While most of his personal wealth was on paper, Robbie owned a home in Miami Shores, several condominium apartments in the Miami area and a 4,00-acre ranch fronting a river in Montana.\nThere was tragedy mixed with his success.\nA daughter, Kathleen, 22, drowned in Acapulco, Mexico, in September 1971, and four years later, a son, Dr. David Lyle Robbie, 31, plunged to his death from San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. He separated from his wife once and twice was arrested on drunken driving charges. He beat both counts but family and friends insisted that he always be driven by a chauffeur.\n\"I think there is some misunderstanding of who I am and what I am,\" Robbie once said. \"I recognized what the public perception of me is.\n\"But I don't think I'm a harsh man. When you are driving to get a job done, everybody doesn't stand around patting each other on the back. You have to drive forward. You don't accomplish things without stirring feathers or causing friction. I ruffle feathers because I'm competitive. But that is something that's been rooted in me all my life. It's part of my heritage.\"\nFuneral services are private.

It might not even have been the best Hazard goal of this campaign, bearing in mind another solo belter against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup in September, this time cutting in from the right, nutmegging Alberto Moreno and holding off Naby Ke\u00efta to drive a fierce shot past Simon Mignolet from an unpromising angle.\nThe possibility also exists that Hazard\u2019s opener against West Ham was not necessarily the most stunning goal of the weekend. There were a couple of goals from the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley that were surely worthy of consideration.\nExhibit A would be the remarkable piece of improvisation from Gerard Deulofeu that transformed Watford\u2019s afternoon against Wolves. Again, few other players would even have conceived of such an audacious ploy, let alone had the confidence to attempt it and then the skill to implement it to perfection. You don\u2019t see too many goals like that, but Deulofeu has always been willing to try something different and it was gratifying to see him get a reward.\nNot only was it a trademark Deulofeu moment, it was in a real sense a match-winning goal. Watford were going nowhere before he scored it, the commentators were remarking that for nearly 80 minutes they had been unable to lay a glove on Wolves, but from the moment Deulofeu landed his blow there was only one team in it.\nIndividual brilliance such as that will always be celebrated, and quite rightly, though one of the problems with the entire notion of a goal of the season is the parameters set for evaluation. Is it right that individual or solo virtuosity usually attracts most attention, in the same way that attacking players usually crowd out defenders when it comes to player of the year awards?\nIt might just be because there is so much football on TV, but are we seeing more exquisite goals than ever?\nWhat about the concept of a team goal, where several players might be involved, each using movement and anticipation to create a scoring chance that the opposition can do little to prevent?\nThe goal that took Manchester City to the FA Cup final against Brighton was a great example of that. It might have come too early in the game to permit any drama in the 86 minutes that followed, it might not have featured a mazy dribble or an unstoppable shot, but as an example of members of a team working together like parts of a well-oiled machine it was hard to beat.\nFirst there was Aymeric Laporte\u2019s immaculate pass from midfield out to Bernardo Silva on the right. Brighton would probably cut it out given another chance but first time round they were not expecting such an adventurous and accurate pass from a central defender. Crucially, Silva did not attempt to control the ball, but laid it back first time to Kevin De Bruyne, who was already in position for the sort of cross he delivers so well.\nThe ball was duly whipped in to the area of uncertainty between the Brighton back-line and their goalkeeper, and though it bounced to make the cross even more difficult to deal with, Gabriel Jesus had the alertness and flexibility to reposition himself for a header at the far post.\nSome reports said the ball sat up nicely for him, which it certainly did not. It skidded through quickly and the way Jesus adapted was impressive, though his was simply the fourth piece of skill in an almost perfect team goal. Martin Keown, analysing for the BBC, was almost affronted by City\u2019s lethal efficiency. The defenders never had a chance, was the gist of his comments. The goal, he thought, might simply have been undefendable.\nThree different goals from the same weekend, three different contenders for excellence for varying reasons. It might just be because there is so much football on television nowadays, or because pitches are in pristine condition right through the year, but can it be the case that we are seeing more exquisite goals than we ever used to?\nThe well-documented difficulties the BBC had with its goal of the month/season competition notwithstanding, it has become almost impossible in the last few years to keep track of all the exceptional scoring efforts over the course of a campaign. Goals from direct free-kicks, for example, practically warrant a category of their own. Every time something astounding is achieved it seems to be surpassed within a few weeks.\nThe expression \u201cspoilt for choice\u201d came to mind when viewing a compilation of the best Premier League goals scored in August last year, and that was just the first month of the season. Clearly Hazard will be a loss to English football if he does move to Spain, though just as evidently he is not the only genius at work in this country. In terms of glorious goals we have quite possibly never had it so good.", "Labour risked a fresh split on immigration as shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer insisted that changes to European Union free movement rules must form part of the negotiations for quitting the bloc.\nSir Keir acknowledged that scrapping the cherished EU principle of free movement of labour would make it harder to maintain tariff-free access to the prized single market.\nBut he said the issue could not be ignored if the bitter divides caused by the EU referendum campaign are to be healed.\nPromising a \u201cbold and ambitious\u201d response, Sir Keir said the rules must change.\n\u201cThe status quo is not an option,\u201d he said. \u201cLabour recognises that without the hard work and skill of migrants our public services, our businesses and our economy would suffer. But we have also always been the party that values strong, cohesive communities.\n\u201cIt was striking that the referendum results showed the areas in the country with the highest levels of immigration voted most strongly to Remain. But the areas with the highest pace of change voted most strongly to Leave.\nBut he acknowledged that demanding reforms to free movement rules would make securing single market access harder because the EU regards them as indivisible.\n\u201cThis is not to pretend that arguing for changes to freedom of movement will not make a deal on single market access harder. It will.\nHis comments came just days after shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, who speaks for Labour on immigration, said the UK could not \u201cdump\u201d free movement and stay in the single market.\nIf the Government loses its Supreme Court challenge and Prime Minister Theresa May is forced to get the backing of MPs to trigger Article 50, Sir Keir said Labour would seek to amend the legislation to prevent a \u201chard Brexit\u201d.\nThat would mean ensuring \u201ccontinued tariff-free access\u201d to the EU and avoiding extra bureaucratic burdens.\nHe insisted that there was no consensus among MPs for a hard Brexit and said Labour had already started consulting parliamentary experts about potential amendments.\nBut he denied that attempting to change the legislation would delay the Brexit process and prevent the Prime Minister from meeting her timetable of triggering Article 50 by the end of March 2017.", "Charlie Trotter, whose eponymous Chicago restaurant was considered one of the finest in the world, has died.\nThe 54-year-old chef was found unconscious and not breathing in his Lincoln Park home this morning and was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nTrotter was found by his son Dylan at the home in the 1800 block of North Dayton Street and an ambulance was called at 10:45 a.m., according to a family friend and fire officials.\n\"My baby's gone,\" Trotter's wife Rochelle told the friend, Carrie Nahabedian.\nIn a statement released Tuesday night, Rochelle Trotter said: \u201cWe are incredibly shocked and deeply saddened by the unexpected loss of Charlie at our home in Lincoln Park. He was much loved, and words can not describe how much he will be missed.\n\"Charlie was a trailblazer and introduced people to a new way of dining when he opened Charlie Trotter\u2019s.

Trotter\u2019s wife and son then left.\nTrotter was pronounced dead at 11:48 a.m. at Northwestern. An autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday, but a source said there was no preliminary indications of foul play.\nTrotter burst on the scene in 1987, when the self-taught chef opened Charlie Trotter\u2019s restaurant on Armitage Avenue. In short order, the chef\u2019s intense creativity and never-repeat-a-dish dictum made Trotter\u2019s the most talked-about restaurant in Chicago, and his fame quickly spread throughout the country and beyond.\nThe mercurial chef was a stern taskmaster who demanded the absolute best from everyone who worked for him. He was also a man of uncommon generosity, creating the Charlie Trotter Education Foundation to provide scholarships for culinary students. He received the James Beard Foundation\u2019s Humanitarian of the Year award in 2012.\nMaster Sommelier Larry Stone who served as Trotter's Sommelier in the late 80s and early 90s returned to work with him last year to close up his restaurant.\n\"He was a great inspiration in my life and a fantastic partner,\" said Stone.\nStone, who is now with the Quintessa Winery in Napa Valley, said Trotter and his family were aware that Trotter had a brain aneurysm and Trotter told Stone that he was resigned to it.\n\"It was a time bomb and he felt that he didn't have a lot of time left. It was inoperable and it was not something that could be repaired, it was deep inside the brain,\" Stone said.\nAs a result of his medical condition he was told by doctors that he should not be flying, should not be in high altitudes and should not exert himself because of the pressure on his brain. A friend of the family said he spoke at the Jackson Hole Culinary Conference Sunday night.\n\"I think that's why he had to give up the restaurant ultimately, he realized he had to change a few things in his life,\" said Stone. \"He loved the craft so much he didn't want to give it up, it was so very hard for him to give up.\"\nStone believes that he may have been misunderstood because Trotter was not the type of person to ask for sympathy. He said a number of years ago he went to the Mayo Clinic after he was first having dizzy spells and had collapsed.\n\"It was obvious he had problems and he had some seizures,\" Stone said. \"It's a condition that had worsened in the last few years but it was something he had for quite a while.\"\nStone said Trotter didn't let his health get into his way.\n\"He said, 'When your time comes, it comes.' He didn't dwell on it. I don't think it made him very happy to know that he had a condition that would incapacitate him in some way,\" said Stone. \"He realized there was not much you could do...He never wanted anything to interfere with his craft. He was driven by his love of what he did and a desire to be better and better at it. That's what drove him from the very beginning.\"\nThe news shocked many in the restaurant world, including L.A. chef David LeFevre, owner at MB Post and Fishing With Dynamite in Manhattan Beach, who worked for Trotter for 10 years, dating back to his externship from the Culinary Institute of America.\n\"He\u2019s probably the most important guy in my career,\" LeFevre told the Los Angeles Times while waiting to board a flight from Chicago to Los Angeles after a brief vacation. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I\u2019ve been talking a lot about Charlie this weekend because I was back in Chicago and seeing friends from that period.\n\"I think I can attribute the majority of my attention to detail and the majority of my awareness of what it takes to run a fine dining restaurant to him. He had a very acute sense of attention to detail and he saw things that most people didn\u2019t see. All of us who worked for him are better chefs because we came out of that kitchen.\n\"He may not have been the best people person sometimes when he was trying to achieve a very difficult goal, but there\u2019s no arguing that he made us all better chefs.\n\"I\u2019ve spoken with 10 or 12 people this morning who worked with him and every one is very sad about this. Those of us who got to spend a lot of time with him knew a very caring side of him that not everyone could see.\"\nSari Zernich Worsham, who worked closely with Trotter for 13 years in his kitchen and on his books and PBS series, said she and other Trotter alumni are organizing a candlelight vigil in front of the restaurant buildings at 4:30 p.m. for anyone who would like to come.\n\u201cI just feel like we should do something immediately,\u201d said Worsham, now executive director of chef Art Smith's company.\n\"Charlie always called me his little sister, and I feel like I just lost my big brother,\" she said. \"I\u2019m just speechless. He\u2019s welded and sculpted so many people\u2019s lives and sent them on the path to success. I can\u2019t thank him enough.\"\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can write a sadder story,\" said Yusho chef Matthias Merges, a 14-year veteran of Trotter's kitchen as chef de cuisine, executive chef and director of operations. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even possible.\"\nMerges emphasized that Trotter should be remembered for his incredible influence and success. \"What he\u2019s accomplished has been the game changer for the landscape of American cuisine, and we can never discount that no matter what happens,\u201d Merges said.\nA neighbor, Bunny Snyder, who lives across the street, remembered Trotter fondly, saying he was known as \u201cChef\u2019\u2019 to those in the close-knit neighborhood.\n\u201cHe was terrific on the street,\u2019\u2019 Snyder said, adding that he would usually attend their summer block party and she would often see him walking a dog.\n\u201cHe used to partake in our street fair every year and put out a table,\u2019\u2019 Snyder said. \u201cHe was a good neighbor.\"\nLauren Marks, who has lived on the street for some 30 years, said that she used to see Trotter fairly regularly when he would walk his dogs, but said he had been \"rather reclusive lately.\"\n\"It's a sad thing, it's shocking,\" said Marks, who said she saw the emergency vehicles gathered outside this morning and knew something was wrong. \"With Charlie you never knew what was going to happen on any given day... He was an interesting man.\"\nTom Aries, another neighbor whose child went to school with Trotter's son, called the news \"astonishing.\"\n\"He was a phenomenal chef,\" said Aries, who said that he got to be chef for a day in Trotter's restaurant, and that he ran a very efficient operation.\nAnother woman who walked by Trotter's home said that she used to work for Trotter at his restaurant \u2014 where she had also met her husband.\n\"Charlie was a very sweet man to me all my years working there and treated me like a daughter,\" said the woman, wiping tears from her eyes. She declined to give her name because of the controversy that has surrounded Trotter's interactions with previous employees.\nTrotter, who grew up in Chicago\u2019s north suburbs, was a political science major at the University of Wisconsin at Madison before switching tracks and beginning his culinary training at Sinclair\u2019s in Lake Forest.\nDays before he turned 28, Trotter opened his own restaurant in a two-story North Side townhouse he spent about a year restoring.\n\"I worked in various kitchens from two days to five months,\" Trotter told the Tribune in 1987, just after the restaurant opened. \"I would leave when I wasn't learning anything. I gradually began to conceive of the sort of place I would like to have and the style of cooking I felt comfortable with.\"\nAs a young chef learning his trade and bouncing from kitchen to kitchen, he earned the respect of his mentors.\n\"He's a marathon man,\" said Norman Van Aken, who in 1987 was a chef on Key West. \"He's been with me in three different restaurants and in every one his spirit and persistence has lifted morale. I've never seen such drive, single-minded vision and generosity.\"\nTrotter\u2019s restaurant, greeted by positive reviews, continued growing in stature. In 1997, just a decade after opening, a Tribune critic called the restaurant \u201cone of the city\u2019s treasures\u201d and said Trotter was \u201cas experimental as they come\u201d in the kitchen.\nAs his eatery flourished, Trotter became a regular at civic functions and charity dinners. At one point, his restaurant was purchasing produce from a garden tended by youth in the troubled Cabrini-Green housing projects.\nBut as diners rung in the New Year in 2012, Trotter announced that he\u2019d be shuttering his restaurant months later. The restaurant closed late that summer, just after its 25th anniversary.\nTrotter remained in the news after that final meal, but often not for the best reasons. The chef abruptly ended an auction of his restaurant\u2019s wares when only about a third of the items had been sold.\nThen this summer, he was sued for allegedly selling two wine collectors a bogus bottle for thousands of dollars, which he denied.\nIn August, almost a year to the day after the restaurant closed, Trotter kicked out high school students who had been invited to showcase their artwork from an after-school program in the former restaurant. One student said Trotter \"went ballistic\" when their instructor declined the chef\u2019s request that they sweep floors and clean toilets.\nTrotter was the keynote speaker Sunday at the Jackson Hole Culinary Conference, which was hosted by Central Wyoming College at Jackson.\nSusan Thulin, the director of the college, said Trotter arrived Sunday and left early Monday morning. The subject of his speech was excellence, and he spoke about \u201cempowering your employees, being passionate about what you\u2019re doing \u2026 and working so hard they have to hire two people to replace you,\u201d she said.\nWhile this was the first Jackson Hole Culinary Conference, Thulin said Trotter had been to the area several times before to ski with his son and hoped to return this winter with him. \u201cWe\u2019re so sad to hear of his passing away,\u201d Thulin said. \u201cHe really touched those that were there\u201d to hear his speech.\nThulin also said that Trotter talked about how proud he was of his wife, who was running in the New York City marathon the same day.\nRichard Ofstein, a former chicagoan, who attended the Jackson Hole conference where Trotter was the key note speaker on Sunday said that after Trotter dodged a previous question about what his favorite recipe was, he asked him what his last meal would be.\nOfstein, a radiologist, noticed that his left hand was shaking as he held the microphone but didn't think more about it.\n\"I said from one Chicagoan to another what would be your last meal and he answered, 'A 1900 Chateau Margaux' a vintage bottle of wine worth between $9,000 and $16,000.\nTribune reporter Carlos Sadovi contributed.\nVideo: Master Sommelier says Trotter's health was a\" time bomb\"", "The \"Eye in the Sky\" star says her film is all about raising the right questions, and says women need to speak up no matter what.\nHelen Mirren is shooting a film in New York. Even better, it\u2019s the first time she and her husband, director Taylor Hackford (\u201cRay\u201d), have ever worked in the same town at the same time.\nThe Oscar-winning actress (and Dame), now 70, is taking a break to talk about \u201cEye in the Sky,\u201d a British drama that most unfolds in real time. It traces as forces, from her colonel in London to a drone pilot (Aaron Paul) in Las Vegas, try to blow up a house containing terrorists \u2014 without accidentally killing a little girl playing near their target.\nDrones are something people can see in black-and-white terms, but \u201cEye in the Sky\u201d isn\u2019t interested in flattering either side. How did your thoughts on drones evolve on this film?\nYou know, you can\u2019t just say, \u201cDrones \u2014 what\u2019s my take on drones?\u201d Well, I don\u2019t want a drone coming into my back garden and taking pictures of me sunbathing. But I\u2019m sure as a surveillance tool, it\u2019s incredibly valuable and useful.\nYou might as well say, \u201cWhat\u2019s your attitude about telephones?\u201d People can phone each other up and plan terrible things. Do we ban telephones? It\u2019s a technology we\u2019re going to have to live with. You can\u2019t just suddenly get rid of it. So the question becomes how and where do we use them or not use them? The whole point of the film is to throw up those questions.\nIt raises a lot of questions, and even suggests at times that drones make war more precise and easier to cut down on collateral damage \u2014 though not completely.\nThe same questions have been thrown up since time immemorial. What do you sacrifice and to what end? Innocent people are always killed, in every war. War is about killing innocent people. In the 18th century, 17th century, there was incredible collateral damage: local people, farms. That\u2019s always been with us. Whenever there\u2019s war there\u2019s innocent people dying. The planes that flew over cities when the Brits bombed Dresden \u2014 they didn\u2019t know where their bombs were dropping either. And nor did they care.\nWere there things you were particularly surprised to learn while researching this?\nHonestly, my research was the script. But I didn\u2019t know that drone pilots sat in trailers in Las Vegas. The other interesting thing is fighter pilots, who had to then transition to becoming drone pilots, were useless at it \u2014 or not as good at it as kids who grew up playing video games. Kids who play games are used to it. Fighter pilots are used to being able to change the trajectory quickly, whereas drones take a bit of time. They could never get their heads around it, whereas kids who play video games are totally adroit at that.\nI always worry that the plethora of military video games have always been there to train soldiers from childhood.\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the case at all. But you know more than I do, because you\u2019re a man. It\u2019s such a boy thing. I\u2019m not saying gaming in general is a boy thing. Women are really getting involved in it now. But that side of gaming is such a male thing. We females sit back and go [makes a terrified face].\nSpeaking of which, this is a drama with a woman on the poster. Given how much we\u2019ve been talking about diversity, do you see Hollywood moving away from a purely boy- and superhero-driven landscape?\nYes, of course it will. People do need to speak up. I learned this with feminism. I\u2019ve always been a feminist, but when I was younger I was never a proselytizing feminist. I totally believed in my right to do and be whatever I wanted to be, and anything that was holding me back was profoundly unfair. But I never joined a feminist group.\nBut you know what? You do need to speak up, you do need to articulate the issues. And you get s\u2014 for it, you get mocked for it, you get dumped upon for it. But you\u2019re on the right side of history when you speak up. And things do change. Dialogue is really important.\nIt\u2019s been heartening that, over the last year, pieces about diversity and inequality have actually done well with readers. They get shared online. It\u2019s good for business, finally, to talk about it.\nYou journalists are very important, because for so long you didn\u2019t talk about it. You didn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s funny: You can talk till your f\u2014ing blue in the face. I\u2019ve done interviews all my life and I\u2019ve always talked about it. Did anyone print it? No. [Laughs] Not until it comes into the zeitgeist, if you like. Now it\u2019s in the zeitgeist, which is great. Mind you, that will pass as well. But the genie\u2019s out of the bottle.\nI did want to ask if you\u2019ve seen those web posts with side-by-side comparisons of younger pictures of you and Jennifer Lawrence now. The resemblance is uncanny.", "The Kings continue to try to figure out their offense, one that ideally has plenty of ball and player movement and flow.\nBut Sacramento hasn\u2019t had enough of that this season. The Kings entered Friday\u2019s game against the Portland Trail Blazers at Moda Center averaging 97.8 points, 25th in the NBA. Sacramento was 29th in pace at 95.34 possessions per 48 minutes.\nThe Kings\u2019 offensive rating was 19th at 101.2 points per 100 possessions.\nWhen the Kings\u2019 offense slows down, they\u2019re prone to rely on isolation basketball. DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay can excel one-on-one, but it\u2019s not ideal, and even then, they have to take tough shots against a set defense.\nGay did not express concern over how to get easier looks for himself and teammates.\nEarly-season excuses for struggles could be tied to players being unfamiliar with each other or insufficient practice time. Kings coach Dave Joerger, however, said it\u2019s his responsibility to get more out of the Kings on offense.\nThere are kinks to work out in that plan. As Joerger has noted, guards Arron Afflalo and Darren Collison can be scorers, but like Cousins and Gay, need freedom to go to their strengths, which can be in isolation situations.\nHaving four players like that on the court together is not ideal for ball or player movement. Joerger is experimenting with the best combinations, which probably means having Cousins or Gay on the floor at all times.\nLawson said the Kings just need to play faster and move the ball to maximize their offensive potential and not take bad shots that lead to scoring chances for opponents.\nLawson added that getting into offensive sets faster is not a matter of familiarity among players.\nLawson said with a quicker pace, the offense will look better immediately. He noted that in all of the Kings\u2019 losses they have had a tendency to show a lack of urgency.\nNotes \u2013 The Kings assigned rookies George Papagiannis, Malachi Richardson and Skal Labissiere to their NBA Development League affiliate in Reno on Friday.\nNone were in Joerger\u2019s regular rotation, so their best chance to play is with the Bighorns.\nPapagiannis, a center, and Labissiere, a forward, had appeared in only one game this season, last Saturday\u2019s blowout loss at Milwaukee. Richardson, a guard, had appeared in two games, at Milwaukee and late in the season-opening rout of Phoenix.\n\u25aa Friday\u2019s game concluded Sacramento\u2019s rough early schedule with 11 games in 17 days to start the season. The Kings had four sets of back-to-back games in that span and played seven of the games on the road.\nThe Kings\u2019 next game is Wednesday, when they host San Antonio at Golden 1 Center.", "Even after approval, one in three patients failed to fill their prescription. Sticker shock was a key factor. A quarter of patients had copays over $300 per month for therapies that cost about $14,000 a year.\nThe net result was that just 31 percent of patients who were initially prescribed a PCSK9 inhibitor ever actually received the therapy, the researchers found.\nThis study basically reveals a system of rationing by roadblocks.\nIn their study, which was funded by a manufacturer of one of the drugs, Navar and colleagues analyzed a large database of pharmacy claims that included more than 45,000 prescriptions for PCSK9 inhibitors. These drugs work by blocking a protein in the liver called proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9), setting off a chain of events that breaks down LDL cholesterol, the \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d that causes heart disease.\nThe drugs include evolocumab (brand name Repatha, manufactured by the study\u2019s funder, Amgen, Inc.) and alirocumab (brand name Praluent). Both therapies were approved by the FDA in 2015 for people with familial hyperlipidemia (a form of very high cholesterol that runs in families) and those with established heart disease who have high cholesterol despite traditional statin therapy.\nIn the first year after the drugs\u2019 approvals, the researchers found that nearly 80 percent of doctors\u2019 prescriptions were rejected by pharmacy benefit managers that govern drug coverage for health insurance plans. Most of the requests (73.5 percent) were resubmitted, but only 47.2 percent eventually won approval.\nThe median time between initial submission and approval was about four days, but some patients waited nearly three months for therapy.\nAmong patients who received approval, about 35 percent never picked up the medication, which was almost entirely due to high out-of-pocket costs. For example, more than 90 percent of approved patients who had no copayment filled their prescription, but if the copayment was over $300, only about 20 percent filled the prescription.\nNavar said the study had a limitation, in that it was not designed to assess what was driving pharmacy benefit managers to reject requests for prescriptions. Most patients in the study had Medicare coverage, but it was unclear whether and what clinical factors were taken into account by different pharmacy benefit managers.\nNavar and Peterson receive funding from Amgen and other pharmaceutical manufacturers; full disclosures are provided in the published study.", "More of the 3,225 people on average who ride the Richmond Highway Express (REX) bus line every day are going to be staring straight ahead, instead of out the rear window or at the face of the person across from them. Metro is replacing its old Orion buses on the route with versions that have more forward-facing seats. But the biggest change will be beneath the seats and in the atmosphere.\nMetro is rolling out twelve new buses in the next few weeks. Several are already on the road. The new buses run on compressed natural gas (CNG), rather than the low-sulfur diesel of the older buses.\nBob Golden, the Metro\u2019s Manager of Bus Engineering, said the CNG buses produce only 10 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions that a standard diesel bus would.\nThe two-year old REX route, an express running from King Street Station down to Fort Belvoir, is currently one of Metro\u2019s most popular, said Steve Petrocelli, Acting General Superintendent for Bus Transportation. And the new buses are coming at a time when ever-higher rider numbers are predicted. \u201cWe think it will become more popular with the [Fort Belvoir] base realignment,\u201d Petrocelli said.\nPetrocelli said the three most heavily used stops are Huntington Station, Beacon Center and Walmart. Rides cost $1.25.\nTHOUGH OIL PRICES are rising, the decision to switch to compressed natural gas was not made for economic reasons. The price of natural gas has actually overtaken diesel, according to Golden. \u201cWe feel it is worth the additional cost to provide these environmentally friendly buses,\u201d Golden explained.\n\u201cRidership is so high right now we\u2019re hoping that will offset some of [the added fuel costs],\u201d Petrocelli said.\nGolden said the Metro\u2019s next generation of buses are of three types: CNG, hybrid electric and clean-technology diesel. Petrocelli said the decision to make the REX fleet CNG was based on the wishes of the Virginia representatives of the Metro Board.\nPetrocelli said the fleet of REX buses was ordered several years ago, when hybrid technologies were still immature, and Metro did not think it would be prudent to place a large order of them.\nBoth types of buses are believed to be about equal in their greenhouse gas emissions, Golden said. CNG buses are cheaper individually than hybrids, but require a retrofit to their garage that can cost between $12 and $20 million. CNG buses in Virginia will use the Four Mile Run refueling station.\nCLEANER ENGINES are not the only upgrades to the new buses. Each is equipped with an automated monitoring system programmed to send a report to the fueling station when the bus is about 1,000 feet away. If the bus is okay, a green symbol appears on a screen at the station. If it needs maintenance, but can continue to run, a yellow symbol appears. If the bus needs to be taken out of circulation immediately, the symbol is red.\nThe buses also talk. If the bus needs service, it will complain of its condition while being refueled, according to Golden.\nThe biggest change riders of the new bus may notice will be the removal of rear-facing seats in the back, and a decrease in the number of side-facing seats. Golden said they expect this to be popular. Riders had complained of sitting shoulder-to-shoulder and facing backwards. The initial REX buses were some of the first of that type manufactured by Orion, Golden said. To maximize space, some awkward places, like the rearward facing seats, had to be built in. The new bus has slimmer seats that are still comfortable but less padded. They are also less susceptible to vandalism. Cutting them will only leave a slice, not a surge of stuffing. Total seat numbers will bump up from 38 to 41.\nThere are also acoustic sensors by the doors to keep them from closing on people, larger windows, more reliable air conditioning and security cameras. The graphics on the sides of the bus are painted on, instead of wrapped like an enormous decal, which means they will be more durable and less likely to scratch. The drivers have also been thrown a bone. Their pedals are now adjustable, so they don\u2019t have to pull the seat forward to the point that their bellies are rubbing against the steering wheel.\nAll of the changes were carefully premeditated. \u201cSince this was a premium service route we wanted to give [customers] a real comfortable ride,\u201d Golden said.\nANNA GARCIA and Maria Huarcaya said they use the REX frequently to connect to the 9A route. They sat down in some of the new REX bus\u2019s forward-facing seats. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d pronounced Garcia. Huarcaya concurred.\nTreva Barksdale, who also said she rode REX frequently, said the interior of the old bus was \u201cdull\u201d and \u201cdreary.\u201d She said she did not like the sideways seats that dominated the old version. \u201cI like looking forward,\u201d she said.\nBut Barksdale was concerned about the potential for the fuzzy seat-covers of the new version to absorb spills. Petrocelli assured her they were stain-resistant.", "Michael Bryant Lyons was born on June 15, 1945 to Oren and Lee Lyons in White City, New Mexico.

A first-team all-conference performer, Uskali retired the first six batters he faced in order before things started to unravel in the third.\nAfter Palmer\u2019s fourth home run of the season, Uskali (7-3) gave up three more runs in the fourth to conclude his shortest start of the year. He allowed seven runs on five hits and was pulled in favor of Cayce Rocco to start the fifth.\nCuesta had a difficult time getting the leadoff batter out in nearly every inning, which Miller said was a key factor in Chaffey\u2019s 10-run outburst. The Panthers\u2019 leadoff batter reached safely in six straight innings from the third through the eighth, four of them drawing walks.\nChaffey\u2019s No. 8 hitter, left fielder Jacob Arguello, seemed to be the hardest out for Cuesta\u2019s pitching staff. He went 3 for 3, was hit by a pitch and scored four times in the victory. No. 9 hitter Oscar Martinez (2 for 4) and Palmer (2 for 5) also had multiple hits for the Panthers.\nBut each time it looked like Chaffey might blow the game open, the Cougars found an answer.\nSophomore left fielder Nick Rutckyj followed up Palmer\u2019s grand slam with a three-run home run of his own to tie the score at 4-all. The Cougars continued to chip away at the deficit, scoring one run in the fifth, two in the seventh and one more in the eighth to pull within 9-8.\nA series of passed balls and wild pitches in the bottom of the eighth allowed Chaffey to score one more insurance run and brought the score to the final margin.\nCuesta leadoff hitter Dustin Miller, the Western State Conference Player of the Year, went 3 for 4 with two doubles, and his one-out single in the ninth briefly gave the Cougars hope. But Miller was picked off at first base, and Garrett Giovannelli hit a line drive to the shortstop to end the game two batters later.\nMiller said Jenkins (8-5) is scheduled to start Sunday\u2019s series finale. The hard-throwing sophomore proved to be the difference maker in Cuesta\u2019s first-round win over Palomar, and Miller expects more of the same this week.\n\u201cHaving Brendan, a guy who\u2019s been in that situation before, the career that he\u2019s had here at Cuesta, we\u2019ve got the right guy going for us,\u201d Miller said.", "Granville's girls soccer team is taking the quality, not quantity approach this fall.\nGRANVILLE - Last year's ending did not sit well with a Granville girls soccer program that has built itself into a Division II Central District powerhouse.\nFour consecutive runs to the Final Four, with a pair of state runnerup finishes, ended in a heartbreaking 1-0 shootout loss in the district finals to Big Walnut.\nThe Blue Aces have the talent for a return to the promised land, but not their usual depth. If they can stay healthy, big things are again expected.\n\"The numbers are low in the program,\" coach Scott Foster said. \"But this might be the greatest attack we've ever had. We don't have depth of numbers, but the quality is really good.\"\nGranville has just three seniors in All-Ohio center-midfielder Katie Cox, goalie Addison Hoover and outside defender Lauren Newkirk. There are just 22 players in the program, including freshmen. But the Blue Aces aren't fretting too badly.\n\"Even though the numbers are down, our pre-season was really good and we're only going to get better,\" said Cox, who will join older sister Nikki at Bowling Green next season. \"We have some really good underclassmen who already have experience. Communication is going to be big, and we will get better at it as the season goes along.\"\nThe Blue Aces flashed plenty of potential in a final tuneup scrimmage against New Albany, a perennial Division I district title contender. Junior Maddie Vradenburg exploded for four goals on her birthday and Cox added another as Granville prevailed 5-2. \"I don't think they were expecting to lose to us, let alone give up five goals,\" Forster told his team after the scrimmage.\n\"We kind of struggled at the beginning (of pre-season), but we've really come on these past couple of scrimmages,\" Hoover said afterwards. \"We need to keep up the physicality like we showed tonight, and not back down from teams. We might not have the depth, but we have enough skilled players to go a long way. We're a young team with room to grow.\"\nForster points to what he calls a five-pronged attack: center-midfielders Cox and Ella Rogers, who started as a freshman, and forwards Vradenburg, junior Alex Sokolik and Karah Van Horn, who also started as a freshman.\n\"It's really a front five,\" Forster said. \"Every one of them is really good and any one of them can score on a given day.\"\nLeading the defense are outside defenders Newkirk and sophomore Maddie Shoaps, along with junior center-defenders Sarah and Abby Mortellaro. Hoover has good reaction time and good hands in goal, getting good experience last year when the starter went down with injury.\nGranville continues to play primarily a Division I schedule as it defends its Licking County League championship. They have added defending regional champion Olentangy Liberty and defending regional runnerup Dublin Jerome. They were at Upper Arlington Monday and play at Bloom-Carroll Saturday. Last Friday's season opener at Jonathan Alder was postponed due to a flooded field and will be made up at a later date.\nDon't expect the Blue Aces' numbers to be down for long. \"We have a big junior class, so we'll be really strong again next year,\" Forster said. \"We also have some really good players at the junior high level.\"", "Visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and his Afghan counterpart, Abdullah Abdullah, on Wednesday discussed bilateral ties, the Afghan situation and exchanged views on international and regional issues of common concern.\nTang said the formation of the Afghan Interim Government has provided the two countries with an opportunity to develop friendship. He voiced China's support to the interim government and its readiness to push forward good-neighborly relations with Afghanistan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence.\nAs a neighbor, Tang said, China has been closely watching the development of the situation in Afghanistan. China sincerely hopes that leaders of all parties in Afghanistan could seize today's great opportunity and work for national reconciliation and social stability with the help of the international community, he said.\nThe Chinese foreign minister asked the international community to translate their promises into action in terms of assistance to Afghanistan. He said China pays attention not only to the peace process in Afghanistan, but also to its reconstruction. China has honored its assistance commitment of one million US dollars and goods worth 30 million RMB yuan (US$3.6 million).\nTang said China has agreed to send teams to study the refurbishment of previous assistance projects in Kabul, Parwan and Kandahar once security situation permits. It has also agreed to fulfill as soon as possible its pledges to provide Afghanistan with police uniforms and stationery and office supplies. Tang said China would seriously study other needs of Afghanistan as well.\nHe said Chinese businesses are ready for economic and technological cooperation with Afghanistan in various ways and on various levels.\nAt the request of the Afghan side, China has also agreed to resume consular and visa services in Afghanistan as soon as possible to facilitate exchanges between the two countries.\nDuring the talks, Tang also explained his country's Asia policy. He stressed that China's priority is to expand friendship with its Asian neighbors, safeguard security and stability and promote development and cooperation in the region. Peace and cooperation are also the goal of China's South Asia policy, he said.\nAbdullah said he was looking forward to Tang's visit. He thanked China for its assistance, describing China as Afghanistan' s only neighbor that has not hurt the country. China's contributions to peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan have shown that China is a great country in the world, he said.\nHe said Afghanistan would work with China to carry out cooperation projects and explore new areas of cooperation. With the help of China, Afghanistan will definitely overcome the difficulties and embark on the road to peace, stability and development, Abdullah stated.\nAbdullah said that Afghanistan's focus at home is peace and reconstruction and the priority of its foreign policy is to promote friendship with its neighbors and fight terrorism together with the international community.\nTang appreciated Afghanistan's firm stance on the fight against terrorism and expressed the hope that the two countries can enhance cooperation in this regard.\nThe two foreign ministers also exchanged views on cooperation in drug control. Tang said China is ready to provide agricultural technologies to help Afghan poppy growers to opt for other crops.\nAfter the talks, Tang and Abdullah witnessed the signing of three documents, including an agreement on economic and technological cooperation between the two countries.\nLater in the afternoon, Tang visited Jamhuriat Hospital, for which China has provided medical equipment.\nTang, who arrived in Kabul on Wednesday morning, had met with interim leader Hamid Karzai earlier in the day.", "Russian President Vladimir Putin has attended a junior judo competition in Vladivostok as part of the 2018 Eastern Economic Forum.\nAlso in attendance at the competition, which was held as part of the forum to strengthen business ties between countries across Asia, was Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe, Mongolian President Khaltmaagiin Battulga and International Judo Federation President Marius Vizer.\nThe International Jigoro Kano Junior Judo Tournament for under-18 judokas , which is named after the founder of judo, was first held as part of the Eastern Economic Forum last year and has been officially authorised by the International Judo Federation (IJF).\nThe Forum was held in the far Eastern Russian city of Vladivostok from September 11 to 13, with the judo competition featuring 16 weight categories and judokas from five countries; Russia, China, Japan, South Korea and Mongolia.\nJudokas from Russia and Japan reached each final with the overall score ending 8-8, meaning two athletes from the under-90 kilogram category fought again to decide the overall winner.\nRussia won the final event to take gold, while Japan took silver and South Korea bronze.\nPutin personally awarded the medals alongside Abe and Battulga.\nThe Russian President thanked Abe and Battulga as well as the organisers of the event.\n\"I would like to extend my congratulations to all participants in the tournament,\" he said.\n\"I want to say that the boys and girls showed us good judo today, including the technique, the fervour and the will for victory.\"\nRussian President Putin is himself a black belt in the sport and attended last year's IJF World Championships in Budapest.\nThe Eastern Economic Forum took place before the tournament, with discussions including international cooperation across Asia, especially in the build up to the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.\nThe forum was created by Putin in 2015 and is held in Vladivostok every year at the Far East Federal University.", "Two-thirds of the adult-youth partnerships established through a national mentoring program proved to be effective relationships that were satisfying to both parties, an independent study has found.\nThe report, the first product of a four-year research initiative examining several mentoring programs, also found that the most effective relationships in the Linking Lifetimes program were those in which the youth had a voice in determining the types of activities the pair engaged in.\nThe study was conducted between April 1990 and March 1991 by Public/Private Ventures, a not-for-profit corporation in Philadelphia that designs and evaluates programs that serve youths.\nDeveloped by Temple University's Center for Intergenerational Learning, Linking Lifetimes unites mentors ages 55 and older with at-risk youths ages 12 to 17.\nThe P.P.V. study focused on 26 mentoring pairs interviewed at Learning Lifetimes programs in Springfield, Mass.; Memphis; Los Angeles; and Miami.\nThe authors of the P.P.V. study called \"significant'' the finding that the majority of relationships flourished, and noted that improvements in screening and training of volunteers might lead to an even higher success rate.\nThe majority of the youths interviewed reported being interested in the program in order to \"go places'' with the mentor, and the report's authors said mentors should be encouraged to do just that initially.\nMentors should also be told, the report said, that following the youth's interests builds trust, an important program goal.\nThe Linking Lifetimes study offers \"a lot of good common sense that can boil down to good programmatic sense,'' said Michael A. Bailin, president of P.P.V.\nIn addition to Linking Lifetimes, the P.P.V. research will examine two of its own programs as well as Big Brothers/Big Sisters programs, college-based mentoring programs funded by Campus Compact, and programs sponsored by the I Have a Dream Foundation in Washington.\nBy examining such diverse programs, the organization will try to gauge mentoring's usefulness as an intervention for at-risk youths and help shed light on a little-studied public-policy area.\n\"With all you have heard about mentoring, with all that noise, there is very little known about in what instances it works or doesn't work,'' Mr. Bailin said.\nThe initiative is expected to address the supply of adults for mentoring, the adaptability of mentoring to such large institutions as juvenile-justice agencies; whether there is a way to characterize the adult role in a successful partnership; what training, services, and costs are part of an effective program; and whether participation changes the young people or the mentors.", "\u201cI would never let my own relatives come here,\u201d were the worrying words of a Grantham Hospital employee, who has contacted the Journal to voice his concerns.\nThe call revealed how low morale has fallen among some staff, as they strive to provide care to patients in the face of increasing financial pressure and a limited workforce.\nAnother Grantham Hospital employee got in touch via the Journal\u2019s Facebook page to highlight how, despite the trying circumstances, she and her colleagues are working extra hard to provide patients with the best possible care.\n\u201cI, for one, am very proud to be part of an amazing team,\u201d said Karen Newton. \u201cNothing is ever perfect, it can\u2019t be \u2013 we are simply human beings doing the best we can in less than the best of circumstances.\n\u201cBefore any hospital or trusts get slated, I\u2019d urge you to consider the pressures placed upon staff. We answer bells when we can, we help and assist when and where we can. It\u2019s easy for people to see and misjudge why bells are going unanswered and circumstances are far from perfect, however I\u2019d ask you to consider the healthcare staff who miss out on breaks, and leave later than their shift time should finish, unpaid as it\u2019s our time management, and all because we\u2019re putting patients needs before our own.\n\u201cWe come home tired and hungry, and often disheartened as we couldn\u2019t do more, or our best wasn\u2019t good enough that day, or we\u2019ll be in trouble for failing yet another paper trail audit.\nThe latest report by the Care Care Quality Commission rated Grantham Hospital \u2013 run by the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULHT) \u2013 as \u2018good\u2019, but an NHS staff survey published last year actually included a question asking them to rate how much they agreed with the statement: \u2018If a friend or relative needed treatment I would be happy with the standard of care provided by this organisation\u2019. Only 42 per cent of ULHT staff who responded agreed with this, below the national average of 47 per cent. Ten per cent of ULHT\u2019s respondents said they disagreed, and three per cent strongly disagreed.\nHe added: \u201cWe would expect the trust to be paying attention to those results.\nAs with many across the country, ULHT has been holding recruitment drives to try and fill vacancies and reduce its dependency on agency staff. It has also gone abroad to recruit, and recently recruited 131 Filipino nurses having previously hired nurses from Greece, Spain and Portugal.\nResponding to the survey results, ULHT\u2019s director of HR and organisational development Ian Warren said: \u201cWe know the staff survey results could be higher, but they are heading in the right direction.\n\u201cSince 2014, the scores have improved with staff saying that they are more motivated, better engaged and less likely to be stressed through work.\nStaff members\u2019 comments have also been brought to the attention of Grantham MP Nick Boles. In a Journal column last month, he said: \u201cI want ULHT to succeed and will work with it to develop new and improved services at Grantham Hospital.\nThis week, Mr Boles told the Journal: \u201cGrantham Hospital has the best safety record of any of the three hospitals in ULHT and most of the people who contact me after they have received treatment there sing the praises of the staff and tell me they received excellent care.\nA recent outbreak of the norovirus at Grantham Hospital has added to staffing pressures.\nMichelle Rhodes, director of nursing, said: \u201cGrantham Hospital currently has a few staff off work with norovirus. However, the numbers are not high.\n\u201cAt times on all our wards, staffing can be challenging, and there is no doubt that they are very busy, but we have been able to maintain safe staffing levels on both wards affected by norovirus. The matrons review the staffing for each shift at least three times each day, and also plan ahead for weekends, and will move staff from ward to ward where needed to ensure there are the right number of nurses for the patients.\n\u201cRemaining shortages are filled by ULHT bank staff, and agency staff. These reviews of staffing levels are also closely monitored and scrutinised each day by heads of nursing, and any unresolved issues are escalated to senior managers.\n\u201cWe have established processes in place for staff to raise any concerns they may have and actively encourage this. Where we know there are any issues we will respond and address them.\nLots of readers have responded on our Facebook page to the issues at Grantham Hospital highlighted on page 5 of today\u2019s edition of the Grantham Journal, including many who conversely were full of praise for the care being provided in difficult circumstances.\nn ULHT will hold a recruitment open day tomorrow (Saturday), at Lincoln County Hospital, to give people the chance to find out about working at there and at Grantham, Boston and Louth.", "UB graduate student Alexa Russo\u2019s one-story row-house design was chosen to be a new build reality. Her construction drawings are currently being used as the basis of the Inclusive Design Spring 2018 studio, with plans to be built by next summer.\nThe issue of affordable housing is a nationwide concern, and University at Buffalo students are making strides to address the problem at home. Namely, an architecture studio that prototyped construction innovations, and graduate planning students that worked on Buffalo's East Side to promote reinvigoration without displacement.\nArchitecture professor Edward Steinfeld and the IDeA center are in the midst of a two-semester design/build graduate studio working to design affordable housing to be sited within the City of Buffalo. Last semester, students carefully considered material efficiency, cost, and clever construction choices. These innovations allowed for more flexibility in the budget to be used toward comfort, accessibility for all, and aesthetics. UB graduate student Alexa Russo\u2019s one-story row-house design was chosen to be a new build reality. Her construction drawings are currently being used as the basis of the Inclusive Design Spring 2018 studio, with the anticipation that it will be built by next summer.\nAnother research endeavor in affordable housing at the School of Architecture and Planning is being led by professor Henry Taylor of the Center for Urban Studies. Taylor's fall 2017 graduate urban planning studio explored strategies that would reinvigorate an East Side neighborhood without displacing current residents, and grappled with the issue of gentrification. The target study neighborhood was an area anchored by the King Urban Life Center, a non-profit agency that has served parts of the East Side since 1986.\nTaylor's students focused on creating pathways to resident self-agency and community based ownership of the neighborhood. The class proposed creating a community land trust for the King Urban Life Neighborhood, with the intent to create affordable housing that the current residents could sustain. Other strategies included establishing a volunteer code inspector team to hold absentee landlords responsible for maintaining their properties and strategic infill development.\nCome join us on April 10 for the University at Buffalo Affordable Housing Symposium!

In each case the denoument was highly farcical, and the reputed corpses are now hunting in a lively manner for that telephonist.\"\nThink about that: All it took was eight years for some 19th Century Bart Simpson to cast aside any respect or wonderment there may have been for this technological marvel and transform the telephone into an instrument of tomfoolery. By way of comparison, it was fully twice that long after the launch of the World Wide Web before someone executed the first Rickroll.\n\"I have a pretty uncreative notion of the line between fact and fiction; what I write might use narrative technique, but I stick to the facts.

I started the work right around when construction [of the new arena] was happening.\nPuddu, an assistant professor at MacEwan University (and PhD candidate at the University of Alberta\u2019s school of public health), worked with Boyle Street Community Services and the PLACE Research Lab on the photo project.\n\u201cThe important thing for me is we\u2019re seeing their lives from their perspective, from their viewpoint, from the photography,\u201d Puddu said.\nThose interviews \u2014 direct quotes from the young photographers \u2014 are included in the pages of Voices From The Street.\n\u201cI love expressive learning and how it was a-day-in-the-life, basically,\u201d Vicki Moses, 23, said.\nMoses was one of the photographers who took part in the project. She struggled with homelessness on and off since she was 20. She is currently housed but embraced the opportunity to shed light on life on the streets two summers ago.\nOne of Moses\u2019 featured photographs was a shot that includes Rogers Place on one side and a group of homeless people on the other \u2014 separated by a city street.\n\u201cIt was really captivating,\u201d she said. \u201cThe beautiful sunset with the Rogers on one place and it\u2019s literally like this road is a divide\u2026 What I had said as white privilege, you know, and then homelessness, MacDonald Lofts, Boyle Street.\nMoses believes Edmonton\u2019s most vulnerable populations are being overlooked as all this development happens around the new arena.\n\u201cThey\u2019re definitely being pushed out of the area,\u201d Moses said. \u201cThe Katz Group had said they wouldn\u2019t affect the downtown population and I\u2019m not too sure which population they were referring to, but it seemed like they were not referring to the homeless community,\u201d she said.\nREAD MORE: What impact will Rogers Place have on Edmonton\u2019s vulnerable?\nThe 23-year-old feels Voices From The Streets has given a voice to those who may not normally have a platform of any kind.

Andrew Cuomo will sign into law legislation that calls the popular online contests a \"game of skill.\"\nThat legal definition in a bill passed by Albany lawmakers early Saturday resolves the central argument in a lawsuit brought against the country's two top companies by the state attorney general, who had previously likened the online matches to illegal gambling operations based on chance.\nIn March, New York-based FanDuel and Boston-based DraftKings agreed to stop operations in the state pending the passage of a law that would resolve the ambiguity.\nBut under the stipulation with Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, they can't start operating again until Cuomo, a Democrat, signs the bill into law by July 1.\nCuomo hasn't indicated whether he'll sign the law, and his spokesman said Saturday that aides were reviewing the bill.\nSchneiderman said in a statement he would enforce the law as it's written but resolved to continue to pursue previously filed false advertising and consumer fraud claims against the companies.\nDaily fantasy sports became wildly popular ahead of the 2015 NFL football season, when the companies flooded TV, radio and the internet with ads promoting their games as easy ways for the average sports fan to win big.\nBut the advertising blitz also drew the eye of regulators like Schneiderman, who argued the entry fees players paid to manage a roster of teams like a general manager were actually wagers \u2014 and the contests themselves were highly dependent on factors out of a player's control.\nThe legislation requires fantasy sports companies to register with the state Gaming Commission, paying an annual fee of up to $50,000 and being subject to a 15 percent tax on their revenue.\nIt also bars anyone younger than 18 from playing and prohibits college and high school sports.\nDraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement after the legislation passed the state Senate that he was hopeful Cuomo would sign the bill into law.", "Published: June 4, 2016 at 01:00 p.m.\nUpdated: June 4, 2016 at 05:18 p.m.\nThe Washington Redskins boast one of the deepest pass-catching corps in the entire NFL.\nGeneral manager Scot McCloughan added first-round pick Josh Doctson to complement DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon, while locking up Kirk Cousins' security blanket Jordan Reed long-term. The underrated aspect of the group remains second-year receiver Jamison Crowder.\nAs a rookie, Crowder posted 59 receptions for 604 yards and two touchdowns. With Jackson skipping offseason workouts and Doctson nursing an injury, Crowder has taken the opportunity to secure his place in the Redskins' offense.\n\"I feel comfortable coming back knowing the offense,\" Crowder said, via CSN Mid-Atlantic. \"Looking forward to going out there and making plays and helping out the team as much as I can.\"\nThe 'making plays' refrain has become the wideout's offseason motto.\nThe 5-foot-8 Crowder provided shifty playmaking out of the slot last season. It's a role he expects to retain, despite the addition of Doctson to a deep receiving corps.\n\"I don't see my role changing much from last year, (just) making sure I get open and make plays,\" Crowder said.\nIf Jackson, Garcon and Doctson all stay healthy, it could put Crowder's snaps in jeopardy, but he has the faith of his quarterback. Cousins believes Crowder's ability to separate from defensive backs will allow the second-year player to make a leap in 2016.\n\"All of that lends itself to taking another step forward,\" Cousins recently. \"He's a great teammate, smart player, has a natural sense of how to get open, how to run different option routes and choice routes, great natural hands and is really good after the catch pulling away from people.\"\nWith Jackson's speed, Reed's red-zone playmaking, Doctson's high-point catching ability, Garcon's route running and Crowder's slot acumen, Cousins has as diverse a set of pass-catchers as any QB in the NFL.", "Not in line with the spirit of the security council. Don't make me laugh China . Bit of self reflection before making a comment like that.\nChina should get off their arses and pull the plug on all the BS coming from North Korea, instead of telling everyone else what they should or shouldn't do.\nYeah China... Until you start putting a little pressure on your baby NK instead of backing them up we might as well be saying you launched the missile over Hokkaido.\nCan you believe this crap out of both China and Russia.... neither country wants Japan to put up a missile defense system nor do they want sanctions against N. Korea. But all the while N. Korea is launching missiles over Japan itself and threatening Japan too. If India were threatening China with a Nuclear Missile attack do you think China would just forget about it and do nothing? Let me say this.... you know who your enemy is when they take the opposite side of you in a rational dispute and clearly both China and Russia are doing this.\nChina is right. What did Abe's sanctions do to NK in the last 5 years? One test after another. Is it sufficient to prove that Abe's policy in North East Asia is a big wrong ?\nYeah... Pre-emptive strikes is a much better option.\nSlapping sanctions on one country for the actions of another is a pretty dangerous road to start down.\nOh yes China. And if NK fired a missile over Chinese territory, you wouldn't do the same or more......?\n@serendipitous1 Japan nationalized Chinese Senkaku, does China occupy Japan ?\nAbe must abandon the concept that only force or violence would resolve neighbor's problems.\nChina shall walk the talk and obey the international court ruling over the South Chinese Sea first.\n@Ghost Not all rulings are justice. Sometimes, ruling are another way of injustice.\nJapan needs to show it's a true leader in international affairs, cut the bombast, and ask NK to come to the table. Might sting a bit, but if they do, promise the remove some of the fresh sanctions, and ASK NK not to fire open Japan, there's a chance they'd comply. If they keep up the bombast instead, I guarantee another missile flies over, maybe lands closer, by week's end... maybe several.\ntough talk's only make NK double down, and win.\nChina you got some nerve don't ya!!! CHINA is THE major reason for the present state we are all living in in the Far East & SE Asia!\nIts is getting high time the world needs to stand up to China's govt BS! Ditto for Russia!\nI feel sorry for the peoples of both those countries who have ZERO choice in their \"\"leadership\"\"\nWhile Japan making changes will rile up its neighbours it pretty much has NO CHOICE but to do so the way things are going with damned missiles flying DIRECTLY overhead!! Hell THAT could be interpreted as an act of war!\nThe future is looking bleak now on the war front as well as all the economic & demographic issues, NOT GOOD!\nIf Japan hasn't lied so many times, cheated so many times, broke promises so many times, perhaps NK would have no nuclear weapons at all.\nAbey, how is that PRC money?\nJapan of old is plenty guilty of many a thing but currently Japan is no threat to NK, or China as it stands..\nJapan isn't the one the one breaking promises made about in exchange for money and aid, Japan isn't the one threatening total destruction of other countries.\nIn the news just now, NK is apparently loading a H-Bomb into a missile... now if its real or just PR who knows..\nNo-one wants war on the Korean Peninsula, but a isolated dictator with a nuclear missile after making direct threats to various countries.. maybe he does need taking out.\nCan see the day South Korea & Japan have nuclear missiles. Not a great outcome for China or Russia but one they should have seen coming. They have no choice but to go down the MAD path. North Korea will never give up its nukes. We all know that. They have stated it a billion times. Russia is right about that. So its about time the international community accepts it and allows South Korea & Japan to do like wise. Well, whether they accept or not is immaterial. it's really about the pace in which they come to the conclusion that it is necessary and whether the U.S decides to provide them with the technology unilaterally. Both could probably do it themselves, but the luxury of time is gone now. Keep in mind they had strategic nukes stationed in South Korea up until the 90's. It wasn't so long ago.\nIt all follows a familiar pattern of adversarial behaviour around the world going nuclear. India v Pakistan, Russia v Europe, the U.S v China. On and on it goes.\nThat's the nature of the world in which we live.\nI aver. The best way to go with the NK is to bring it in the fold. Make it a partner in every way. Open the boarders, free trade, etc. By giving it a place among others, it becomes a partaker of the gains or loss in the shares. All NK neighbors are highly developed, there's a lot more advantage for them in having NK as a partner than the head-banging-no-result sanctions, which only hurt the ordinary people.\nWhy do people expect China to help get rid of KJU? and have who in his place, a democrat, a \"frindley\" guy to us ? If you think seriously about it, you would know that it is better to use soft-power in this NK's case.\nAbe is a liar. He said he will do anything to protect Japanese people. But did he talk to NK once ? Did he visit NK once ? Did he offer any help to cease NK nuclear program once ?\nChina is the only country that can help Japan in protecting Japanese people but what does Abe do to China? He call China a threat. He sanctions China for not doing enough. What a fool he is.\nFully agree, remove all reasons/causes for conflict, same counts for and all other conflicts.\nBullies disappear soon when a hand in friendship and no hard feelings is extended. No longer a Christian but that is the meaning of turning the other cheek to me i.e. stand fast and unwavering in your conviction and actions.\nBe the stone that the bully can't wring blood from but alas that type of person is very rare now.\nPerhaps if someone launches a missile at China, we can hope they too will not only not retaliate, but also not impose sanctions on them.\nIts a deliberately insulting statement.\nI think japan needs to get some serious anti missile defense installed.\nWhere you are right is China could be helping but it isn't, it is so afraid of having democracy and freedom of information directly on its boarders (admittedly with all the good and bad that brings) it would rather help keep an unpredictable human rights violating dictator in power.. good job.\nIm glad for the Chinese tourism here, sure it can be a little annoying in some aspects but glad lots of Chinese go home realizing that Japan isn't so bad after all.\nAnd today tested a nuclear weapon it seems.. China needs to step up or get out of the way..\nSeriously who gives flying crap what china say. They cannot be and should never ever be be trusted on any subject at ant time. China please keep your worthless self-serving comments to yourself, as you always keep reminding the world \"stay out of our business\" well back at you china. You are just as dangerous as NK.\nabey: China is the only country that can help Japan in protecting Japanese people but what does Abe do to China? He call China a threat. He sanctions China for not doing enough. What a fool he is.\nChina always seems to make a bigger fool of themselves whenever they make a statement, but this one really takes the cake. Most significantly it really exposes China's true intentions towards Japan, and by extension their adversarial status towards the US and its allies. China should be treated as such, and the free world should sanction China until they put NK down. I vote for 45% tariffs on all Chinese imports into the US, and suggest all concerned nations consider the same. Let China know that keeping the Kim Dynasty in power isn't worth China's growth and economy. A trade war doesn't kill anybody like a real war.\n@Oss If China doesn't help to calm NKorea down, the situation would be much worse. Appreciate Chinese role is the only way to resolve NKorea problem, peacefully.\n@NZ2011 Attempt is not enough.\n@just I come from where the Sun rises.\nChina should be refused entry into the US Market. Any country that trades with NKorea should be prohibited from trading with the US. That is about the only way that China will force NKorea to stand down.\nMake it a partner in every way. Open the boarders, free trade, etc. By giving it a place among others, it becomes a partaker of the gains or loss in the shares.\nIf there is one place where the PRC and the DPRK are similar, it is that in essence BOTH have that method tried on them (China is still having it tried on them now). In both cases, both countries lapped up the benefits as if it was their entitlement, and the countries that tried to befriend them were left holding the pan.\nNK may have progressed down this path more quickly without the sanctions, or perhaps not, we will never know. But the way I read it, the angle China has is that Japan will just make their situation worse and be a more likely target of NK if they increase sanctions- I seems like a mild threat but also seems a likely conclusion to me.\nChina hoped that Japan would work to improve bilateral relations by \"restoring mutual trust and rebuilding friendship instead of thinking about futile matters.\"\nSorry, China is Japan's biggest trading PARTNER [ an equal relationship ]. Japan had a so-so relationship with North Korea and then it turned hostile. I remember Japanese police raiding offices of NKs institutions, banning the Nambiongo-go ferry, harassment of NK's citizens and school (even Children !) and whipping up emotions among Japanese using the abduction issue which was being handled at a high diplomatic level. As usual, being an economically superior country, Japan thought it could bully NK to get its way.

I couldn\u2019t even afford a hoover. I just had to use other people\u2019s stuff.\n\"I just went flyering constantly to try and start the business and waited for phone calls to come in.\n\"For the first couple of weeks I was quite nervous, but then the calls started to come in and soon I was getting referrals too.\"\nGrowing up, Rachael had no idea what she wanted to do - until she started cleaning her mum's house for extra cash when she was 17.\nShe said: \"My mum was paying her cleaner \u00a340-a-week for four hours and I was coming back for a two-hour lecture and she\u2019d be walking home.\n\"My mum wasn\u2019t happy with the standard, so that\u2019s where I got the idea for my company.\n\"I could see the stress it put on my mum, because she was busy with two children and a teacher herself, working long hours further away.\n\"I said 'I\u2019ll do it for a bit of extra money' and when I was sitting my business A-levels I started writing all of my ideas for this cleaning business I was going to grow.\"\nRachael, who's married to fellow entrepreneur Daniel Stanley, 35, was cleaning for 20 customers a week at first, and handing flyers to all her clients' neighbours to cut down on her travel between houses.\nShe was physically cleaning for 50 hours a week, with the dedicated teen also doing bookkeeping on Saturdays, visiting customers to price up jobs in the evenings and handing out more flyers on Sundays.\nShe said: \"I was about a year in when I hired a couple of members of staff.\n\"One lady I met doing catering for my dad, we used to double-up to clean together, that\u2019s what I would do to train people until they were ready to do their own rounds.\n\"By the time I was 21 we had 20 members of staff.\n\"Then I won a UK Young Entrepreneur Award, that was a really inspiring moment because it was out of 1,400 people.\n\"I felt then that I belonged in the business community and stopped thinking 'just because I\u2019m young no-one will take me seriously'.

Ever. So. Slowly.\nSimple drawing of a cloud and a ladder against a turquoise sky.\nThe wage gap has been a thing\u2014an unfortunate, unfair thing\u2014for a long time, but many Americans don\u2019t believe in its existence. Believe it, because women earned 83% of what men did in 2015, according to a new analysis by The Pew Research Center of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nPew studied the earnings of full- and part-time workers in the United States, broken down across gender and race. At $21 an hour in median hourly earnings, white men out-earned pretty much everybody, except for Asian men, who made an average of $24 an hour. The lowest paid group of all was Hispanic women, at $12 an hour, followed by black women at $13 an hour. White women earned $17 an hour \u2014 less than the $18 an hour of Asian women, but more than black ($15/hour) or Hispanic ($14/hour) men.\nThe gender wage gap stubbornly persists despite incremental progress since 1980. These gains, according to Pew, can be explained at least in part by an increase in education and work experience of women over time. However, significant gaps in education may contribute to why certain groups continue to lag behind. Workers with a four-year college degree tend to earn significantly more than those without a degree. But the gap is especially evident for college-educated black and Hispanic women, who earn about 70% of what college-educated white men do.\nJust a few dimes to the dollar in pay disparity can add up to an average of $10,800 in lost earnings per year, according to a recent report by Rep. Carolyn Maloney. That means close to $500,000 over the course of a woman\u2019s career.\nMillennial women may not experience the full effects of the wage gap until later in their careers. While 75% of millennial women feel that the country still needs to work on improving gender equality, the hourly earnings of women ages 25-34 were 93% that of men in 2012, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center report. That gap appears to widen, however, once women reach their 30s. By the time women hit their 50s, they earn 38% less than their male counterparts according to TIME and Motto\u2019s wage gap research.", "1 What Is Dissonance in Marketing?\n3 What Is Selective Demand Advertising?\nCognitive dissonance is the state of mind that holds opposing, and even irreconcilable ideas, at the same time. It's a state of mind that most people find sufficiently uncomfortable to motivate them to find some way of reconciling the two views \u2013 for instance, by rejecting the authority of one of the views. Often, the resolution is irrational. Marketing strategies that employ cognitive dissonance can be effective, although only within certain limits.\nPeople are hardwired to seek consistency in their views and behaviors. Cognitive dissonance occurs when information comes along that runs counter to your beliefs.\nHere's an everyday example of cognitive dissonance. You're a liberal voter (or a conservative voter \u2013 it works equally well in both instances) and you read a newspaper article about an African-American man. According to the article, he is innocent of a terrible crime but was convicted and sentenced to die, based on what the authors describe as clearly faked evidence set up by a sheriff's department. Legal groups devoted to freeing wrongly convicted prisoners have appealed the case to the governor, asking him to allow a blood test that could prove the man's guilt or innocence. The governor has not responded to the request, either way.\nIf you're a liberal, you may find that your general approval of a liberal governor conflicts with his refusal to honor a request that could save an innocent man's life. If you're a conservative, you agree with the governor's refusal to grant yet one more opportunity to an already convicted felon. But this conflicts with your general disapproval of this liberal Democratic governor.\nLiberal or conservative, you're confronted with an article that requires you to reconcile two views that oppose each other, which is the essence of cognitive dissonance. Conservative readers may resolve the dissonance by concluding that the article had a liberal media bias (fake news!) and that the real facts were so clearly indicative of the man's guilt that even a liberal governor couldn't justify granting the request. Liberal readers may resolve the dissonance by concluding that the governor will eventually respond by ordering the needed test.\nCognitive dissonance strategies that require a consumer to reconcile two conflicting views by buying a product can be effective in marketing, especially if the reconciliation of opposing views protects or enhances the consumer's self-image.\nFor instance, you consider yourself a savvy automotive enthusiast. In the course of a visit to a high-end auto dealership, the salesperson emphasizes that \"a lot of Americans aren't sophisticated enough to understand why this car is actually a great buy.\" On the one hand, if you resist the sales pitch for this very expensive car, you appear unsophisticated; on the other hand, if you agree, then you're progressing down the marketing patch toward the purchase of a car you can't afford.\nFaced with this kind of cognitive dissonance, many consumers will go along with the sales pitch to avoid being viewed as an unsophisticated person without the real knowledge required to fully appreciate the car.\nMost marketing strategies that employ cognitive dissonance in the service of selling a product rely on our desire to be perceived favorably \u2013 for example, as sophisticated, hip, knowledgeable or affluent. We might ordinarily not buy the product because it doesn't interest us, too expensive or for any other good reason. This understandable desire to see ourselves favorably motivates the purchase, which is how a marketing strategy that relies on cognitive dissonance encourages consumers to resolve the dissonance in the situation.\nCognitive dissonance strategies in marketing only work within limits. Generally and somewhat counter intuitively, the stronger the consumer's view that the advertising potentially opposes, the better the strategy can work. But if the distance between the consumer's view and that offered through the marketing strategy is too great, the consumer may reject the approach and the product. The end result can be active disdain for the product or the company that makes the product, along with the ad itself.\nThe New York Times: Was Kevin Cooper Framed for Murder?\nAllBusiness: Can You Use Cognitive Dissonance to Create More Successful Advertising?\nGleeson,, Patrick. \"What Is Cognitive Dissonance in Marketing?\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/cognitive-dissonance-marketing-55693.html. 01 March 2019.\nWhat Are the Differences Between the Organizational and Consumer Markets?", "Sinead O\u2019Connor is facing her inner demons and her painful past.

But does it really make that much of a difference?\nThe annual list is put together by the Environmental Working Group, a U.S.-based health research and advocacy organization. For the fifth year in a row, apples have been the biggest offender when it comes to pesticide residue. According to analysts, that\u2019s because of chemicals applied to the crop before and after harvest to preserve them longer.\nThere\u2019s also the \u201cClean Fifteen.\u201d The produce on that list is the least likely to hold pesticide residue, according to EWG.

Creative Commons Licensed.\nThe right-wing Leave campaign promoted anti-immigrant sentiment to achieve its political goals. The fallout has been the legitimisation of bare-faced racism. Immediately post-Brexit there has been a 57% rise in racist incidents. Those who swallowed right-wing scapegoating of immigrants for problems caused by austerity and mismanagement feel they have been given a platform to publicly abuse people.\nAny implication that borders would be tightened represents opportunistic rhetoric. In his post Brexit speeches, Boris recognised migrants' clear value to our economy, and he made no commitment to changing our immigration laws.\nBut now Boris is gone and we face the specture of Tory, and perhaps Labour, leadership candidates opportunistically ramping up the rhetoric over tightening our borders. New front runner Teresa May has already shown herself willing to do this.\nDocsNotCops fights against racist discourse and laws that discriminate against the most vulnerable.\nWe challenge the blame levelled at migrants for the government\u2019s failings, in particular around the NHS. People in Britain are rightly proud of the NHS - but this pride was manipulated by the Leave campaign, who will ultimately not protect a public national health service.\nWithin hours of the result, Nigel Farage backtracked on his promise to inject an extra \u00a3350 million a week into the NHS.\nAnd now Oliver Letwin - who declared that \u2018the NHS will not exist within 5 years of a Conservative government\u2019 ,wrote a blueprint for privatising the NHS, and is widely thought to be behind the 2012 act - has been appointed to lead the Conservatives\u2019 Brexit unit.\nWe recognise that people had various reasons to vote Leave. Out of the chaos that has ensued, we would like to propose our hopes for the future: healthcare should be free at the point of use for all, to protect public health and the NHS\u2019s founding principles.\nPatients should not be discriminated against on the basis of their nationality which, in the absence of adequate training, is often conflated with race, surname or accent. Healthcare workers should not be forced to work as border guards. So-called \u2018health tourism\u2019 should be recognised as a fallacy: in the NHS, a migrant is more likely to treat you than be ahead of you in the queue.\nAs well as being wary of the new legislation that could emerge from Brexit, we need to focus on healing the wounds that the referendum has laid bare. We are a nation divided; we must work together to find unity. At the recent Annual Representatives meeting, the BMA voted to denounce the Immigration Act and promote the value that migrant workers bring to the NHS.

The latest divas to engage in a war of the words confined to 140 characters are Nicki Minaj and Cher. To be fair, it wasn't exactly Minaj and Cher directly exchanging words or verbal barbs. It was Minaj's Barbs -- her pet name for her fans -- who started spouting off to Cher. It had the makings of a mini feud, but the drama between these wig lovers seems to have died down with relative quickness.\nIt all started when a fan told Cher that Nicki dissed her in 'Did It On 'Em,' where the pink loving MC raps \"If you could turn back time, Cher / You used to be here, now you're gone Nair.\" Whatever that means.\nThat said, Cher replied to the tweet, saying she's seen many new artists come and go in her time and that she essentially wasn't getting her knickers in a knot over Minaj's commentary within the space of her song. Cher was dismissing it as no biggie, since it is she who remains a constant of divadom.\nThen Minaj fans AKA \"Barbs\" chimed in, saying it was a compliment not a diss.\nCher even said she's been dissed before and should have educated herself about the song before commenting and that maybe her comments were said in haste.\nMinaj, an active tweeter, even injected herself into the fracas, writing \"Stop\" to Cher's handle.\nYou can read the run of tweets by following each diva at her Twitter handle.\nIt seems blown out of proportion to us.

Then why have three states specifically exempted it from their rules for lobbyists?\nOn April 20, Common Cause submitted a whistleblower complaint to the IRS, claiming that the American Legislative Exchange Council is \u201ca corporate lobbying group masquerading as a charity.\u201d The move was the latest salvo in progressive groups\u2019 campaign to limit the influence of ALEC, a secretive nonprofit that brings together Republican state legislators and corporations to write and promote pro-business legislation.\nIt could take several years for the IRS to decide whether ALEC is indeed a lobbying group required to register and disclose how much it spends on influencing legislation. But in three states\u2014South Carolina, Indiana, and Colorado\u2014ALEC has quietly, and by name, been specifically exempted from rules for lobbyists.\nThe laws in those states allow ALEC to spend millions annually hosting corporate lobbyists and legislators at three yearly conferences, send \u201cissue alerts\u201d to legislators recommending votes on pending legislation, and draft boilerplate press releases for legislators to use when pushing ALEC model bills\u2014all without registering as a lobbyist or reporting these expenditures. Legislators can receive scholarships from ALEC\u2019s corporate donors to attend conference events, or they can legally go on the taxpayer dime.\nThese exemptions are just now coming to light. In South Carolina, Democratic Rep. Boyd Brown recently discovered a 2003 state law that exempts ALEC from registering or disclosing its lobbying expenditures. One of the South Carolina bill\u2019s sponsors was ALEC member Rep. James Harrison, a Republican from Richland County.\nThe state\u2019s lobbying law prohibits lobbyists from paying a legislator more than $400 a year for lodging, transportation, entertainment, or food. At its task force meetings, ALEC covers two nights in a hotel and reimburses lawmakers for travel expenses up to $350. It also draws on corporate money to fund scholarships for legislators\u2019 conference registration expenses, which range from $150 to $500.\nIn Colorado, the late state Rep. Thomas Ratterree successfully introduced a bill in 1991 to amend ethics laws to exempt ALEC from lobbyist status. As a result, for legislators who attend ALEC events, \u201cthe expenses of such members for travel, board, and lodging related to such attendance [at ALEC events] may be paid from appropriations,\u201d the law reads. The law also stipulates that if taxpayers are to foot the bill, then delegations to ALEC events \u201cshall reflect equally the percentage of members from each party of the General Assembly.\u201d All 18 of the state\u2018s ALEC members, however, are Republicans. Only a tiny fraction of ALEC\u2019s 2,000 legislative members are not in the GOP, though the organization insists it is bipartisan.\nUnlike the South Carolina law, the Colorado and Indiana statutes exempt several groups, not just ALEC. In Colorado, three other groups, including the Council of State Governments and the National Conference of State Legislators, are exempt. In Indiana, five other groups are expressly \u201cnot considered lobbyists\u201d: the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, Women in Government, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators, the Council of State Governments, and the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nBut Julia Vaughn, director and lobbyist for Common Cause\u2019s affiliate in Indiana, says any challenge to ALEC\u2019s exemption would die quickly in the state\u2019s heavily Republican legislature.\nAs corporations continue to drop their membership, ALEC\u2019s representatives claim it has been unfairly singled out by a left-wing \u201cintimidation\u201d campaign,\u201d arguing that the organization provides an educational, nonpartisan resource for often understaffed state officials\u2014much like another exempt organization, the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nThe Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures is a research and advocacy group that pools the resources of state legislators nationwide. Every state legislator is a member, making the group \u201cas bipartisan as possible,\u201d says Jon Kuhl, an analyst for NCSL. \u201cOur president rotates every year between the parties.\u201d NCSL also endorses laws, but they face a high bar for its seal of approval: Legislators from across the political spectrum must pass them by a two-thirds majority. When NCSL does promote a law, it is usually something that members across party lines can agree on, like battling unfunded federal mandates.\nBoth organizations take corporate donations, but only in ALEC do corporations have voting rights. Alongside state legislators, representatives of corporate members propose and vote on the laws they want to see passed at the state level. Documents released this month by Common Cause show an overwhelming number of ALEC model bills get approved unanimously by task forces comprised of private- and public-sector members.\nALEC\u2019s model laws and membership lists are kept private; NCSL\u2019s endorsed laws are available online. These distinctions have led Common Cause affiliates to demand that state attorneys general review and revoke ALEC\u2019s nonprofit charity status.\nPressure from Common Cause and Color of Change have prompted 14 of ALEC\u2019s corporate members, including Coca-Cola, McDonald\u2019s, and Procter & Gamble, to drop out of the group. Thirty-four legislators have also quit. ALEC has announced it would shelve the task force that approved controversial voter identification laws and \u201cstand your ground\u201d gun laws.\nALEC meetings have been conducted mostly behind the scenes for decades, but its conference later this week in Charlotte, North Carolina, will likely draw more attention. Among the documents recently released (PDF) by Common Cause is a schedule and agenda for the get-together. ALEC member think tanks from Michigan and Arizona will sponsor a slew of controversial model bills aimed at public-sector unions. One would make it easier for public employees to call an election to decertify their union, and another would make it more difficult for unions to deduct dues from member paychecks.\n\u201cALEC spends a lot of time encouraging passage of laws, and everyone has a right to do that,\u201d Common Cause\u2019s Vaughn says, \u201cbut they should have to disclose how much they spend doing it, just like us and the Chamber [of Commerce] and the AFL-CIO.\u201d Common Cause spent $190,000 last year as a registered federal lobbyist for campaign finance reform and President Obama\u2019s jobs bill. Its Indiana affiliate spent almost $11,000 on lobbying in 2011, according to its public filing with the state.", "Syrian Regime Continues Massive Assault On Aleppo's Rebel Areas The Syrian government and Russian air force are pounding Aleppo's rebel areas, while rebel fighters battle back. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are in the middle of an intensifying humanitarian disaster.\nThe Syrian government and Russian air force are pounding Aleppo's rebel areas, while rebel fighters battle back. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are in the middle of an intensifying humanitarian disaster.\nIn Syria, conditions for hundreds of thousands of people are increasingly dire as the Syrian government and its allies continue a massive assault on rebel-held areas of the city of Aleppo. Aleppo has been a divided city for years, and rebels are well-entrenched in the city's eastern neighborhoods. But there are estimates that more than 200,000 civilians remain there as well.\nThis latest offensive including Syrian and Russian airstrikes comes after a failed attempt at a cease-fire earlier this month. NPR's Alice Fordham joins us now from Beirut. And Alice, what's the latest on how intense the fighting has been?\nALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: It has been intense. Earlier today there was a slight lull in this aerial assault. People said they were using that time to dig through the rubble of bombed buildings to recover victims. It is hard to get an exact death toll for this last week or so of fighting - the weekend, the United Nations said more than 200 people. A local opposition official told us more than 400 people. Those won't all be civilians, but many of them are. But in the chaos, it's hard to count because buildings are hit, and it's too dangerous to try to rescue people or recover bodies.\nNow, what we are seeing is significant ground fighting. Many people on the opposition side say they fear this is a concerted effort by the forces of Bashar al-Assad to move in decisively and take eastern Aleppo, take the areas that the rebel forces are holding. There's fighting around the citadel right in the middle of the city, and there's fighting in crucial supply routes around the edges. We're seeing back and forth, not decisive advances one way or the other at the moment.\nSIEGEL: Now, NPR has spoken to people in Aleppo. What do they say conditions are like in the city?\nSIEGEL: Yeah, terrible. I mean it's tough to talk to these people. They say this is the worst week in years of fighting there. I spoke to the mother of young children today who said the building next door to theirs was hit, and they were running out of food she'd stored up.\nWe also spoke to the head of the local council who said that rescue volunteers can't work. Most of them are out of commission. They say that their offices have been targeted in these airstrikes, that vehicles are destroyed. The Red Cross released a statement saying that hospitals are overflowing, very few doctors, no blood for blood transfusions, no supplies. The World Health Organization called for urgent medical evacuations. But those need permission from the regime, and the regime has a history of not giving those.\nAnd lots of elements of life have just stopped like schools, which are usually underground in basements. But now that people say the missiles are bigger, even basements are being destroyed.\nSIEGEL: Are there any prospects for things calming down in Aleppo?\nFORDHAM: No, not on the military side and not in terms of humanitarian aid or evacuations. Part of the reason for that is that the humanitarian side of things is tied closely with the political. And there's some progress on talks between the two sides and their allies. Sometimes we see things like aid convoys working, but right now those talks are at a standstill.\nSIEGEL: NPR's Alice Fordham in Beirut, thanks for talking with us.", "COLUMBUS \u2014 A national group that helped legalize marijuana in Colorado has set its sights on legalizing medical marijuana this fall in Ohio.\nStaff with the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that pushed marijuana laws in several states, think they can learn from ResponsibleOhio's failed $20 million campaign to legalize medical and recreational marijuana last fall. Nearly 64 percent of voters opposed the ballot initiative despite an expensive effort from marijuana farm investors.\n\"It\u2019s quite clear that voters do not support anything that could be perceived as a monopoly or oligopoly,\" Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Mason Tvert said. In November, Ohio voters also approved a proposal from lawmakers to ban monopolies in the state constitution, a thinly veiled attack on marijuana investors.\nMarijuana Policy Project did not invest in ResponsibleOhio's effort to legalize marijuana in Ohio, but the national group didn't oppose it either. Still, the Marijuana Policy Project wants to distance itself from the failed marijuana campaign. Marijuana Policy Project won't be working with ResponsibleOhio leader Ian James or his political consulting group, Tvert said.\nIn fact, Marijuana Policy Project is working with a group that co-managed the campaign to defeat marijuana legalization in 2015, Columbus-based Strategic Public Partners.\nSo, don't expect another marijuana mascot like Buddie 2.0.\nThe national group's proposal would allow patients with serious medical conditions to purchase marijuana from stores or grow their own at home if their physicians approve medical marijuana as a treatment option. Ohio would issue licenses for businesses to grow and sell medical marijuana to patients with state-issued identification cards, according to the Marijuana Policy Project's website.\nThe group is hiring an Ohio organizer for its campaign to pass a constitutional amendment on medical marijuana this November. The move comes after former members of ResponsibleOhio said the group wouldn't try again in 2016.\nOhio voters, at least in polls, seem much more interested in legalizing medical marijuana than the recreational drug. An October poll showed 90 percent of Ohioans supported legalizing marijuana for medical purposes. That was significantly higher than the percentage of Ohioans ready to legalize marijuana for personal use: 53 percent.\nLawmakers, motivated in part by concerns about another ballot initiative from marijuana investors, are talking more about the medical benefits and risks of marijuana. ResponsibleOhio co-founder Jimmy Gould and Chris Stock, author of the failed ballot initiative, recently joined a task force run by House lawmakers.

Department officials said nearly all of them had since been stripped from the rolls.\nAn additional 8,474 people were enrolled in Medicaid even though the Louisiana Department of Revenue later found that they had reported incomes of $50,000 to $100,000 on their 2017 tax returns.\nJen Steele, the state Medicaid director, said that 3,550 of those people are no longer enrolled, and 540 have supplied wage data supporting their current eligibility. She said the other 4,384 cases remain under review.\nThe data about these cases came to light at a House Appropriations Committee hearing as Republican legislators renewed their attacks on how the administration of Gov. John Bel Edwards has managed the program.\nEdwards, a Democrat who is running for re-election this year, has cited his support for the basic Medicaid program and his expansion of it to include nearly 500,000 residents making more than poverty-level wages as among his most significant achievements.\nRepublicans have questioned the cost of the expansion, and state auditors have said the program had been managed too loosely. The Health Department has since beefed up computer systems to check eligibility and recently kicked 30,000 people off the rolls.\nRep. Rick Edmonds, R-Baton Rouge, and Rep. Tony Bacala, R-Prairieville, led the questioning of health department officials about what they saw as lax controls.\n\u201cMedicaid is the number one issue,\u201d Edmonds said.\nBut Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas, noted that the expansion also had prevented rural hospital closures, eliminated waiting lists for people with developmental disabilities and increased availability to affordable Hepatitis C treatment.\nThe lengthy hearing opened with a plea by Marketa Walters, the secretary of the Department of Child and Family Services, for the committee to fund its $13 million budget shortfall.\nA crippling case load, increasing costs for technology to manage and store cases, and an earlier reduction of 500 employees all weigh heavily on the department, she said.\nHer comments came as the committee discussed a budget proposed by its chairman, Rep. Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and backed by House Speaker Taylor Barras, R-New Iberia.\nThe committee is working on a budget under the assumption that state revenue experts will not recognize a surplus in state revenue. Gov. Edwards has said that the additional revenue should be recognized and that it would be enough to continue funding the SNAP program.\nWhile the majority of the funding for child and family services comes from federal dollars, the department said it has made efforts to bring in additional funding through public and private partnerships.\nThe Wendy\u2019s Wonderful Kids initiative, for instance, has supported the state with $1 million. Walters said her department is actively looking for similar partnerships.\nShe said the state used to handle child abuse investigations, which are now funded through a federal program.", "The Chautauqua County Parks Commission will meet on Thursday at the Robert H.

So that's exactly what I did.\"\nThe gunman, who was near the dugout on the third baseline when he opened fire, wounded Rep. Steve Scalise, the majority whip in the House, and several others, including a congressional staffer and two law enforcement officers who were providing security at the field, officials said.\nThe gunman was wounded when police returned fire, and he later died. He has been identified as James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., about 80 miles south of where Davis lives.\n\"It makes me nauseous,\" said Davis, adding that he learned the gunman was from Illinois during a media interview.\nDavis, 47, is in his third term and has played baseball for the GOP congressional team \u2014 he is the catcher \u2014 throughout his tenure.\nHe said there were children milling around the playing field and people out walking their dogs when the quiet morning in Alexandria, Va., was disrupted by gunfire.\n\"I never thought I'd go to a baseball practice for a charity game, where Republicans and Democrats come together, and have to dodge bullets,\" Davis said.\nIn an earlier interview with CNN, Davis said he dove into the first baseline dugout along with other players. \"By the time I got there from home plate, I was on top of a couple people \u2014 didn't think that was the best place to be \u2026 an open dugout, so I tried to get out of there.\n\"When there seemed to be a break in activity, I and others, we dispersed up into the street,\" taking cover behind cars, Davis said.\nHe said someone called out that the gunman was coming up the street. \"A good Samaritan let us into his apartment so we could call 911,\" Davis said. \"I also called my family.\"\n\"It's my breaking point, we have to stop this,\" he said.\nU.S. Reps. John Shimkus and Darin LaHood of Illinois are on the GOP team's roster but were not at the practice, their offices said.\nIn the CNN interview, Davis blamed the shooting on the \"hateful\" tone of politics in the country and said it \"could be the first political rhetorical terrorist act.\"\n\"I believe there is such a hatefulness in what we see in American politics and policy discussions right now \u2026 on social media and the 24-hour news cycle. This has got to stop.\n\"We can disagree on how to govern \u2014 that's what makes this country great,\" he said. \"I think Republicans and Democrats need to use this day today to stand together and say, 'Stop, let's work together, let's get things done. We can have our differences, but let's not let it lead to such hate.'\"\nThe lawmaker told the Tribune he has seen social media posts attributed to the gunman, and \"he didn't look like he was too keen on Republican policies.\"\nU.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Channahon in Will County, who has played on the GOP baseball team in the past, joined Davis and other lawmakers in lamenting the ugly tone of today's politics. A look at the congressman's Facebook page will show that things have gotten \"so personal and so angry,\" he said during an afternoon conference call with reporters.\nKinzinger said that there has been an increasing number of death threats against him and other lawmakers, and that the frequency of death threats was \"overwhelming\" the Capitol Police.\nHe said lawmakers needed to join hands and realize that as political debates ensue, \"we can do it without \u2026 violence, extreme hate and anger.\"\nWhen congressional leaders announced Wednesday, during a closed-door briefing, that Thursday night's Republicans versus Democrats game would go on, there was a standing ovation, Kinzinger said. Going on to play the game \"sends a very strong and powerful message,\" he said.\nDuring the closed-door briefing, there were a \"lotta tears shed,\" Kinzinger said.\n\"All of us are really shaken by this,\" U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, an Evanston Democrat, said as she left the closed-door meeting.\n\"There was an incredible tone of unity,\" she said. \"And all of us need to take responsibility for the tone and for the fact that we are one, in terms of our love for our country and our vulnerability.\n\"And we need to stand together as Democrats and Republicans,\" she added.\nSecurity in and around the Capitol was ratcheted up after the mass shooting in nearby Alexandria. Schakowsky said Capitol Police and the House sergeant-at-arms indicated enhanced protective measures will be taken on Capitol Hill as well as at Thursday's congressional ballgame and next week's congressional picnic at the White House.\nU.S. Rep. Cheri Bustos, a Democrat from Moline who plays shortstop on a women's congressional softball team, lamented that the mass shooting targeted a rare bipartisan extracurricular activity.\n\"This is one of the few things that we have in Washington, D.C., where we build camaraderie,\" she said. \"And it's designed to help charitable causes, give us a release, come together with our colleagues and have fun. And now you've got a lunatic who is making the decision to come out and shoot five people and is disrupting something that actually is good in Washington, D.C.\"\nDavis, in his Tribune interview, said he was heartened that the congressional baseball game at Nationals Park would be played.\n\"Obviously security is going to be enhanced after a tragedy like today, but I'm glad the game is going on,\" he said.\n\"This is our chance to remind everyone in this country that we're Americans. Republicans and Democrats get along out here. We actually govern together on most issues we deal with, but the political rhetoric that we've seen come out of the news media and out of the social media, this has got to stop.\"\nThe game will be played to \"send a message to all those who hate that enough is enough,\" Davis said.\nDavis also said he hoped good would emerge from the violence.\n\"Let this day be our day,\" he said, \"where we come together as a country and stop this political, rhetorical hate speech that we see on all sides, in the media and in social media.\"", "I dislike such things not because they are new, but because they are irresponsible exploitations of technique in contradiction of human life as we know it. This is my essential criticism of modernism, whether perpetrated by Parker, Pound, or Picasso: it helps us neither to enjoy nor endure.

Greg Abbott to oversee TxDOT \u2014 released the agenda for its April 26 meeting in Austin late Wednesday. And LBJ East wasn't on it.\n\"Everyone in the room knows the right thing to do on this project,\" said RTC and Dallas City Council member Adam McGough, who has worked to gather support for the managed lanes. \"The issue is we don't want to make someone mad.\"\nWith state commissioners' omission of the project, regional transportation staff recommended an alternative \u2014 to toll only the one express lane in each direction that is currently tolled. The council, instead, took no action and asked for clarification as to whether the TTC directive is for TxDOT not to be involved in the tolled lanes or, instead, for LBJ East to not have tolled lanes at all.\nTTC Chairman J. Bruce Bugg told the House Transportation Committee on Wednesday that the commission is focused on the Texas Clear Lanes Program, which advocates non-tolled projects for the state's major metropolitan areas where two-thirds of Texans live.\n\"In conversations with the chairman, I think he's been very consistent about his sentiment,\" TxDOT Dallas district engineer Kelly Selman told the RTC on Thursday. \"It's not being negative toward the region. It's statewide policy. This is the way we're going to go.\"\nState Sen. Don Huffines said that people he represents in North Dallas are being hammered with traffic problems and that local leaders are to blame.\n\"The RTC is arrogantly ignoring the will of not just Gov. Greg Abbott and the conservative Texas Legislature, they're ignoring the voices of hundreds of thousands of Dallas County voters who \u2014 on three occasions \u2014 have voted against toll roads or at least to place additional limitations on them,\" Huffines said Thursday in a prepared statement.\nMcGough; Arturo Ballesteros, government affairs director of the North Texas Tollway Authority; and Dallas City Council member Lee Kleinman also spoke to the House Transportation Committee. Kleinman called LBJ East a poster child for projects across the state.\n\"The region leveraged $7 billion of state funding into $21 billion of projects for the region,\" Kleinman told legislators. \"We also used federal money, local money, private money \u2014 every place we could find financing, we're using it. We need it. So I'm back to my plea of all the tools in the toolbox. Everything.\"\nBut on Thursday, in asking to table the new resolution with its single tolled lane in each direction, Kleinman told the RTC that Bugg's message was clear. \"I just don't think we can keep sending him something that's against his request.\"\nIn the meantime, RTC chairman and Cedar Hill Mayor Rob Franke has invited state officials to see the problem for themselves \u2014 and experience the difference the managed lanes make on the completed segment of I-635 west of Central Expressway.\nDallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said he has also invited state leaders to tour the area. Garland Mayor Douglas Athas said he and Mesquite Mayor Stan Pickett, whose residents face the daily impasse, would be willing to drive.", "The University of Sydney plans to increase its undergraduate courses from three to four years and cut many of its double degrees in a radical overhaul of education that would see the number of degrees reduced by at least 100.\nAs part of a determined bid to topple Melbourne University from the coveted position as Australia's top university, Sydney has embarked on a major rethink of its structure and culture, starting with a significant reduction in the number of undergraduate degrees it offers from 122 to about 20.\nMelbourne offers as few as six undergraduate degrees while the University of Western Australia offers fewer than 10.\nThe vice-chancellor, Michael Spence, has said the university will also rethink its research investments and face up to a cultural bias of \"old, white males\" in positions of power.\nA discussion paper, released to staff on Monday, says Sydney needs to adapt and prepare its students for the \"rapidly changing world\".\nThe university's deputy vice-chancellor (education), Pip Pattison, said the discussion paper listed qualities that were crucial for Sydney students, including critical thinking, problem solving and teamwork but also \"the personal resilience to deal with uncertainty and failure\".\n\"The rationale for the four-year degree is we want our students to acquire all of those qualities and we think that would take four years,\" she said.\nThe discussion paper said many universities and higher education systems have already settled on four-year liberal studies degrees.\n\"They are common, for example, in North America and parts of East Asia and South America, and four-year degrees offering breadth through languages or industry experience are common in the UK,\" the paper says.\nProfessor Pattison said it was only a \"relatively small fraction\" of students who left the university after their three-year degree, with most staying on for further study so the change to a four-year degree would \"not be as radical as you may think\".\n\"We would embed honours within the fourth year but you wouldn't necessarily need to do honours in the fourth year because you could do a mixture of project work in an applied field plus get professional skills for the workplace,\" Professor Pattison said.\nShe said there would also be a significant move away from double degrees, which were very common at Sydney.\n\"We would be reducing the number of double undergraduate degrees but replacing those with double vertical degrees, so a bachelor plus masters combination and that would be specifically where one of the degrees is in a professional field,\" Professor Pattison said.\n\"An example of that would instead of doing a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of education, you might do a bachelor of arts and a master of teaching, so you do the teaching qualification at the master level.\"\nThe university will release a series of discussion papers over the next six months.", "In a world where stories of hackers stealing passwords and crashing websites are more and more common, it\u2019s refreshing to hear that there are a few more civically minded hackers out there.

Sophisticated text messaging capabilities, from math tutors to health care, are becoming near ubiquitous in some developing countries, so an SMS program should be easily implementable during the next disaster.\nHey Cycle is an email alert system for the popular neighborhood stuff exchange network, Freecycle, which is like Craigslist for free lending and borrowing. Without an alert system, users are forced into a frustrating eBay-like stalking of the website for wish-listed items. More sophisticated sharing platforms, such as NeighborGoods, already have this alert capability, but aren\u2019t nearly as geographically diverse as Freecycle.\nAnyone who has ever worked in a restaurant or grocery story has witnessed the mountains of edible food that gets tossed out every day.

The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\nOprah raised a number of sensitive topics for the president during the roundtable with 14 Michigan voters, which was a follow-up to a similar roundtable held last fall.\nThe talk show host brought up the sexual harassment allegations against the president, as well as questions about his fitness for office and the \u201cshithole\u201d comment he reportedly made about African countries.\n\u201cThere have been some members of Congress, including Republicans, questioning his stability and fitness for office. What do you think of that, and do you believe he has the temperament to be president?\u201d Oprah asked.\nShe also brought up the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that emerged during the 2016 campaign, revealing Trump making lewd comments about his behavior towards women.\n\u201cOne person who hasn\u2019t been touched by the [#MeToo] movement is the president himself.

Gen. James Hecker, commander of coalition air forces in Afghanistan.\n\"We never take anything off the table,\" Hecker told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday. \"Right now, we don't have a use for it, but if we do, it's there for us.\"\nThe bomb was rapidly designed and built between November 2002 and March 2003, ahead of the initial invasion of Iraq. It was designed to be a replacement for the massive BLU-82 \"Daisy Cutter,\" according to the Air Force. When it was first tested on March 11, 2003, the explosion created a mushroom cloud that could be seen from 20 miles away.\nBy the time the MOAB arrived in theater, coalition forces were close to Baghdad. It would be 14 years before the weapon would make its debut when it was dropped in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province following the death of a Special Forces soldier fighting ISIS-Khorasan.\nDamage from the \"MOAB\" blast in northeast Afghanistan, April 2017.\nNews that the bomb had finally been used created a media sensation that made Hecker's mother concerned about him.\n\"Quite honestly, after only being here a week and my mom heard that a MOAB was dropped, she immediately sent me a note and asked if I was OK,\" Hecker said at Wednesday's news conference. \"I let her know that we won't drop on ourselves. This is meant for the enemy.\"\nWith ISIS fighters going underground in Iraq and Syria, US Central Command has made Afghanistan the priority for air operations.\nISIS-K defensive fighting positions hit by airstrikes in Momand Valley, Achin District, Nangahar Province, Afghanistan, October 19, 2017.\nUS forces in Afghanistan now have 50% more MQ-9 Reaper drones to find targets, as well as an A-10 squadron to provide close air support, Hecker said. A combat search and rescue squadron is also being deployed to the country.\nOn Feb. 4, a B-52 dropped a total of 24 precision-guided bombs \u2014 a new record \u2014 during three airstrikes against Taliban and East Turkestan Islamic Movement training camps in northeast Afghanistan, Hecker said. Previously, B-52s only had room for 16 precision-guided bombs, but in late November, the bomber was modified for an increased payload at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.\nMeanwhile, the Afghan air force is dropping or launching weapons at the enemy at nearly double the rate of US aircraft, Hecker said. However, he clarified, most of those strikes come from the Afghan fleet of 25 MD-530 helicopters, which are equipped with laser-guided rockets and machine guns.\nHecker conceded that strikes from a light attack helicopter and a B-52 don't exactly make for an apples-to-apples comparison. \"But I wouldn't say it's apples to oranges either,\" he said.\n\"If you're on the other side of that rocket and you're a Taliban, you probably don't care if it's a rocket or if it's a [precision-guided munition] that's hitting you in the forehead,\" Hecker said.", "Therapy Soup readers know that we believe body, mind and soul are intricately linked and that a holistic approach to treatment for mental illness and/or addiction (or any health or personality issue) is truly necessary.\nWe\u2019ve posted quite a few articles on the importance of nutrition in the treatment of mental health issues (most recently, this piece on Martha Herbert\u2019s revolutionary whole-body treatment approach for autism). Now we\u2019d like to tell you about a nutritional approach for the treatment of anxiety.\nTrudy Scott has had her own personal journey with anxiety, starting in her mid-thirties. She says, \u201cMy anxiety was just awful and I had feelings of doom for no reason, a pounding heart in the middle of the night and at various times during the day, excessive unfounded worry and feelings of being overwhelmed, avoidance of social situations, panic attacks (I had three in total and would not wish one on my worst enemy) and one throat constriction episode.\nShe also consults with individual women who need individualized advice about how to address their own nutrition needs (you can learn more at her one-on-one consulting site, everywomanover29.) Trudy is knowledgeable about both diet and supplements but what really shines in the \u201cAntianxiety Food Solution\u201d is an approach that is personally tailored to your specific needs.\nThe book contains simple tests you can take to determine if you have any food intolerances or allergies which may be not only triggering anxiety symptoms but also wreaking havoc on your digestion (remember the brain-gut connection we\u2019ve blogged about here in reference to schizophrenia, here and here in reference to autism and serotonin).\nAlthough some mental health professionals believe there isn\u2019t proof of the link between behavior, mental health and diet, today most current research shows there is definitely a very important correlation if not an outright causal relationship.\nThink about it: If you\u2019ve ever slammed down some coffee or a caffeinated (and heavily sugared) drink to \u201cget you going\u201d you know that your pulse, heart rate and overall energy levels get a \u201crush.\u201d That rush, which over time will weaken the adrenal glands, can also be experienced as anxiety. But the book goes far deeper. It explores the relationship between the bodily levels of important chemicals such as serotonin, GABA, and endorphins and diet and offers suggestions on how to increase your production of these feel-good chemicals.\nThe book\u2019s dietary suggestions largely stress a non-vegetarian diet, which many people today, especially women, seem to have an aversion to. As a former vegetarian (and former vegan), like Trudy, I\u2019ve found that eating organic, minimally produced animal foods along with a mixture of good fats, living/raw and cooked vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, and seeds seems to give me the most energy and feeling of well-being.\nThough I eat far smaller amounts of animal foods than she recommends, I have been moving towards a similar approach (in part based on some recommendations of the Weston Price Foundation) to try to help with stress and burn-out.\nIn order to review the book, I took all the tests inside and I\u2019m glad I did. I learned that taking B6 and GABA might be a good choice to help me feel less stressed and burned out and that taking tryptophan or 5-HTP might be a good choice to help me get to sleep at a reasonable hour (I\u2019m both a night-owl and an early-bird and rarely get enough sleep, even when exhausted I find it challenging to get to bed before 1:00 AM).\nI especially like that the author has referenced all her information so you can see for yourself why she makes the recommendations she does.

Why did Israel find it necessary to board the flotilla ships while it was dark? Why was it necessary to do it in international waters? Why couldn\u2019t they have waited till daylight and until the ships were in territorial waters where Israel might have had at least some plausible justification for intervening? And why was it necessary to stage a \u201craid\u201d rather than a traditional \u201cshot across the bow\u201d and an order to halt or face consequences, followed by boarding and inspection? Never mind the collective punishment being inflicted on the people (and CHILDREN!) of Gaza.\nThese ships were unarmed. Quite frankly, I sympathize with the people of the flotilla and wish I had been among them. And, had I been there, I can only hope that I\u2019d have had the courage to stand up to the invaders.\nHere\u2019s something else I\u2019d like to know. Israel\u2019s vastly superior military easily allows them to put a stranglehold on Gaza. It\u2019s no contest. But how have they managed to strangle the U.S. media as well?\nLastly, a \u201ccoincidence\u201d that I think needs looking into: Israel is said to be the U.S.\u2019s closest ally; Israel has lots of enemies; so, we are told, does the U.S. Any correlation there?\nThe whole affair stinks and you know it. If you can\u2019t speak truth to power, get out of the business.\nI watched the segment on Bloomberg suit against the FED to disclose which banks are receiving part of the $13 Trillion of taxpayer money. I work in finance and read a lot. I try to connect the dots, the links between stories that are tied together. I built a new home, to downsize from a property that was and is being taxed at the high bubble level. I could not stay in the home, the taxes are nearly as much as my pension from a Fortune 500 Company of 30 years (half of pension stolen in the 90\u2032s). Unfortunately, I had not sold the old overtaxed home before I elected to build the new retirement home. Starting in the Spring of 2007, we built the home and it was complete in May 2008. The Construction completion loan was about $60,000 less than what it cost for me to build, the appraisal was used to finance the loan, with the idea of the loan only being temporary and we put the old home up for sale immediately. As I right this, the old home has not sold, I tried to refinance the new home with the lower interest rate and the value of the home, appraisal wise, the second in 12 months, dropped 38% in 12 months and I cold not take advantage of the lower interest rates. Basically, from what the new home cost to build, not a mansion, the value dropped 50% in 12 months. The cost per square foot went from $125 a square foot to $70 a square foot, about the same as a manufactured mobil home. I tried to take advantage of the Home Affordable Modification Program, HAMP part of TARP. I sent an inquiry to Wells Fargo, the servicer of my Fannie Mae loan, and received a \u201cforebearance offer\u201d that halved the mortgage payment for six months, on the seventh month the six months of short payments (half the mortgage) was due in a lump sum along with a expense and charges equal to a full month of mortgage payment, a 33% interest rate. Ie, say $2000 was my mortgage monthly payment, the \u201cforebearance\u201d was $1000 a month for six months, the seventh month, $10,000 was due in a lump sum, $6000 from the deferred mortgage payment, $2000 for the seventh month and $2000 in charges and interest. Wells Fargo used a very deceptive way of presenting the forebearance, the amounts were odd numbers, for example, a mortgage payment is not even numbers, ie $2458.64 and the forebearance amount would be $1226.32 for six months, and the lump sum due would be $12,275.20 multiples of the normal monthly mortgage payment. I thought, what kind of HAMP Federal program is this. The two page forebearance document had no disclosure of the amount of charges and very strong words \u201cOne day late, we start foreclosure\u201d. I called Wells Fargo, I asked what kind of Federal HAMP program charges 33% interest, immediately, the Wells Fargo rep said \u201cOh, this is a Wells Fargo program, if you don\u2019t like it, send it back. I kept it and thought to myself, there must be a better way to take advantage of the lower interest rates less than 5%.\nI applied for a mortgage loan with another company, not trusting Wells Fargo. An Appraisal was ordered, and came in 33% lower than the appraisal of just 12 months earlier. The \u2018New rules\u201d of appraisals, driven by the banks, would not allow me to talk to the appraiser. I thought, how could the value of a new home, I built mainly from Home Depot and authorized and scrutinized every payment drop 33% in 12 months? I was locked out of re-financing. Wells Fargo continued to call me, wanting me to enter a HAMP agreement. I put them off for 4 months, until after the refinance effort fell through with the other company because of \u201cnew appraisal rules\u201d. I answered the phone and the Well Fargo rep, said I had already qualified for the HAMP trial period (I was making full payments), and it would be just a quick qualification if I would send in my tax returns, w2\u2032s, payroll stubs, and assets like 401K\u2019s and savings. I sent the information in November 1st. I called toward the end of November for an update, the Loss Mitigation department at Wells Fargo told me they had my application along with all my finanical information including copies of my 1040 tax return, and my case had been assigned a \u201cnegotiator\u201d who would review my case and it would take 45 to 60 working days before I would be notified. I called back in December, talked to the Loss MItigation department and still the same response, \u201cyour case has been assigned a Negotiator\u201d. They also gave me another number that I called, it was NOT the loss Mitigation department. The lady looked at my account and told me \u201cYou have been declined HAMP\u201d. I asked why and she did not have the reason. So I called back to the Loss MItigation department, asked if my case was still active. They told me yes that the negotiator is still working on my case for HAMP. I called again for an update in January, they advised me that they were \u201crecording my call\u201d and I said OK I am to (recording). The Wells Fargo rep said \u201cIf you are recording this call, I cannot talk to you and hung up. \u201cI was on my cell phone, had no way of recording the call driving. I called back again and when they said they were recording the call, I said I am to, they again said that they could not talk to me, if I was recording the call, I asked why can they record and I can\u2019t, they hung up.\nIn January, I called again, told me that the negotiator was still working on my case, 45 to 60 days and that I needed to send in the w2\u2032s, paystubs and my financial information immediately or the case would be dismissed. I Faxed and Sent overnight all the financial information and called them and they confirmed that I was still in the loop. I was crusing the internet and read all the horror stories of Wells Fargo and other banks who were jerking aroung HAMP applicants. I called in February, assured by Wells Fargo, the negotiator would notify me in the 45 to 60 period which was the first of March. Part of the HAMP procedure was sending in short payments, less than the full amount. I chose NOT to do that. I sent in the full mortgage payment. In March, I received my Wells Fargo statement, the payments in January and February, were \u201cNOT APPLIED\u201d to my mortgage. I called the loss mitigation department and asked why the mortgage had not been applied to my mortgage and sent to Fannie Mae. She had no answer. I asked where was the money deposited, Wells Fargo said in a \u201cCash Account\u201d. I asked what they were doing with my Mortgage payments? No answer. I had the experience with Wells Fargo where they raised the escrow amount and also did NOT APPLY my mortgage payment to my mortgage loan. So the HAMP trial period, automatically put the money in a cash account and Fannie Mae did not get paid and Wells Fargo was using my money to \u201cmake money\u201d. They assured that it did not affect my credit. When I obtained the credit report, there was OK on everything, EXCEPT the listing of Wells Fargo where is was blank or a special entry. Kind of a flag to lenders but the credit score was still excellent. A week later, I received the denial letter and my choices were Shortsale of In lieu of Deed I could turn over the new home to Wells Fargo. The reason, I had been turned down for HAMP because the new home was not my \u201cPrimary Residence\u201d even though we lived in it but had to commute 300 miles and were living in our old home, to work, and the old home was not selling. I did not see what the definition of a \u201cPrimary Residence\u201d in the HAMP documentation, and found it in the Internal Revenue Websites, where you bank, where you receive your paycheck. So, in November, based on my HAMP application, Wells Fargo declined my HAMP but did not tell me until March, four months later, asking for updated financial information and assuring me that my HAMP application was still active? Wells Fargo Lied to me.\nA few months later, I called Wells Fargo to see if I could take advantage of the 125% new rule and the Wells Fargo loan officer looked up my account, said you were short on your mortgage payment and cannot apply for the lower interest rate loans for 12 months. I told him that I did make full payments but he said, their Wells Fargo\u2019s system said I was short. I called the Loss Mitigation at Wells Fargo and they reviewed it and said, OH, we will correct that negative credit report, you did make full payment during the HAMP trial period. I am glad I did not send in their trial period as it would have prevented me from refinancing. So now I sit, waiting, hopefully, I will be able to lower my mortgage payment with a lower interest without lots of cost.\nOver the past 17 months, I have learned a lot. The HAMP program is a horrible program and 1.8 million people lost their homes in shortsales and foreclosures and one million the first quarter of 2010. Normally there are 100,000 foreclosures nationally, today ONE MILLION. The employee Assistance program to help working employees has employed people who have no place to live, their credit is shot, they have no place to live.\nWell, sorry about the length of this note, but I have put the dots together and we have a major crisis in housing, and the HAMP program facilitated by the banks are enabling people to lose their homes, not save them. I have written my Congressman and other Congressmen after watching the CSPAN Congressional hearing with the bankers on why, out of $75 Billion allocated for HAMP loans, only $300 million has been spent and One Million people have shortsaled or foreclosed. The banks were asked if they were losing money in foreclosures and making more money with a foreclosure than by helping people meet their mortgage payments. The six major bankers including Wells Fargo said they lose money in foreclosures. I think the bankers are lying through ommission, not telling the whole story during a shortsale where before the new owner takes over, the banks really make money, and lots of it via the FDIC loss guarantees. FDIC denies it but Wells Fargo in the first quarter made $2.1 Billion in profit while processing approximately 250,000 homes in shortsales and foreclosures. If they lose money, how can they make so much profit? In our community of 50,000, where lots of new homes were built over the last 10 years, we have about 13,000 homes, and 5,000 properties are in foreclosure and another 4000 are in pre-foreclosure. This include building lots. Since May of 2008, we have had no offers and the banks are not lending to buyers who want a large lot that could be subdivided.\nWhat is going on, is that we will not be able to sell our old home, unless we accept what our property was worth in 1980. The taxes have not lowered that much, about 10% with the mil levy having been increased 20% to cover the shortfalls in taxes.\nI am sending you links to various websites that support the fact that the banks are MAKING money by helping people lose their homes instead of helping them keep their homes.\nThe first one is a couple of men who disclose how the FDIC is paying the banks at 80% of the par value of the original loan that One West and other banks like Wells Fargo have taken over the mortgages of the failed banks and are getting checks from the tax payer supported FDIC (even though the banks contribute to the FDIC, they run to the FED if they run out of money). I have read somewhere, the FED has spent $1.3 Trillion but not sure where. The Bloomberg story adds validity to what One West and Wells Fargo are doing, making MONEY from shortsales and foreclosures.\nThe FDIC put out a press release disputing the \u201csweetheart deal\u201d with the banks who took over the mortgage assets of failed banks like One West and Wells Fargo and Bank of America.\nBy the way, the two guys you tube has had over 1.5 million hits and there is no evidence other than a dispute from the FDIC that is filled with \u201cgobblygook\u201d. Like my grandmother always said, \u201cFollow the Money: and you will get your answer. Wells Fargo is on the way to make more than $8 Billion in profit while putting homeowners at more risk with lies and deceit.\nI have written and called each Congressman that appeared in this video and told their staff to share the \u201cSweetheart One West\u201d deal.\nI have called all my Congressmen when I found out that HAMP according the the US Treasury is a deceptive program to shore up the banks assets, not to help homeowners. If true, we need to replace the Congress in mass.\nI got a call last week from my Congressman\u2019s office. They would like to talk to me. They did say \u201cThey did not have anything to do with HAMP\u201d . I really don\u2019t give a damn who created it, all I know is there are 4000 homes in a town of 50,000 in foreclosure TODAY. The foreclosures, the banks are hurting this economy, affects jobs, effects transfers, affects confidence of consumers, affects the Senior trying to downsize and move to a warmer climate, builders, and the economic well being.\nThe FDIC payments through the back door with guarantees to the banks as in the video is killing the taxpayer, who is paying for it, but cannot sell his home.\nFirst it was tax reform to get to home equity, the destruction of leadership training organizations the weakening of labor bargaining from 35 million members to 17 million, the theft of defined benefit pensions from 125,000 to less than 16,000 today mainly Unions and Federal, and now biggest attack by the USA financial organizations, the number one asset of the average amerian, the home and the equity it represents.\nSorry for the length of this note. I was a fan of Bill Moyers. I hope you will do something with this. Like all reporting, you can report something but it is not a requirement to offer a solution. In the case of the HAMP scam, a good intention program to help people save their homes, that has been bastardized by the servicing banks, is supporting the Plutocracy theory, that is real, and people are not aware of it, especially the cynical senior citizen and those who think that people who are losing their homes are deadbeats and deserve to lose their home.\nBut, when I ask the Senior if he has any plans to sell his 30 or 40 year old home and move to a warmer climate, and point out there are hundreds of homes in foreclosure, 2 to 10 years old, and he would have a dog a chance selling his old home unless he accepts $20 a square foot, he is no longer smiling much.\nThanks for what you do, hopefully you will do a story on the plight of the people who are losing their homes, the Bloomberg suit will be successful exposing the FDIC payments for shortsales and foreclosures via the taxpayer, to banks, who enable taxpayers to shortsale and foreclose.\nBy the way, 3 million foreclosures in 2009 and 2010 is probably about 12 million people while the banks like Wells Fargo are making $2.1 Billion a quarter.

It depends on who you ask.\nThe FDA has told the company to stop making \u201chealthy\u201d claims. Kind bars exceed the maximum 3 grams of fat (and 1 gram of saturated fat) that regulators allow for a food to be marketed with the term.\nBut the New York-based company won\u2019t let go of \u201chealthy\u201d without a fight. On December 1, it filed a petition saying that how the FDA defines \u201chealthy\u201d is all wrong, since the fat criteria exclude foods that contain nuts, avocados, olives, and salmon\u2013all foods that nutrition experts encourage people to eat precisely for their health benefits.\nBoth parties are right, and both are wrong.\nThe FDA\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d guidelines were created more than 20 years ago. They are outdated, and Kind is right to point out that they unfairly exclude these food items.\n\u201cThe current regulations were created with the best intentions when the available science supported dietary recommendations limiting total fat intake. However, current science tells us that unsaturated fats in nutrient-dense foods like nuts, seeds, and certain fish are beneficial to overall health,\u201d CEO Daniel Lubetzky said in a statement.\nHowever, Kind\u2019s petition, which has the signature of a number of nutritionists, doesn\u2019t emphasize the flip side of its argument, which is that the science has also advanced in understanding how bad sugar can be for a person\u2019s long-term health. The FDA\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d guidelines currently have no criteria for sugar or added sugar at all\u2013that\u2019s why sugary breakfast cereal or low-fat Pop Tarts can call themselves healthy. Truly healthy foods, like nuts, would also be low in sugar.\nSo Kind is right to raise the issue. But if the FDA were to truly do a science-based update on its definition \u201chealthy,\u201d it\u2019s still unclear where some of Kind\u2019s products would fall. The company announced recently it does plan to reduce added sugar on its higher-sugar Fruit & Nut line by 15%-50% starting this spring, and it does support the FDA\u2019s proposal to included a daily value for added sugar on nutritional food labels. But we\u2019re probably all better off just downing a handful of whole almonds and calling it a day.", "I\u2019m trying to do this every week, and though it\u2019s only the second week since I started, I nearly couldn\u2019t finish. Please try to read this whole thing. If you can\u2019t, or if you\u2019re annoyed, please remember that is the White House\u2019s whole strategy.\n1. Running update: Trump\u2019s promise of a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country\u201d is still on his campaign page. The court decision indicated Trump\u2019s tweets and previous statements could be used as evidence the \u201ctravel ban\u201d is indeed intended to target a religious group.\n2. Reuters reported that during Trump\u2019s unrecorded phone call with Putin, \u201cWhen Putin raised the possibility of extending the 2010 treaty, known as New START, Trump paused to ask his aides in an aside what the treaty was.\u201d Trump, upon knowing what Putin was talking about, denounced it as a bad Obama deal.

Unrelated: The top US military commander in Afghanistan testified that Russia was legitimizing the Taliban in order to undermine the US and NATO.\n5. Unrelated: Trump spontaneously tweeted \u201cI don\u2019t know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy. Yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!\u201d Trump isn\u2019t going \u201ctear up\u201d the Iran deal as promised, but hasn\u2019t offered any new ideas about it.\n6. The New York Times dropped a long piece at halftime during the Super Bowl with the harmless title, \u201cTrump and Staff Rethink Tactics After Stumbles.\u201d In it they reveal a White House collapsing on itself, Trump wandering the halls late at night in a bathrobe, calling advisers at all hours of the night, watching \u201ctoo much\u201d cable, and a whole lot of internal conflict. Must read.\n9. In response, Trump attacked Senator Blumenthal, saying he \u201cmisrepresented\u201d Gorsuch\u2019s remarks. He also brought up Blumenthal\u2019s misrepresentation (from 2010) of his Vietnam service and called the interview \u201cfake news\u201d because the interviewer, Chris Cuomo, didn\u2019t ask the Senator about Vietnam.\n11. But Gorsuch\u2019s remarks were confirmed on the record by a White House adviser who was assigned to work on the Gorsuch appointment.\n12. Senator Jeff Sessions, a racist, was confirmed as our next attorney general.\n13. The official @POTUS account re/tweeted about it fourteen times.\n14. During Sessions\u2019 confirmation, Senator Elizabeth Warren was formally silenced by Mitch McConnell for reading Corretta Scott King\u2019s statement about Sessions. The statement was part of the official congressional record.\n16. During his first speech in front of the military, Trump claimed terrorist attacks go \u201cunreported\u201d in the media.\n18. The White House then released a list of 78 of those \u201cunder-reported\u201d terrorist attacks. The New York Times defended its coverage, and PolitiFact found that only one of those 78 attacks didn\u2019t have media coverage\u2014and that attack (in Egypt; not one of Trump\u2019s seven banned countries) didn\u2019t kill anyone and has never been confirmed.\n19. The mother of a victim killed in one of the listed attacks posted a letter to Trump, saying her daughter\u2019s murder had \u201cno connection\u201d to terrorism. Australian police had ruled out terrorism too.\n20. The Washington Post, in a truly great piece of reporting, noted the list left out many horrific attacks where Muslims were killed.\n21. Trump\u2019s refugee ban was blocked by a federal appeals court.\n22. In a tweet, Trump told the court he\u2019d \u201cSEE [THEM] IN COURT.\u201d A comma splice made the tweet read as if President Trump were threatening someone named THE SECURITY OF THE NATION IS AT STAKE!\n24. Trump attacked John McCain again, calling him a loser in a tweet.\n27. Trump was sued for his \u201c2 for 1\u201d executive order about government regulations.\n28. Marine Le Pen, radical right-winger, the leading candidate for President of France, open admirer of Trump and and inspiration to the Quebec City mosque shooter backed Russia and its invasion of Crimea.\n29. European intelligence officials are afraid Russian state-backed hackers will try to help get Le Pen elected.\n30. Trump attacked Nordstrom in a tweet for treating Ivanka \u201cunfairly\u201d and pulling her brand off the shelves.\n31. It later was calculated that Trump composed this tweet about 20 minutes into his intelligence briefing.\n32. Sean Spicer defended the tweet.\n34. Spicer said Conway was \u201ccounseled\u201d for the ethics violation.\n35. Conway contradicted this and said Trump has her back.\n37. Nordstrom said the reason it pulled Ivanka\u2019s products was because they weren\u2019t selling and that it had actually told Ivanka about the decision a month ago.\n38. Ivanka promised she\u2019d divest from her brand as part of taking a job as an adviser to her father, but she still hasn\u2019t filed the paperwork.\n39. Phew. Done with that story.\n40. Gambling houses are offering nearly even money that Trump will be impeached. Trump has been President for three weeks.\n41. It was reported that Louvre attacker Abdullah Reda al-Hamahmy sympathized with the Islamic State but did not pledge allegiance to them or carry out the attack under the group\u2019s orders. He\u2019s from Egypt, which is not on Trump\u2019s list of seven banned countries. Trump had tweeted about the attack as justification for his travel ban.\n42. A poll of 10,000 people in 10 European countries revealed the majority of Europeans support Trump\u2019s travel ban. The biggest supporters are (surprise!) old, rural, and undereducated.\n43. Amnesty International reported that the Assad government secretly hanged 13,000 people in a Syrian prison. Trump tried to ban all Syrian refugees being terrorized by Assad from entering the US.\n45. #GOODNEWS: Subway riders in New York City found anti-semitic graffiti inside a car and broke out the Purel to scrub it clean. I had no idea most hate crimes in the US target Jews, despite the fact Jews make up only two percent of the population.\n46. The US House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology said (based on shaky evidence) that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \u201cmanipulated climate records.\u201d It\u2019s a disingenuous report.\n49. A poll revealed the Trump administration is more trusted than the media.\n51. Trump said he\u2019d be cool with privatizing the air traffic control system. He said the current system was \u201ctotally out of whack.\u201d Since 2009, the FAA has been developing a new multibillion-dollar air traffic control system (NextGen) and has already been rolling it out in stages. It\u2019s scheduled to be completed in 2025.\n52. The Iraqi Prime Minister, in his first phone call with DJ Trump, asked the President to lift the ban on Iraqis entering the US. Trump initiated the call.\n53. A new report said Trump\u2019s border wall will cost $21 billion to build. This is more expensive than funding NASA for a year.\n54. A Spanish paper \u201caccidentally\u201d printed a picture of Alec Baldwin impersonating Trump instead of Trump himself. The picture was next to a picture of Putin.\n55. Trump warned Iranian President Hassan Rouhani he \u201cbetter be careful.\u201d Trump was flying to Mar-a-Lago with the Japanese Prime Minister.\n56. Trump told a meeting of sheriffs and police chiefs that the crime rate is at a 47-year high. It\u2019s not.\n57. Trump dropped the government\u2019s defense of its policy ensuring transgender students have access to facilities that correspond with their gender identity.\n58. Parts of the infamous \u201cGolden Memo\u201d (the dossier of Trump\u2019s collaboration with Putin to undermine the US election) have been corroborated. The dossier is gaining more credibility with law enforcement officials.\n59. For the record: I bet a great deal of the dossier is accurate and that Trump did in fact commit treason.\n60. DJ Trump told a meeting of Senate Democrats that \u201cPocahontas is now the face of your party.\u201d Trump calls Senator Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d because he doubts her claims that she\u2019s part Native American, saying she only has high cheekbones. In the same meeting Trump restated his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud during the election.\n61. ICE began deporting undocumented immigrants who\u2019ve committed crimes. Democrats say many arrested in the raids, taking place across the country, haven\u2019t committed any crimes.\n63. A legal permanent resident living in Texas, Rosa Ortega, was sentenced to eight years in prison (!!!) for voting illegally. Ortega had a green card and thought that entitled her to vote. She was a registered Republican who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and then for Ken Paxton for Texas Attorney General in 2014. Paxton won that election and was the prosecutor who gave Ortega eight years. Ortega didn\u2019t vote in the 2016 election.\n65. Trump has expressed displeasure with his national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, who was outed last week for discussing US sanctions with the Russian ambassador a month before Trump was inaugurated. For over a month Flynn denied he had spoken about the sanctions in the call, and Vice President Michael Pence backed his story. The call with the ambassador came on the same day Obama announced the sanctions and three days after a former KGB-chief linked to the Golden Memo was found dead in the back of his car.\n67. While Trump was having dinner with Abe at Mar-a-Lago, North Korea carried out an intermediate-range ballistic missile test. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe conferred right there in the dining room, where Trump and his team prepared a written response and took phone calls about the international emergency within earshot of club members eating dinner.\n68. The world leaders then held an emergency joint press conference. Abe spoke for about two minutes, during which he condemned the launch as \u201cabsolutely intolerable\u201d and demanded that North Korea comply with UN Security Council regulations. Abe added that President Trump \u201cassured me that the United States would always stand with Japan, 100 percent.\u201d Prime Minister Abe handed the mic to DJ Trump, who said, in full, \u201cI just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent. Thank you.\u201d A prepared speech that actually mentioned the missile launch went ignored on the lectern. Trump left without taking any questions.\n72. I found this picture.", "Best Buy and Cisco made notable moves as stocks rose on Thursday.\nStocks rose on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI)ticking higher into record territory as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) index finished up nearly 0.5%.\nFinancial stocks resumed their stunning post-election rally as the Financial Sector Select SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT:XLF) rose 1% to reach a 13% spike over just the past week. As for major ETF losers, the volatile Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:NUGT) sank by 4% as gold prices slipped.\nMeanwhile, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) posted significant swings following their quarterly earnings announcements.\nBest Buy shares rallied 14% after the company revealed improving business trends heading into the biggest retailing quarter of the year. Comparable-store sales increased 2%, for a decent acceleration over the prior quarter's 1% uptick. The retailer also managed much faster earnings growth as operating profit margin jumped to 4% of sales from 3% last year. \"We are pleased to report today growth on both our top and bottom lines,\" CEO Hubert Joly said in a press release.\nInnovation in the consumer-electronics space helped push customer traffic higher, with leading product categories including home theater, mobile phones, and wearable tech. Gains in those areas were offset by a continued slump in video gaming.\nBest Buy held the line on prices, and that discipline helped gross profit margin expand to 24.7% of sales, from 24.1%. The company soundly beat its own earnings guidance, logging non-GAAP profit of $0.62 per share compared to the $0.45 per share it forecast back in August.\nLooking ahead, Joly and his team see innovation continuing to drive customers to its stores over the holidays. Sales growth is likely to stay uncomfortably close to zero, though. Still, executives aim to hit that steady figure while significantly scaling back on promotions. If it works, the strategy should result in non-GAAP earnings of as high as $3.30 per share for the full year, or 19% higher than fiscal 2016.\nCisco was the biggest loser on the Dow, dropping 5% following the tech giant's fiscal first-quarter results. As expected, revenue ticked up by 1%, and gross margin was 64% for a slight increase over the prior quarter.\nManagement highlighted strong growth in the routing, security, and service segments that together offset declines in major categories, including switches and collaboration hardware. The U.S. geography was Cisco's weakest as clients continued to defer their major IT spending projects. \"We had a good quarter despite a challenging global business environment and we performed well in our priority areas,\" CEO Chuck Robbins said.\nCisco sees those challenges continuing into the current quarter, which is typically when many large clients set their budget for the coming calendar year. Robbins and his team see revenue declining by as much as 4% as gross margin ticks down to 63% of sales.\nThese figures translate into non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, below consensus estimates of $0.59 per share. While only a slight miss, the downbeat forecast was enough to send shares lower for what remains one of the Dow's best-performing stocks in 2016.", "Across the Corn Belt, a substantial snow cover exists in the upper Midwest, where snow depths include 9 inches in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and 8 inches in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Meanwhile, mild, dry weather across the central and eastern Corn Belt is allowing water to drain from fields and streams into larger rivers. The highest Ohio River crest since 1997 has passed Louisville, Kentucky, and is approaching Evansville, Indiana.\nOn the Plains, cold weather prevails in Montana and the Dakotas, where an extensive snow cover continues to insulate winter wheat. Meanwhile, warm weather has returned to the central and southern High Plains, where rangeland, pastures, and winter wheat are suffering from a lack of moisture. On February 25, the portion of the wheat crop rated very poor to poor included 78% in Oklahoma, 73% in Texas, and 49% in Kansas.\nIn the South, a few showers are returning to the western Gulf Coast region. Elsewhere, mild, dry weather prevails, although extensive lowland flooding persists from eastern Texas into the mid-South.\nIn the West, widely scattered showers dot central and southern California and the Intermountain West. Cool conditions persist, with some scattered sub-zero temperatures noted early Tuesday across the interior Northwest.\nDuring the next 2 days, heavy rain will re-develop across parts of the South, as well as the central and eastern Corn Belt. Storm-total rainfall through Thursday could reach 2 to 4 inches from northeastern Texas into the Tennessee Valley, and 1 to 2 inches across the eastern half of the Corn Belt. Additional flooding can be expected in areas already experiencing soil saturation. Meanwhile, mid- to late-week snow will fall from the northern Corn Belt into the Northeast. In contrast, dry weather will persist through week\u2019s end on the central and southern High Plains. In the West, however, some of the most impressive storminess of the season will arrive at mid-week. Heavy, high-elevation snow will fall as far south as the Sierra Nevada.\nLooking ahead, the 6- to 10-day outlook calls for the likelihood of below-normal temperatures in the middle and southern Atlantic States, as well as the northwestern half of the Plains and the West. Near- to above-normal temperatures can be expected from the western and central Gulf Coast States into the Great Lakes region and the Northeast. Meanwhile, near- to below-normal precipitation in the eastern U.S. and most areas from the High Plains westward will contrast with wetter-than-normal weather in northern and central California and the Mississippi Valley and environs.", "SALT LAKE CITY & SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation (CCF) today announced a new partnership with Komodo Health\u2122, a first-of-its-kind agreement linking a cancer advocacy group with the leading healthcare analytics and insights delivery company to advance the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The agreement allows the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation to access previously inaccessible information, data, and disease-treatment reference points through Komodo Health\u2019s largest, most actionable healthcare map in the U.S.\nThis new partnership will enable the Foundation to have a nearly real-time and comprehensive picture of the patient landscape, based on Komodo\u2019s proprietary patient graph. With this advance, the Foundation is now equipped to provide patients with timely information on local specialists and give local providers data on promising therapies, including the rapidly emerging options available to CCA patients.\nCholangiocarcinoma is a \u201csilent\u201d form of cancer that originates from the cells lining the bile ducts. It is often labeled a silent disease because many times the signs and symptoms go unnoticed until the cancer is in the advanced stage. Even when early signs and symptoms become known, they may be vague and easily attributed to another disease. Approximately 9,000 new cases are diagnosed each year\u2014and these numbers are growing as CCA has the second highest rising incidence rate.\nAccelerate access to the best possible care by creating a platform for CCF, patients, providers, and biopharma companies to improve the speed, quality, and options for cholangiocarcinoma care.\nEstablish ground-level truth on cholangiocarcinoma epidemiology to help drive additional research and therapies.\nIdentify and engage the most relevant members and institutions of the medical and scientific community to help set a higher standard of care for how cholangiocarcinoma patients are treated.\nUse anonymized near real-time patient data to see where cholangiocarcinoma patient pools are being treated in both the major cancer centers and locally to help guide CCF education and outreach.\nDesign data-driven programs and make decisions that directly affect patients.\nIdentify and more effectively partner with biopharma companies who are in early phase development of treatments that might be effective for the patient population.\nIdentify opportunities to partner with the major cancer centers for outreach and education programs.\nIdentify and engage investigators researching CCA that want to collaborate and join the International Cholangiocarcinoma Research Network (ICRN).\nCreate a state-by-state list of CCA specialists based on objective clinical data.\nFounded in 2014, Komodo Health has built the most comprehensive patient-centric healthcare data and analytics platform. The platform delivers patient-level insights by dynamically analyzing the broadest array of data across patients, practitioners, and health systems. In addition to the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation, their partnerships include others in the healthcare ecosystem including life sciences, providers, payers, and patient advocacy groups. Komodo Health monitors medical data on more than 50 billion clinical transactions, 280 million U.S. patients, 3.5 million healthcare practitioners, and 450,000 healthcare organizations, integrated delivery networks, accountable care organizations, and health systems.\nThe Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation and Komodo Health plan to track the impact of the collaboration over time in terms of the increase in the number of patients treated by specialists.\nFounded in 2006, the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation is a global 501(c) (3) non-profit organization whose mission is to find a cure and improve the quality of life for those affected by bile duct cancer. As a rare and lethal disease, cholangiocarcinoma lacks attention and sufficient resources. There is a vast, unmet need for education about cholangiocarcinoma across the entire disease spectrum\u2014from bench to bedside. For that reason, the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation continues its efforts to raise awareness of all stakeholders in the cholangiocarcinoma community through advocacy, education, collaboration and research. More information is available at www.cholangiocarcinoma.org.\nKomodo Health is a healthcare technology company focused on addressing the global burden of disease through the most representative and actionable healthcare map. Komodo Health\u2019s real-time intelligence engine provides healthcare leaders with the tools to modernize and improve the way they engage and serve the medical community, resulting in a more transparent, efficient, and productive healthcare ecosystem. The Company values a culture of encouraging growth, collaboration, and constructive debate to deliver on its mission to improve patient care and reduce the burden of disease through the world's most actionable healthcare map.

The responses from the 12 participants, which made headlines at the time, no longer seem shocking because we\u2019ve heard so many similar stories over the last two months.\nFear and loathing of the choice facing voters on Nov. 8 is one of the defining features of this election, and not just among swing voters. Nowhere is that more true than in Wisconsin, which stands alone as the only battleground state this year where Democrats and Republicans resoundingly rejected both current nominees in their party primaries earlier this year.\nIt seems a distant memory, but Bernie Sanders, led by a wave of millennials and progressives, crushed Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by 13 percentage points in that April 5 primary. Ted Cruz, boosted by well-organized anti-Trump forces in a last-ditch effort to derail Trump\u2019s candidacy, prevailed in the Badger State by an equal margin.\nNow Clinton, Trump, and their respective surrogates are back, courting many of the very same voters who spurned them just months ago. With turnout at a premium, both candidates face challenges in motivating their voters to get to the polls. As of this week, Hillary Clinton holds a 6.7 point lead over Donald Trump in the RealClearPolitics Average of polls in Wisconsin.\nWisconsin may be the birthplace of the Grand Old Party, but it hasn\u2019t gone for a Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan\u2019s 49-state landslide win in 1984. George W. Bush nearly flipped the state red in 2000, losing to Al Gore by just 5,708 votes out of more than 2.5 million ballots cast. Bush almost did it again in 2004, losing to John Kerry by only 11,384 votes.\nAfter those consecutive nail-biters, the state fell hard for Barack Obama in 2008, with Wisconsinites giving him a 14-point win, nearly double the margin by which he won election nationally. Ditto 2012, when the state gave Obama a seven-point victory while winning nationally by just less than four.\nBut things changed in Wisconsin in 2010, when a young, ambitious conservative Milwaukee County Executive named Scott Walker won the gubernatorial race. Walker\u2019s election, and the subsequent battle over his agenda that included taking on public sector unions, turned Wisconsin into a proxy war between the most powerful political forces in America.\nWalker was in office less than a year before the effort to recall him began. He survived the 2012 recall, and won a hard fought re-election in 2014. A recall of a state Supreme Court justice in 2011 and battles over the razor-thin control of the state Senate added to the mayhem. For six straight years, the two major political parties in Wisconsin have been engaged in constant hand-to-hand political combat. One side effect is that the foot soldiers in both parties are trained, organized, and informed. Democrats and Republicans know exactly where all the votes are in the state and how to deliver them.\nThe downside of such perpetual political warfare is that all but the most hard-core ideologues are fatigued. Voters are tired of the ads, phone calls, mailers, and constant exhortations about the next election being the most important of their lives.\nBy most accounts, there\u2019s one group of voters who aren\u2019t exhausted: supporters of Donald Trump. That\u2019s the good news for Trump: His folks are energized and excited. The bad news for the GOP nominee? There\u2019s probably not enough of them for him to win.\nTrump needs more Republican voters, particularly in Waukesha County, a heavily Republican suburb just west of Milwaukee. Waukesha delivered 161,567 votes to Mitt Romney in 2012, a 35-point margin of victory over Obama. Trump isn\u2019t anywhere near that right now.\n\u201cEven though Trump is winning the Milwaukee suburbs, he\u2019s only winning by a little bit, and he ought to be winning by a lot.\"\nCan he make it up in other parts of the state? One former star in Wisconsin politics thinks so. Former Gov. Tommy Thompson told RCP that Trump is running strong in places where Republicans haven\u2019t always done well.\n\u201cDonald is resonating in Democratic areas like the 7th Congressional District as well as the 3rd that have been going Democratic,\u201d said Thompson, who cites that strength as a reason he believes Trump can win the state in November.\nMeanwhile, Hillary Clinton faces her own turnout challenge. Namely, she needs to get African-Americans in Milwaukee and millennials in Dane County, home of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, to the polls on Election Day.\nBernie Sanders returned to Wisconsin last Tuesday, the first time he'd been back to the state since delivering his victory speech in April. Sanders, at a rally in Madison that drew 1,100 people, urged his supporters to back Clinton.\n\"Get beyond the personality. Get beyond the negativity,\" Sanders said. \"Just take a hard look at which candidate is better for the middle classs and working families of this country, and when we do that, we will find overwhelmingly that Hillary Clinton is that candidate.\"\nNo one could have predicted that three men who grew up just a few miles from each other in southeastern Wisconsin would eventually rise to command the ultimate heights of the Republican Party. Yet by 2015 Scott Walker, Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus had done just that, with Walker as a two-term governor and presidential contender, Ryan the 2012 vice presidential nominee and later speaker of the House, and Priebus as the well-liked head of the Republican National Committee.\nThen came Trump, who bullied his way to the presidential nomination and became titular head of that very same Republican Party.\nWalker, surprisingly, was the first Republican to be chased from the 2016 race, in part because of Trump\u2019s presence in Iowa. Although Walker urged most of the other contenders to drop out to stop Trump for the good of the party, none of them obliged. Months later Walker ended up endorsing the billionaire businessman.\nDespite the obvious pain it\u2019s caused him at times, Priebus has largely played the role of loyal party chairman, sticking with Trump throughout the nominee\u2019s controversies, including the 2005 recording of Trump making lewd remarks about women.\nRyan remains popular in his home state, but it\u2019s unclear exactly how the Ryan-Trump feud might play out on Nov. 8, either at the top of the ticket or in the down-ballot races.\nAmong those down-ballot races is one of the country\u2019s most-watched Senate contests. In 2010, Ron Johnson was a heavy underdog to upset a three-term Democratic incumbent in a blue-leaning state. But the Republican wave of 2010 rose high enough to wash Russ Feingold out to Lake Superior, and Johnson won by five points.\nSix years later, Johnson is experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Once again he\u2019s running against Russ Feingold. Once again he\u2019s the underdog. Until recently, Johnson had been one of the few incumbent Republican senators polling lower than Trump in his home state. While Johnson colleagues Kelly Ayotte (New Hampshire) and Pat Toomey (Pennsylvania) are facing similarly difficult re-election environments, they\u2019re running roughly six to nine points better than Trump in their respective blue-tilting states. One sign of just how bad things have gotten for Johnson is that both the Republican and Democratic senatorial committees pulled their resources out of Wisconsin last week, to move that money to states they believe are more competitive.\nYet any pronouncement of Johnson\u2019s political demise might be premature. A new Marquette poll released Wednesday shows him trailing Feingold by just two points, 46 percent to 44 percent, a net gain of three points from last month\u2019s survey. Other polls appear to show a tightening of the race as well. Feingold\u2019s lead over Johnson in the RealClearPolitics Average currently stands at three points, a significant drop from a couple of weeks ago.\nJohnson\u2019s struggles stem in part from his lack of familiarity with voters in the state. Despite having been in office for the last six years, he still isn\u2019t very well known.\nPolling confirms Sykes\u2019 point. The percentage of people who say they \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d enough about Johnson to have a favorable or unfavorable opinion about him has consistently hovered around 30. And that\u2019s still where he stands less than a month from Election Day. Feingold, on the other hand, remains a well-known quantity to Wisconsinites, despite having been off the stage for the last six years.\nAnd like other Republican incumbents running for re-election, Johnson has struggled with the Trump factor. Throughout the summer and much of the fall, Johnson kept his distance, saying that he would support the Republican nominee without explicitly endorsing Trump. That awkward dance continued last week with the release of Trump\u2019s \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording. Johnson called Trump\u2019s comments \u201ccompletely indefensible\u201d which the first-term senator hopes does not turn out to be the epitaph for Republicans\u2019 chances in Wisconsin next month.", "NEW YORK \u2013 Wanna be the first to score a copy of the Spice Girls greatest-hits album? You&apos;ll have to go through Victoria&apos;s Secret to get it.\nThe newly reunited British girl group&apos;s CD will be available starting Nov. 13 at Victoria&apos;s Secret stores and on the company&apos;s Web site in the U.S., Capitol Music Group said Tuesday.\nThe \"Spice Girls: Greatest Hits\" features 13 hits, including \"Wannabe\" and \"Spice up Your Life,\" and two new songs, \"Voodoo\" and the upcoming single, \"Headlines (Friendship Never Ends).\"\nCapitol said the disc will be available nationwide Jan. 15.\nThe original Girl Power group of the 1990s will also appear at the annual Victoria&apos;s Secret fashion show, set to air Dec. 4 on CBS.\nThe Spice Girls were one of the biggest acts of the &apos;90s with more than 55 million records sold.

Her character eventually left the service industry with the help of Lady Sybil. To American viewers, she followed up Downton Abbey with Game of Thrones where she played Ygritte, the Wildling warrior and romantic interest for Jon Snow (played by her real-life fianc\u00e9 Kit Harington). The character was adorned in furs with a dirt smudged face, slung bows and arrows and charged into battles with the best of them. Now, Leslie's TV battles are little more civilized, but which does she find the more formidable character?\n\"Well, I think they're two very, very different characters. The physique that one has to adopt in high heel shoes\u2014automatically your shoulders are kind of pushed back because you're trying to walk in them and your core strength is being used. I think that that informs the kind of body language on screen, and I think that as a formidable character it's going to be hard to counteract that if you're going to be, I don't know, wrapped up in furs and running over a hill. I find both of them formidable in their own unique ways,\" Leslie said.\n\"With Maia, there's a sharpness to the world of The Good Fight and the beautiful outfits we get to wear absolutely inform the kind of determination we have, kind of episodically speaking with all six court cases that we find ourselves in. So I think the shoes, the clothes and the hairstyles and the kind of badass outfits that we get to wear definitely help getting across as a formidable presence,\" she continued.\nSeason one of The Good Fight ended with Leslie's Maia Rindell facing arrest following several twists in the investigation into the financial scam perpetrated by Maia's parents (played by Paul Guilfoyle and Bernadette Peters). Leslie's character, a lawyer just out of law school, faced a baptism by fire during her first season. She's changed by the experience.\n\"She had an absolutely kind of awful time of it in season one\u2026All aspects of her life were crumbling, and yet what I love and what has inspired me about her, is that she's managed to kind of spin that incredibly traumatic experience into what essentially is the makings of her,\" Leslie said. \"I think that's very noteworthy because in life it's easier to admit defeat, but there has now been a turning point within Maia and a realization that the dilemma that she has managed to kind of get through has allowed for an opportunity for her to mature and evolve as a woman.\"\nOne thing that hasn't changed about Maia is the way her sexual orientation is portrayed on screen. Maia is a lesbian on the series, but her sexuality does not define her. It's just a matter of fact.\n\"What I enjoyed about Maia is that yes, it doesn't define her, it's how I feel sexuality should always be portrayed on TV. So I feel that it is written and the way the character presents herself, I don't necessarily feel responsibility simply because you are who you are and as a result there's no need to project or kind of milk the situation or the sexuality. It just is what it is, and that simplicity is something that I hold in high regard because it should be accepted and one should move on and be regarded for their actions rather than their sexual orientation,\" Leslie said.\nSeason two of the CBS All Access series will continue to mine the current political landscape for drama, but will also introduce a new layer: Lawyers are scared, not for their paycheck, but for their lives.\n\"There's an overarching sense within this season of the lawyers being targeted and killed by disgruntled clients and they all have their own reasons as well for targeting us as a law firm. I think the brilliance of undertone of fear and that makes people react in all sorts of different manners. And I think the challenges with Maia is for her to keep her head above it all, carry on working and carry on fighting for what she believes in. There's a resolve to her character,\" Leslie said. \"She is kind of searching for a mentor and finds it in Liz Reddick [Audra McDonald] and I think that speaks volumes of her and who she wants to become and evolve into\u2026She's no longer the kind of vulnerable girl. There's a transition that you see in her and that's exciting to the audience as well.\"\nMaisie Williams Knows How Game of Thrones Ends...And So Does Her Mom!\nLeslie has her own challenges as well. She's in Brooklyn, New York filming The Good Fight while husband-to-be Harington is overseas filming the final season of Game of Thrones. The wedding planning is still ongoing, and figuring out \"tiny little details\" over FaceTime or email \"is hard\" and the distance \"does make things a little bit trickier, but no, for the most part we agreed on most things,\" she said with a laugh. \"Which is good.\"\nAnd a message to fans, one she made clear to her Good Fight cast and crew from the beginning: Don't ask her for Game of Thrones spoilers.\n\"Oh, Chris! I've hands down said from the beginning, sadly as season eight is now being shot I don't want to know anything about Game of Thrones in terms of any spoilers and what the storyline is going to be. I want to be sitting down on my sofa along with the rest of world, as excited and as pumped. Genuinely, I don't have a clue! I don't have a clue and I'm very happy about that because all of this anticipation, all of this building up is just going to be so satisfying when we finally get to watch the first episode,\" she said with a laugh.\nThe Good Fight drops new episodes Sundays on CBS All Access.", "The teen survived by catching fish and filtering seawater through his clothes.\nAn Indonesian teenager has been rescued from the ocean after spending 49 days adrift at sea. The 19-year-old Aldi Novel Adilang was rescued by a passing cargo ship and taken to Japan, where he\u2019s made a full recovery and returned home to Indonesia.\nAldi works as a \u2018lamp keeper,\u2019 a type of fisherman common in southeast Asia. For months, Aldi and other lamp keepers would live on small rafts called rompongs, lighting lamps to attract and catch fish. Once a week, the company that employed Aldi would collect the fish and resupply his raft. He worked at this job for three years.\nA typical rompong is moored so it stays in the same place, and as such has no motor, sails, or oars to maneuver. On July 14, a storm broke the moorings on Aldi\u2019s rompong, setting him adrift. With only a week\u2019s worth of supplies, he was quickly forced to resort to catching fish and drinking seawater filtered through his clothes.\nAldi drifted and survived this way for seven weeks, at times nearly giving up. Multiple vessels sailed past his raft, but none saw him or stopped. After nearly losing hope, he was spotted by the cargo ship Arpeggio and taken to Japan. He spent two days in the country before being handed off to the Indonesian consulate in Japan and put on a plane back home to Manado.\n\u201cAldi\u2019s story is indeed dramatic, and we are thankful to all, the ship\u2019s captain and the Japanese authorities that have been very helpful in ensuring Aldi\u2019s return,\u201d said Indonesian consul general Mirza Nurhidayat.", "Ongoing guide to Halloween fun.

I don\u2019t have a Kindle, but play the audiobook on my tablet while simultaneously manually turning the pages in the Kindle eBook.\nYou mean, friends you actually *know* and have met?\nWhy not try spending as much time in church praying for this sorry world, as PokeMon Goers do on this asinine pursuit of mindless, triviality?\nIn the words of \u201cWhy Don\u2019t You\u201d an eighties UK kids magazine show \u2013 \u201cJust switch off your TV set (mobile phone in this case) and do something less boring instead\u201d \u2013 you could build a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Tracey island following the instructions of Lesley Judd on Blue Peter, another age old BBC kids TV show.", "RUMPHI-(MaraviPost)- Former cabinet minister in the Joyce Banda administration, Enoch Chihana, who is also Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) President, this week challenged Government that he was ready to be arrested alongside Banda.\nChihana, who was a Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture under the former Malawi President, claims Banda was not alone when she made some of the decisions that resulted in the warrant of arrest.\nThe AFORD President said this in reacting to last week\u2019s Malawi Police Service (MPS) announcement of the warrant of arrest for Banda over Cashgate charges, issued by the police.\nIn the statement, Police said they have \u201ccredible evidence\u201d against the former President on matters of abuse of office and money laundering.\n\u201cRunning Government is a collective responsibility, because the President, the Vice and all the Cabinet ministers are involved in making the decisions. If Dr. Joyce Banda did something wrong, then all the ministers, including me, did wrong, and we should be arrested,\u201d Chihana challenged.\nChihana\u2019s sentiment on the matter has attracted mix reactions from various scholars wherein, some have differed with him.\nFahad Assani, who was Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs in the Banda administration, differed with Chihana and argues that the Police work, is evidence.\n\u201cPolice base it [warrant of arrest] on evidence they gather on a particular individual, unless there are leads linking to others involved. Ordinarily, when you apply for a warrant of arrest, it is a particular person\u2019s involvement in whatever suspicions you have in terms of the investigation,\u201d Assani observed.\nIn his, remarks legal expert, Justin Dzonzi, said collective responsibility is a general statement and if Chihana proved there was a cabinet decision made involving all the ministers, then his claim would hold.\nDzonzi asked Chihana to prove that the cabinet agreed to plunder public resources.\n\u201cChihana must show that cashgate was a Government policy under Joyce Banda, and that it was itself a subject of a cabinet discussion and adoption.\n\u201cIf however, if the connection between the President and cashgate does not necessarily revolve around a cabinet policy approval, then only individuals who participated in that scheme, would be called to answer. All in all, the question is: is there evidence to show who participated and to what extent?\u201d Dzonzi said.\nPeople\u2019s Party Administrative Secretary, Joseph Chikwemba, said it remains incumbent on former cabinet ministers who feel they were involved to surrender themselves to the authorities.\n\u201cWe are yet to see the evidence the Police have (but) if any former minister feels they were involved, they can surrender themselves to the authorities,\u201d Chikwemba said.\nFormer ministers in the Joyce Banda administration have also differed over the calls to put all former cabinet ministers behind bars on the basis that the former Malawi leader was not making unilateral decision that resulted in the infamous plunder of public funds.", "Bush delivers his seventh state of the union address with polls showing him at the weakest point of his presidency.\nA Washington-Post/ABC News poll released on Monday gave Bush a job approval rating of 33 per cent, showing him to be at the weakest point of his presidency.\n\"Like many before us, we can work through our differences, and achieve big things for the American people\"\nIn his address to a nation increasingly opposed to the Iraq war and to a congress which for the first time in his presidency is controlled by Democrats, Bush will stress the need for unity.\n\"Congress has changed, but our responsibilities have not.\n\"Like many before us, we can work through our differences, and achieve big things for the American people,\" he says.\nHe is to warn that failure in Iraq could embolden Iran in what Washington believes is its pursuit of nuclear weapons, according to Stephen Hadley, the national security adviser to the president.\nWhile Iraq will be high on the agenda, Bush will also use the address to outline a domestic policy for the year.\nHe is to propose a reduction in US fuel usage by 20 per cent in 10 years, an increase in health care for Americans, a new immigration policy and improvements to education.\nBush will say that improved vehicle fuel standards and diversification of energy sources \u2013 such as the use of ethanol fuel \u2013 is necessary.\n\"It is in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply and the way forward is through technology,\" he says.\nThe energy proposals by Bush fall short of seeking mandatory caps on carbon emissions which are sought by some Democrats in the congress.\nBush is not pushing for a specific increase in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which many experts see as critical to reduce oil usage but which the White House fears would prompt manufacturers to build smaller, less-safe cars.\nInstead, he will ask congress for authority to reform CAFE standards, with the goal of reducing projected annual fuel use by up to 8.5 billion gallons, according to Joel Kaplan, the deputy White House chief of staff.\nBush will also call for doubling the strategic petroleum reserve from 727 million barrels to 1.5 billion barrels, in a bid to bolster US energy security.\nThe US will begin buying extra oil this spring as part of a plan by the Bush administration to expand emergency reserves, the White House said on Tuesday.\n\"Expanding the strategic petroleum reserve is a wise and a prudent policy decision that would provide an additional layer of protection for our nation's energy security,\" said Sam Bodman, the US energy secretary.\nMeanwhile, Bush's health care plan will propose making health insurance taxable income and deductible up to $15,000 a year for families, starting in 2009.\nThe move could raise taxes for as many as 30 million Americans but lower costs for many others.\nA US official said the plan would cost $30 to $40 billion in its formative years but eventually pay for itself.", "Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn restated his desire to tackle anti-Semitism as a senior MP accused the party of being \u2018institutionally racist\u2019.\nJeremy Corbyn said Labour would tackle the \u201csocial cancer\u201d of anti-Semitism as a senior MP accused the party of being \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d.\nLabour leader Mr Corbyn acknowledged it was a \u201cdifficult time\u201d for Britain\u2019s Jewish communities, but reiterated his promise to tackle anti-Semitism in the party.\nBut the row over the Labour response to the issue and the divisions among the party\u2019s MPs over Mr Corbyn\u2019s leadership continued to simmer.\nFormer frontbencher Chuka Umunna made the claim that Labour was an institutionally racist as a result of the anti-Semitism row.\nHe said it was a \u201cvery painful\u201d admission, but vowed to stay on as a Labour member because he felt it was better to \u201ctry and argue and see change through in an organisation\u201d rather than \u201cleave the field\u201d.\nHe told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge On Sunday: \u201cIf you look at the definition of institutional racism as outlined by Sir William Macpherson in the Macpherson Report and the Macpherson Inquiry produced the institutional racism definition.\n\u201cThe Labour Party, it\u2019s beyond doubt for me that it has met it \u2013 it\u2019s very painful for me to say that.\nMr Corbyn, in a Rosh Hashanah message, said: \u201cI would like to reiterate that the Labour Party stands in solidarity with the Jewish community in the fight against anti-Semitism.\n\u201cWe will work to eradicate the social cancer of anti-Semitism wherever is surfaces, including in our own party.\n\u201cWe need change and I hope this year we can make this happen.\nStreatham MP Mr Umunna made his comments after being urged to apologise for saying Mr Corbyn should \u201ccall off the dogs\u201d to stop centre-left MPs being driven out of the party.\nLabour Party chairman Ian Lavery told Sky News that Mr Umunna\u2019s call was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cCalling anybody a dog is absolutely outrageous in the extreme, and Chuka Umunna of all people should know that.\n\u201cAnd I hope that when he comes onto your show this morning that he takes this opportunity of apologising to those people who he\u2019s offended immensely.\nMr Lavery also said MPs should be \u201caccountable\u201d and expect to be challenged, after a number of Labour MPs who have been critical of Mr Corbyn \u2013 particularly over his handling of the anti-Semitism row, have found themselves locked in battles with members of their constituency Labour party.\nLabour Friends of Israel chairwoman Joan Ryan, a former minister under Tony Blair, and Luton South MP Gavin Shuker, both lost local no confidence votes on Thursday.\nBut Mr Lavery, MP for Wansbeck, said: \u201cThese votes of no confidence hold no water, they are basically a statement from the constituencies.\nIn a sign that Labour is seeking to move on from the damaging row over anti-Semitism, John McDonnell set out plans for private firms with more than 250 staff to set up \u201cownership funds\u201d to give workers a financial stake and influence in their companies.\nThe shadow chancellor said he wants to deliver an \u201cirreversible shift in wealth and power in favour of working people\u201d as Labour prepares for a general election within months.\nMr McDonnell set out his plans in an Observer interview, in which he said Labour must be ready for an election because the Tories are on the brink of collapse.", "1993 - Ray Peterson, a painting contractor, gives a house on Cromer Drive a striped look as he concentrates on painting seams before doing other parts of the building.\n- Tuomey Hospital has been designated by the office of Civilian Penicillin Distribution War Production Board as a depot for penicillin for this area, John W. Rankin, superintendent, was notified. The hospital, during the past month, has been procuring penicillin from the depot at the Columbia hospital, Mr. Rankin said. Approximately three million units of the wonder drug were used at Tuomey during May. Under the new arrangement, with the local hospital as a depot, there will be approximately six million units of penicillin available during June, the superintendent added.\n- Cpl. James Rollin Galloway died May 16 of wounds received in action in the Italian theater, his sisters were notified by a war department telegram. The message from the adjutant general gave no details but expressed the deepest sympathy and stated that a letter would follow. Two of Cpl. Galloway's sisters reside in Sumter, Miss Athleen Galloway and Mrs. D. E. Scurry. A third sister, Mrs. G. W. Guill, is a resident of Columbia.\n- The office of the supervisors of registration for Sumter County will be open in the courthouse for the registration of qualified citizens to vote in the general election in November. Those who have registration certificates issued in 1938 or since do not have to register now. If the certificate has been lost, a duplicate may be obtained from the supervisors. Democrats who wish to vote in the primary may enroll at the same time by signing the roll book of the ward club of the district in which they reside. These books are kept at the courthouse, in charge of Mr. Horace Harby, and will be open every day for enrollment of members until June 27.\n- Chief W. C. Kirven said that the Auxiliary Police Force responded very quickly to the city force's call for assistance during the Gulf Oil fire and aided the municipal officers in handling traffic and so on. Chief Kirven wishes to remind the public of the city ordinance which forbids us to go within a block of a fire, that is, unless directly connected with the police or fire departments. There is also an ordinance against following fire trucks. The other night at the Gulf Oil fire, the audience was so eager it almost got right into the flames, and officers had their hands full keeping order. Chief Lynam told us that had one of the big gasoline tanks exploded, it would have been a real tragedy and could have killed everyone on the block. So, leave the firefighting to the men who are trained for it.\n- In a fast game of baseball on the Brooklyn-Cayce diamond, West Columbia defeated the Sumter American Legion Juniors, 4 to 0. The game was played in an hour and 45 minutes. The pitching was excellent on both sides. Morris secured the only hit for Sumter. Only five of the Gamecocks struck out, but they were not able to hit Mack effectively. Stokes and Reynolds made nice fielding plays.\n- Boy Scout officials announced today that another waste paper drive will be conducted in the city. The public is urged to collect paper and have it on hand for the Scouts, preferably in convenient-to-handle bundles. Shaw Field is cooperating again by lending its trucks. Six of the vehicles will be at the Scouts' disposal when the white residential sections will be covered, and on Thursday, when the business district is to be canvassed. On Friday, Shaw Field will send two trucks for the use of black Scouts to go through the black residential and business sections.\n- The Daily Vacation Bible School to be held at the Presbyterian Sunday School June 5-16 will begin Monday morning. Mrs. Frank King will be in charge of the beginner department, for children four and five years old. The primary children will be taught by Miss Isabel McLaurin, Mrs. Byron H. Gilliand and Miss Marjorie Patterson; the juniors by Mrs. W. T. Nixon, Mrs. W. B. Upshur and Mrs. C. P. Beckman; and the junior high school boys and girls by Miss Page Lancaster.\n- Shaw Field's Fliers flushed with a 10-9 victory over a strongly favored Greenville Army Air Base team in 10 innings will be after another win when they encounter the 346th Battalion team of Fort Jackson. The game will be played at Municipal Park and will start at 8:30. The Shaw Field band has been scheduled for a 30-minute concert preceding the contest. Last night the Fliers overcame an early Greenville lead and finally won out over the visitors in the 10th inning.\n- E. C. Stroman of the Belk-Stroman company has only praise for the recently opened YMCA Health Club. In a letter to Carl Link, general secretary of the YMCA, Mr. Stroman said, \"I needed to visit the Health Club only once to become convinced that the men of Sumter are afforded an unusual opportunity to keep in better physical condition. The average business man, especially in these busy times, often neglects his physical condition. There should be no excuse for this as long as the Health Club is in operation.\"\n- The new ambulance service for Sumter answered eight calls from midnight Friday to 2'oclock this morning. Tuomey Hospital administrator Ralph Abercrombie said that five of those calls were accidents, and the other three were for other medical reasons. \"The new service was quite impressive over this first weekend,\" Abercrombie said. The new ambulance service took over the ambulance and rescue operations for Sumter County on Friday night. The service has a heavy emergency vehicle to be used for long distances and two lightweight utility vehicles for regular ambulance functions in the county phase of the operation.\n- The South Carolina Jaycees are now narrowing their search for the Outstanding Young Farmer for 1968-69. State OYF Chairman James P. Nettles Jr. of Sumter announced that all regional entries are in and a panel of outstanding judges are selecting the state winner. The state winner will be announced at the state OYF luncheon during the Jaycee Winter Board Meeting in Charleston.\n- Rebuilding of the dam at Second Mill Pond, which was ruined by heavy rains in March 1965, is underway and should be completed by spring. Second Mill Pond was once a popular recreation spot, but after the dam broke, the drying pond became a bed of insects and mosquitoes and the dried grass a fire hazard. Many complaints were voiced by area residents to the County Board of Commissioners about repairing the dam and refilling the pond. The County Board of Commissioners agreed to repair the dam at Second Mill on condition that the Elks Club, which owns the property, provide the cost of materials in the amount of $7,500.\n- Feb. 2-8 is the 21st-annual National Children's Dental Health Week. As part of the observance, the Sumter Daily Item, in cooperation with the Pee Dee Dental Society, today begins a series of six articles on facts you should know about dental health. Generally, the outlook is very optimistic for complete control of tooth decay within the next 10 to 20 years. Scientists have recently reported on a number of studies that have produced significant results. One of the most promising studies - still to be conducted with human subjects - involves the use of a specific enzyme called dexgtranase in the control of dental decay.\n- After Morris College found itself behind by 21 points at half-time - 63-42 - it would have been easy to give up. Thanks to a wealth of poise, Morris didn't give up and outscored Barber-Scottia College by 22 points in the second half to capture a thrilling 113-112 victory. It put the Morris record over 500 for the first time this season at 9-8. It also furnished opposition with a notice that the Hornets are no pushovers.\n- Sherrian Angela Floyd, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry B. Floyd of Sumter, has been selected as a candidate-at-large in the \"Little Miss North America\" contest to be held in Wildwood, New Jersey, June 12-15. The pageant is being sponsored by the city of Wildwood. Contestants and their mothers will be guests of the city during their stay.\n- The Edmunds High School Gamecocks used a team effort to easily defeat Hartsville 66-47 and win their 11th game out of 14 outings. Four of five starters soared into double figures in scoring, and Coach Charlie Hodgin got a chance to get his bench a workout in the encounter.\n- Sumter Area TEC, in cooperation with the Internal Revenue Service, is presenting a short course entitled \"Preparation of Personal Income Tax Returns.\" The course will be taught by a representative of the IRS and will consist of six two-hour classes designed to help the individual taxpayer in preparing his federal income tax return.\n- Town and Country Manufacturing Co. announced plans today for a half-million-dollar construction project which will double the capacity of the Sumter mobile home manufacturing plant. The announcement was made by Larry Pinchback, vice president of Town and Country.\n- Brig. Gen. Donovan F. Smith, vice commander of Tactical Air Command's Ninth Air Force, has been nominated for promotion to the rank of major general. The World War II ace and holder of the Distinguished Service Cross will do the two-star rank during the next year. General officers, once confirmed by Congress, are promoted as vacancies occur. Gen. Smith's colorful career includes eight aerial victories during World War II and 18 months duty as chief adviser to the Vietnamese Air Force.\n- Shaw is in for some new facilities this year coming through a $1.7 million Military Construction Program here. The program takes in almost everything from parking lots to air conditioning. The second phase of parking lot construction has already begun at the base hospital with completion scheduled in May. The new cold storage plant is now 84 percent complete and should be done in March.\n- Sumter School District 17 has been named as one of 33 South Carolina school districts whose desegregation plans have been approved by the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. District 17 school superintendent Dr. L.C. McArthur Jr. said that he has not been officially notified of HEW's acceptance and, after hearing of the press release received by the Item, said, \"We submitted our desegregation plan after we had amended it, and this is our first responsive reply. I have no further comment.\"\n- Paul E. Risinger has resigned as principal of Edmunds High School effective at the end of the current school year, District 17 Board Chairman John W. Godbey announced. Risinger's reason for leaving is required by the health of his parents, school authorities said, and he will return to the Columbia area to meet family responsibilities.\n- When the city of Sumter needs swan food, it turns to Kay Parnell. When Sumter School District 2 needs pencils, it calls Dave Tolson. When Sumter School District 17 needs new notebooks, Joe Klein is the man. And when Sumter County needed a new dam for Second Mill Pond, it called Bobby Galloway. Buying things for schools and municipalities isn't as easy as wandering down to the local Wal-Mart and picking it off the self, said Tolson, School District 2's finance director. Expensive items such as fire trucks and computers have to be competitively bid, and smaller items are ordered in mass quantities to save money.\n- Kris Bruton scored 25 points to lead Benedict College to a 93-83 win over Morris College in the finals of the John E. Brown Tournament Classic. Morris College's Willie Moe Davis led the scoring with 24 points, James Matthews had 14, while Allen McGill and Joe Pendergrass added 12 each.\n- Sumter native Cameron Aiken is performing the tenor lead in the University of South Carolina Opera Company's production of \"The Barber of Seville.\" \"This has been the most demanding and challenging part to date,\" said Aiken, a senior vocal performance major who has been featured in several USC opera productions over the past four years.\n- Nearly 50 years before the Pentagon lifted its ban on female combat pilots, Sumter's Jeri Crook knew what it felt like to swing her leg into the cockpit of an AT-10 and fire up the engine. She knew what it was like to pack her own parachute and hope she'd never have to use it. She knew what it was like to feel the resentment of male pilots who saw her as a threat to their jobs and an intrusion into a formerly all-male world. She knew what it was like to serve her country during war. Fifty years ago, Jeri Crook earned her wings with the Army Air Corps. Crook was one of a small, little-known group of pioneering female pilots in the predecessor of the Air Force during World War II. Only one of 25 women who applied were good enough to join the WASPS - Women's Airforce Service Pilots. One thousand women served in the Army Air Corps during World War II, a role that was then closed to women for decades to come.\n- Thomas Sumter defeated Cardinal Newman 7-0 to do its part in clinching a playoff berth, and Hammond followed that up with some assistance to put the Generals in the post-season. The Skyhawks beat Heathwood Hall 23-20 at the Hammond field to give TSA the runner-up slot in the Palmetto Athletic Conference. Thomas Sumter first-year coach Bobby Cothran said the season has been a satisfying one as his team amassed a 6-4 record.\n- The spinner baits weren't working, and the topwater plugs failed to fetch much better results. Grass beds that had produced a bounty of bass just a week earlier were proving fruitless this day. It was enough to drive the average weekend angler to distraction, but Steve Lowder is no average weekend angler. To Lowder, weekend fishing is serious business and, had this particular trip been one of his weekend forays, he might have been more upset about the lack of results. This midweek trip to Santee Cooper, though, was set up to try out a couple of newly acquired topwater lures and to accommodate a newspaper reporter who insisted that a proper interview could be conducted only on the water.\n- The western reach of Summerton's town limits comes to a halt just before Scott's Branch High School on Fourth Street, even though the center of the small, lakeside town is only several blocks away. Many black residents of Summerton, which helped give birth to the U.S. Supreme Court decision to integrate the nation's public schools, say they feel just as ostracized now as when Scott's Branch was built in 1954 as one of the state's \"separate but equal\" black schools. This time the question is about town council's refusal to annex the predominately black area beyond Scott's Branch. When petitioners from Summerton's western outskirts asked to be annexed into the town, the all-white town council said it couldn't afford it. The group would not accept council's accountant's figures. Finally, we suggested they hire an accountant. Council said the low tax base of the rejected area, combined with the high cost of garbage pickup and laying water and sewer lines, would cost each household about $230 more a year in taxes.\n- Sumter and Hillcrest both needed wins as they met in their regular season football finale at Hillcrest Memorial Stadium. The Wildcats needed a win to secure a berth in the 4A Division II state playoffs. SHS needed a win for better positioning in the 4A Division I playoffs and for head coach Tom Lewis' peace of mind. Lewis was able to sleep a little easier as the Gamecocks shut Hillcrest's offense down and finally got some positive signs from their offense in a 26-0 victory.\n- When Jerry Locklair was in elementary school, he knew exactly what he wanted to be: a famer and an artist. He planted that dream in fertile soil, and now he's both . . . sort've. \"I'm farming with my paint brush,\" he explains. But Jerry's not \"farming\" alone. He has been drawing and painting historical farm scenes for about 30 years with his wife, Dona. Today Dona and Jerry are working on a new landscape - and taking on what could be their toughest enterprise yet. That project - called simply Tanglewood by most - stands tall in a grove of Spanish moss trees in southeast Lee County near Lynchburg.", "SEOUL (THE KOREA HERALD/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - South Korea has introduced a set of measures to boost the country's chronically low birth rate, including more support for single parents and infertility treatment coverage for common-law couples.\nThe measures reflect the Moon Jae-in government's espousal of diverse forms of families, in a country where single parenthood and common-law marriages are still often stigmatised.\nThe 900 billion won (S$1.1 billion) measures, which go into effect next year (2019), were announced with statistics that showed the country's fertility rate was likely to hit a record low this year - less than 1.0 birth per woman.\nSouth Korea already saw its lowest-ever birth ate last year at 1.05 births per woman, falling below the previous record low set in 2005. The country needs a birth rate of 2.1 births per mother, to keep its population level stable at 51 million, according to the government.\n\"We believe it is important to improve the quality of life of Koreans who are in their 20s and 30s, who are either already parents or those who hope to expand their families,\" said Ms Kim Sang-hee, vice-chairman of the Presidential Committee on Ageing Society and Population Policy.\n\"We tried to create measures that could be applied to all Koreans, regardless of their economic status. We also believe it is important to embrace all kinds of families and support them,\" she said.\nAmong the newly introduced measures is the increased state allowance for single parents. Until this year, the monthly allowance was cut off once the child turned 15 years old.\nThe government is increasing the monthly allowance to 170,000 won from the current 130,000 won, and it will be given to all single parents with children aged 18 or younger. Single parents younger than 24 are eligible to receive 250,000 won monthly.\nWith the implementation of the measures next year, all unwed, single mothers will also be able to register their children with their surnames, should they wish to do so. Currently, even if an unwed mother registers her child under her surname, it would automatically change to the biological father's last name once he legally acknowledges him or her as his child.\nAlso, common-law couples who wish to have children without getting married will become eligible to get their infertility treatments covered by the national health insurance programme, starting next year.\nSouth Korea is a country where out-of-wedlock birth rate is extremely low, compared to other advanced economies, meaning unmarried people usually do not end up being parents.\nIn 2010, Korea's out-of-wedlock birth rate was 2.1 per cent, significantly lower than that of other countries, such as Norway (55 per cent) and Ireland (64.1 per cent).\nThe former Park Geun-hye administration tackled the issue rather differently.\nRather than providing support for all parents, including single mothers and unwed couples, the Park administration, as a way to boost the fertility rate, actively encouraged young people to get married by promoting ways to have \"small and affordable\" weddings and offering housing benefits for newlyweds.\n\"We aim to support all kinds of families,\" said an official from the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. \"The point is to support all mothers - and fathers - regardless of their marital status and background, and according to their specific needs.\"\nAmong other newly introduced measures is the 10-day paternity leave for fathers of newborns. Currently, three days of paternity leave are mandated.\nMedical costs for expectant mothers and babies aged zero to one will become significantly cheaper starting next year. Parents with children aged eight or younger will be able to work an hour less a day for up to two years without any wage cuts.\nEarlier this month (July), Seoul implemented a new 52-hour work week in an attempt to tackle the country's chronic workaholic culture and eventually boost the fertility rate - by encouraging Koreans to spend more time with their families.\nLast year, 357,700 babies were born in South Korea, a number which is significantly lower than the previous year's 406,200. In the 1970s, about one million babies were born annually. The government has warned that if not dealt with properly, only about 200,000 babies will be added to the population yearly before the year 2022.", "Op-Ed: Deep subprime auto loans are on the rise. Here\u2019s why you should avoid them at all costs.\nDeep subprime auto loans are becoming more prevalent, which is a troubling trend.\nBeware the subprime loan\u2014any subprime loan.\nMuch like the predatory mortgages that helped tanked the U.S. economy back in 2008; high-risk subprime and even riskier \u201cdeep subprime\u201d auto loans are causing trouble on Wall Street and, undoubtedly, wreaking havoc on consumers.\nResearchers from financial services firm Morgan Stanley found that the amount of so-called \u201cdeep subprime\u201d auto loans has been on the rise, up from 5.1 percent of subprime loans in 2010 to 32.5 percent today. Unsurprisingly, the borrowers who take these loans are falling behind their payments at a relatively fast clip, according to Bloomberg.\nConsidering more banks appear keen on handing them out, I\u2019d like to use this opportunity to caution everyone against taking out a subprime loan, be it deep, shallow or otherwise.\nSubprime loans are typically given to applicants with scores below 600 on the Fair Isaac Corp., or FICO, scale, which ranges from 300 to 850. Deep subprime loans are usually given to those who scores below 550, most of whom fall on the lower end of the income scale.\nThere's a lot that goes into a credit score, and it's not always pretty.\nBecause of the assumed risk of giving money to someone with a poor credit score, these loans often come with high interest rates, which means those with less money often have to pay more to own a car.\nThere are three major credit bureaus\u2014Equifax, Experian and TransUnion\u2014each of which has its own method for determining creditworthiness.\nImagine you\u2019re a college student strolling past a house with a trio of \u201cfrat bros\u201d sitting on the porch, waiting to weigh in on your attractiveness with cards numbered one through 10. Same basic idea, except instead of ogling your body the bureaus look at your spending history and instead of affecting your admission into a crappy keg party, your credit score determines whether you can rent or buy a home.\nAlso these credit bureaus have a troubling history of gathering inaccurate information and even saddling responsible consumers with poor scores based on the delinquency of someone with a similar name, so be sure to check your credit score early and often to make sure it\u2019s an accurate representation of you as a money-spender. If it isn\u2019t, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll have to fight like hell to get it fixed, but considering everything of real value in this world\u2014property, a college education and, yes, reliable personal transportation\u2014requires some type of financing, the extra legwork is justified.\nWhile prime auto loans are often tied to the Fed's prime rate, subprime rates are subject to more volatility.\nAll of that aside, let\u2019s assume for a moment that you\u2019ve been scored accurately, and things are not looking good. You\u2019ve racked up a ton of debts and have multiple collection claims opened against you.\nMaybe this is because you\u2019re lazy, irresponsible or amoral\u2026 though most likely, it\u2019s because you just don\u2019t have the money. Either way, your creditworthiness is bad.\nBecause of the risk you present, many banks and financial institutions will likely choose not to do business with you. Those who do will almost certainly offer you a subprime loan, also called near-prime, non-prime or second-chance loan. If you\u2019ve heard or seen advertisements from dealerships offering cars to people with little or no credit, they\u2019re probably operating in subprime territory, and therefore should be scrutinized heavily, if not outright ignored.\nBanks set their \u201cprime interest rate\u201d based on the rate set the Federal Reserve. Though this rate is subject to change throughout a given year, typically the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors likes to keep it fairly steady and adjust it based on the strength of the economy. Currently, the Fed rate is at 4 percent, so that\u2019s the baseline for prime auto loans to work around.\nSubprime rates, however, are a different story altogether. Because these rates aren\u2019t tied to a national standard, lenders have more leeway to charge as much as they please, often between 15 and 20 percent, although sometimes more. Subprime auto loans and subprime mortgages both became fashionable during the George W. Bush era, according to Investopedia.\nDuring the lead-up to the housing crisis, some people were saddled with subprime mortgages (despite actually qualifying for prime rates) and could only afford to make monthly interest rate payments, making no dent in the actual value of their property. Hence they fell behind, had to refinance and the nightmare we\u2019re all too familiar with began.\nNew cars cost about a tenth of what the average house does, so it\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison. We\u2019re talking significantly less in terms of added cost \u2013 thousands instead of tens of thousands \u2013 but that\u2019s still significant, especially for those who don\u2019t have a ton of income or savings to begin with.\nSometimes a subprime loan is unavoidable.\nFor most of us in the U.S., a car is a necessity. Even in many big cities, public transportation is spotty, unreliable or just downright unavailable in certain areas, so getting and keeping a job requires a car, preferably one you can count on. Unfortunately to get a car with a decent payment, one needs to have a job or enough money for hefty down payment. It\u2019s a classic Catch-22.\nWith the booming world of car- and ride-sharing, there are increasingly more options for getting around without owning a car and some of these services even help their drivers get into new cars, although that comes with its own set of strings. Plus, an Uber/Lyft isn\u2019t going to help you much if you have a long commute to a 9-to-5.\nFor some, a deep subprime loan on a used car might be the only option and if it is, it\u2019s not necessarily a death sentence for you or your bank account. Remember, it\u2019s not a set rate, so it is negotiable. Also, if the car helps you get a job that provides enough money to pay off the high interest loan, your credit score should improve and it\u2019s a win-win.\nJust make sure you approach the situation with eyes wide open.", "Bereavement is a difficult and emotional time for all involved.

As our correspondent reported from the euphoric final session, there was \u201cno pause, no hesitation, no time to even breathe\u201d \u2013 or register a last-minute objection \u2013 before the gavel was banged down.\nAs a declaration of intent, the agreement is impressive. But it is far too late: it would have been truly bold and timely 20 years ago. As a call to action, it is quixotic: its aspiration of a 1.5 \u00b0C cap on global warming seems almost totally unachievable (see \u201cParis climate deal is agreed \u2013 but is it really good enough?\u201c).\nNonetheless, the deal is to be welcomed. It marks the world\u2019s acceptance that climate change, driven by humans\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions, is about as close to a certainty as science can ever get \u2013 and that conclusion cannot be covered up or waved away.\nThat\u2019s a lesson we could do with learning more broadly. The Paris deal marked a rare moment of geopolitical consensus in a year that has seen the world order thrown into turmoil. Efforts to make this upset go away have led in many places to hasty attempts to redraw the contracts between states and their citizens, including a raft of impractical proposals on everything from surveillance to migration.\nThere is more turmoil to come. This year, computers repeatedly proved they could learn and excel at tasks previously considered to be uniquely human (see \u201cFrom Pluto fly-by to head transplants \u2013 the best stories of 2015\u201c). That prompted warnings that we could become redundant \u2013 or even extinct. Will machines put all but an ultra-wealthy few out of work? Or is the real problem that supposedly revolutionary digital technologies seem to have left productivity largely untouched?\nOther certainties fell by the wayside, too. The blockchain, the technology that underpins the digital currency Bitcoin, looks increasingly as though it could revolutionise aspects of society ranging from commerce to law, and certainly ownership \u2013 even as \u201csharing economy\u201d companies like AirBnB and Uber test the boundaries of civic authority and the limits of personal property.\nAt a personal level, we can\u2019t take anything for granted. On the positive side, we are on the cusp of making radical upgrades to our bodies, using everything from young blood to brain implants (see \u201cBionic eye will send images direct to the brain to restore sight\u201c). Less clear-cut are nascent techniques like gene editing, or surgical procedures such a head transplants. While these undoubtedly offer medical benefits, they also challenge time-worn ideas about bodily integrity.\nAnd on the negative side, last month brought the unwelcome news that bacteria are swapping genes that confer resistance to the \u201cantibiotics of last resort\u201d. Our modern assumption that an infection is only rarely serious is on the verge of being overturned. As with climate change, the crisis in antibiotics has been looming for decades: and yet we have carried on dazedly dispensing them like medicinal sweets to humans and fattening treats to livestock. That may cost us dearly.\nThe world is full of complexity and confusion. We cannot simply wish that noise away: we make much of it ourselves. But we can cut through it too. Science, while it can only ever deliver probabilistic and partial answers, helps us find the signals amid the noise: to reduce the uncertainties of a world continually reshaped by nature and technology.\nAnd our experience with climate shows that we can harness it even when it comes to dealing with the most complicated and contentious of issues. We just need to get better at that. Fast.", "Human-rights violations in 2009 are \u201cnumerous and varied and no sector of society is exempted,\u201d belying the Arroyo government\u2019s claim that steps have been taken to improve the Philippine government\u2019s human-rights record, according to Karapatan. And with Oplan Bantay Laya 2\u2019s deadline in 2010 fast approaching, more abuses are certain to occur, it said.\nHuman rights took a beating from the Arroyo regime in 2009, a period that saw the continuation of violations of basic rights that began to worsen ever since President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo came to power in 2001.\nIn its annual report on the human-rights situation in the Philippines between 2001 to 2009, Karapatan not only called attention to the myth of democracy in the Philippines \u2014 it also pointed to the myth of Philippine sovereignty, the myth of the rule of law under Arroyo and the myth of the existence of a government that is supposedly for the people.\nExamining the Ampatuan massacre for example, except for the large number of victims extrajudicially killed all in one day, what happened in Maguindanao last November 23 had been happening all over the Philippines for nine years now. Under Arroyo\u2019s undeclared martial law , the Ampatuan massacre was actually a \u201ccarnage waiting to happen,\u201d Karapatan said in its report.\nAs with the other human-rights atrocities recorded in the country, the Ampatuan massacre is directly traceable to the Arroyo government\u2019s \u201cblueprint for terror and impunity\u201d called Oplan Bantay Laya (OBL). A national policy that \u201cunleashes state terrorism on the people,\u201d the Arroyo government\u2019s OBL shrouded the entire country under an undeclared martial law from 2002 up to now, Karapatan said.\nUnder the Arroyo government\u2019s undeclared martial law, human-rights atrocities continuously occurred, victimizing thousands of Filipinos particularly those who are critical of Arroyo\u2019s \u201c neoliberal policies favoring big business and foreign capital\u201d and of her government\u2019s corruption, said Marie Hilao-Enriquez, chairperson of Karapatan.\nOBL aims to militarily eliminate the \u201cenemies of the state\u201d whom Arroyo and her security forces identified as not just the armed resistance movement but also the unarmed protest movement. It resulted in the government, its security forces and agencies accusing activists and protesters as members of \u201cfront organizations\u201d or sympathizers of \u201ccommunists or rebel groups.\u201d The labelling usually exposes to violence and rights abuses those who were labeled, Enriquez said.\n\u201cOplan Bantay Laya is by far the bloodiest and most brutal counterinsurgency campaign unleashed on the Filipino people by any president,\u201d Enriquez said. She said Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo \u201cfosters a reign of terror and climate of impunity that encourages her warlord minions to massacre scores of men and women, including journalists, broadcasters and two women lawyers in a gruesome carnage\u201d in broad daylight in Maguindanao.\nUnder OBL, the Arroyo government has not only relied on the police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) but also on paramilitary groups such as the Cafgu (Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit) and CVOs (Civilian Volunteers Organizations) in an attempt to end the insurgency by 2010. These paramilitary groups are placed under the supervision and control of the military. Indeed, they are \u201cbeing used by government forces,\u201d said the police in the recent Senate hearing on disarming CVOs and paramilitary groups.\n\u201cFrom the time Arroyo assumed the presidency through People Power II in 2001 and up to October 2009, there are a total of 1,118 victims of extrajudicial killings (EJK) and 204 who have been forcibly disappeared (desap) and are still missing. With the 57 victims of the Ampatuan massacre in November 23, the 2009 EJK total has surpassed those in all the years of Arroyo\u2019s rule except in 2005 and 2006,\u201d Karapatan noted in its 2009 report.\nThe years 2005 to 2006 recorded the highest number of rights violations in the decade because, as Karapatan pointed out, these were the years leading to the deadline of Oplan Bantay Laya 1. Under pressure then to meet its targets toward crushing the insurgency, the US-Arroyo regime committed the highest number of EJK, disappearances and other human-rights violations. This bodes ill for Filipinos this year and next, said Enriquez, as the OBL2\u2019s 2010 deadline looms.\nKarapatan condemned the boast of Arroyo and its \u201ckilling machine AFP\u201d that there was an \u201cimprovement\u201d in its human-rights record \u201cwhen the trend in political killings had been reduced to once a week in 2007 and 2008 from once every other day in 2006,\u201d while enforced disappearance occurred \u201conly\u201d twice a month in 2007 compared to the six cases per month in 2006.\nTo make up for \u201cde-escalating\u201d the killings and disappearances, the US-backed Arroyo regime seems to have \u201cshifted to illegal arrests which increased by 109 incidents (by 48%) in 2007 and 94 (by 42%) in 2008 compared to 2006,\u201d Karapatan said.\nCountless atrocities happened to the Filipinos\u2019 rights and welfare, many of which occurred in 2009, the year leading to the 2010 deadline of OBL2.\nHuman-rights violations in 2009 are \u201cnumerous and varied and no sector of society is exempted,\u201d belying the Arroyo government\u2019s claim, echoed by the US state department secretary Hillary Clinton, that steps have been taken to improve the Philippine government\u2019s human rights record.\nIn fact, it was this year when an \u201cunparalleled massacre happened in Ampatuan, Maguindanao.\u201d Far from just a simple election-related violence that went overboard, the massacre is clearly a direct result of the government\u2019s \u201czealous implementation of OBL\u201d because all the actors of OBL\u2019s counter-insurgency campaign, including the paramilitary groups which act as auxiliary units of the military and the police, have been tagged by witnesses as perpetrators,\u201d Karapatan said in their report.\nIt was in 2009, too, when unidentified armed men believed to be members of the military committed the seven-day abduction and torture of Filipino-American writer and activist Melissa Roxas. Despite her trauma and the threats of her erstwhile captors to her life and family, Roxas appeared in court and affirmed her testimony about her torture and how her captors had tried to force her to admit she was a member of the New People\u2019s Army.\nIn 2009, a 20-year-old teacher, Rebelyn Pitao, was \u201ckilled for her father\u2019s revolutionary zeal.\u201d Rebelyn was the daughter of Leoncio Pitao, a top NPA commander in the Davao region. Her death, according to Karapatan in Davao, signaled a shift in the military\u2019s counter-insurgency campaign, this time targeting relatives of NPA guerrillas even if they were not guerrillas themselves. There are other cases similar to Rebelyn\u2019s.\nTwo pregnant women and a child \u2014 \u201ccollateral damages\u201d in military parlance and an excuse devised by US troops who \u201cinadvertently\u201d killed unarmed civilians in other countries \u2013\u2013lost their lives in 2009 as a result of separate military operations.\nIn 2009, two activist doctors, Dr. Rogelio Penera and Dr. Bartolome Resuello, were assassinated by masked armed men in separate incidents in Davao City and Northern Samar.\nNo thanks to OBL coupled with Arroyo\u2019s insistence on her neoliberal economic programs that allow almost unhampered exploitation of the country\u2019s resources by foreign multinationals, Karapatan reported that the indigenous peoples opposed to mining have also become military targets in 2009.\nEntire communities in the Philippines fell prey to various military operations which included food restriction, forced evacuation, conscription to the CVO to help the soldiers monitor the NPA, and \u201cclearing operations\u201d for RP-US Balikatan exercises such as the one held in Sorsogon in 2009.\nEven legitimate political exercises such as an electoral consultation in Cagayan Valley were raided by suspected military men, who, armed with M16 rifles and .45 caliber pistols, barged into the sleeping quarters of representatives of peoples\u2019 organizations and partylist groups. They reportedly threatened to kill the victims and took all of their personal belongings including laptop computers, personal documents and money.\nBayan Muna partylist representative and aspiring senator Satur Ocampo said it is precisely the Arroyo government\u2019s emphasis on military victory over dissent and armed rebellion, as devised and implemented by OBL, that is behind the sorry human-rights record of the Arroyo government.\nArroyo had personally announced the OBL phase 2 and its target to \u201cfinish off all enemies of the state by 2010,\u201d Ocampo said. But by all indicators, \u201c their targets are unattainable,\u201d he said. This much had been revealed by the defense secretary at the time, Gilbert Teodoro, who justified the high budget of the defense department in past congressional hearings as needed for increasing battalions of Scout Rangers and companies of CAFGUs. Teodoro had claimed that AFP lacks manpower and arms to decisively defeat armed opponent.\n\u201cDespite the huge armed forces and undetermined number of paramilitary troops, they cannot finish off the NPA which they have constantly belittled,\u201d Ocampo said.\nArroyo\u2019s security forces and their OBL cannot defeat the insurgency and protest movement because they\u2019re not \u201caddressing the basic problems that beset the Philippine society,\u201d Karapatan said. Instead, the Arroyo government has only worsened the poverty and iniquity in the country. \u201cThe socio-economic component of OBL includes clearing the way for \u2018economic projects\u2019 which are actually multinational mining ventures, agro-industrial and other foreign and big business interest,\u201d Karapatan said.\nThe year 2009 \u201cfurther proves that president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, knowingly and willfully leads the implementation of OBL and has repeatedly exhorted the military and related government agencies to meet the brutish targets set for 2010 despite the loss of lives, liberty and security of the victims of OBL,\u201d Karapatan said in its year-end report.\n\u201cArroyo is a most prolific Frankenstein,\u201d journalist Carlos Conde said, because Arroyo has bred a lot of monsters such as the likes of the notorious Jovito Palparan , the Ampatuans and the resulting culture of impunity. Conde was invited to the launching of the report by Karapatan to present the media\u2019s perspective on human rights abuses.\nEven CHR chairperson Leila de Lima agreed that \u201cnobody would surely dispute\u201d the \u201cstate-sponsorship\u201d of the Ampatuans.\n\u2022 Abetting U.S. military intervention.\nKarapatan recommends the filing of a class suit against Arroyo here and in other countries for human rights violations and crimes against humanity. \u201cWe call for investigation of human rights violations especially extra-judicial killing, enforced disappearances and torture, and prosecution of those found accountable,\u201d said Enriquez.\nAside from pushing for indemnification of the victims of human-rights violations by the Arroyo government and their families, Karapatan also calls for promotion and protection of the rights of human rights defenders.\nEnact and strictly implement laws \u201cthat will deter would-be perpetrators and punish those guilty of human rights violations,\u201d they also said.\nKarapatan also requested the international community to \u201ccontinue to monitor the human rights situation in the Philippines,\u201d saying the government\u2019s record in it should be made a requirement in granting foreign aid, especially funds allocated for military purposes.\nUnder Arroyo, the Philippines has also been rated near or at the top of the most dangerous countries for journalists and activists. The country has likewise been rated as the most corrupt in Asia and one of the most corrupt in the world.", "FOLLOWING 23 years of distinguished service in Germany, soldiers from 6 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps have formed up on parade for the final time before a move to North Yorkshire.\nAlthough still engaged in operational commitments throughout the world, 6 Regt RLC were determined to mark the occasion, at their barracks in Gutersloh, of their end of service in Germany in style.\nAround 300 soldiers marched onto the parade square in front of their families and dignitaries from both the military and the local communities on Friday, June 17.\nCommanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Tim Crossland said: \u201cI am incredibly proud to be the Commanding Officer of 6 Regiment and to lead them off the parade square for the final time in front of all our families.\n\"It was a very proud moment but also a poignant and sad one that our time in Germany is coming to an end \u2013 we have enjoyed our time here.\nLieutenant Graham Howard added: \"We have been practicing this parade for some time as we wanted to get it right.

And that was Google Cardboard. Cardboard is an open-source DIY VR headset that works with just about any smartphone and can be built at home for around $10. And unlike Oculus, it's available right now.\nI've used Oculus and Cardboard, and I've found the VR experiences comparable. But Cardboard works with the smartphone you already have (Android or iOS), and therein lays its great promise.\nCardboard's low pricepoint makes virtual reality content available to anyone with a compatible smartphone, and at this year's I/O conference, Google announced a number of Cardboard enhancements that promise to make the platform even more accessible.\nAn updated model of Cardboard is now easier to assemble and will work with larger devices up to 6 inches. YouTube will also start hosting VR video later this summer, where it will join a bevy of already available immersive photos.\nGoogle also introduced Jump, an open-source model that utilizes 16 video cameras placed on a circular rig to capture immersive content, which can then be seamlessly stitched together with remote computing power, bringing the power of VR video creation to the masses.\nJump is a system that can be used with any digital camera, but Google specifically mentioned a partnership with GoPro to create a rig out of 16 Hero4 cameras, something GoPro showed off at the Code conference this week. Creators can then upload the various camera feeds to the remote \"Jump Assembler,\" which will use massive computing power to create seamless virtual content. Google says \"select creators will get access to Jump starting this summer,\" and the company is currently looking for volunteers, if you're interested.\nJump will take on some of the heavy lifting (in technical know-how and computing power) that was previously needed to capture VR video content. No prices have been announced\u2014for the rigs or (if any) for using the Assembler\u2014but 16 Hero4s alone will set you back about $6,400.\nThat's quite a hefty price. However, it's not entirely out of place compared to other super high-end video equipment out there. We should also keep in mind that Jump's open source model could be used with other, more affordable cameras, bringing the price down considerably.\nThis is all a new technology that will improve in quality and price point over time. Whether this will be the year that VR breaks or not (probably not), it appears that Google has started us down the path that will make virtual reality\u2014consumption and creation\u2014a reality reality.\nI'm still getting excited, at least.", "I\u2019ve never been a fan of survival or roguelike games. Having to scrounge around for items gets monotonous, as does unexpectedly dying and having to essentially start over again. The need to keep an eye on deteriorating health is annoying too. Despite this, I actually enjoyed my time with Skyhill, which is now available on Nintendo Switch. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this title isn\u2019t one I see myself coming back to, but it is a deceptively pleasant experience.\nOriginally released on Steam in 2015, Skyhill takes place in the final days of World War 3. You play as a businessman staying at the Skyhill hotel. Everything is going fine until a nuclear bomb drops and the hotel goes into lockdown. Now, you must descend from the hundredth floor all the way to the first. The catch is you\u2019ll have to survive against all manner of nasty monsters on your way down and do so while gathering useful items.\nEach floor has two rooms to enter. The floors and rooms are randomly generated, which makes it impossible to map out a route. Most of Skyhill\u2019s suspense comes from not knowing what awaits you. You\u2019re just as likely to encounter a mutated baddie as you are to find absolutely nothing. You\u2019ll eventually need to revisit the 100th floor in order to upgrade the penthouse (which serves as your base of operations). Doing this lets you rest up and gives you a nice breather. Thankfully, you continue from where you left off and don\u2019t need to go down every single floor again.\nCombat is turn-based. You can attack specific body parts on enemies but you\u2019ll have to carefully consider where to attack. For example, attacking the head deals the most damage but has a higher chance of missing. Attacking the chest has a high chance of hitting but deals less damage. If you go into a fight with nothing equipped, things will likely not end well. This means you\u2019ll need weapons like a knives or guns equipped at all times.\nPerforming actions eats away at your hunger meter. Because of that, you\u2019ll need to always have food handy. It helps that your backpack has unlimited space. Cheese and bread alleviate hunger, and combining the two items to create a sandwich keeps you fuller longer. If you have no food left, actions deplete your health. While the thought of having to constantly monitor a character\u2019s hunger sounds tedious, it\u2019s not so bad in Skyhill. It becomes second nature after a while. But it\u2019s still something players don\u2019t want to ignore.\nKilling enemies rewards you with experience points. Leveling up makes you deal additional damage and also makes you harder to kill. You gain different skills (both active and passive) when you level up. These increase your health, dexterity, speed, accuracy, and stamina. Considering how challenging the lower floors are, leveling up and assigning skills literally means the difference between life and death.\nSkyhill is a simple game in terms of its mechanics. This is a double-edged sword, however. While it\u2019s nice you don\u2019t need to memorize overly complicated features, the game can get too simplistic. Each floor only ever has two rooms. While randomized, the game does start to get repetitive. Even the bottom 50 floors are more of the same, just with less items to pick up. To be fair, this is a personal complaint since I\u2019m not generally a roguelike fan. Those who enjoy the genre will likely not get bored since there is just enough variety to keep things interesting. If you\u2019re like me, you probably won\u2019t play Skyhill for more than 20 minutes at a time.\nThe Nintendo Switch is a perfect platform for indies and Skyhill is certainly no exception to that rule. The straightforward gameplay mechanics make the roguelike and survival elements easier to swallow. It can get tiresome at times and it\u2019s difficult to play for long stretches of time. However, it is an overall well-crafted title even folks who aren\u2019t into these genres can enjoy. Skyhill makes a persuasive argument for roguelikes and survival titles and is worth trying out.", "Justin Bieber boasts to a Rolling Stone writer that he has one of the world\u2019s only black MacBooks, tying up a number of new rumors.\nBuried in the last bit of his Rolling Stone profile, Justin Bieber boastfully confirms a refreshed lineup of MacBooks that include a black edition\u2013tying up with a number of new rumors. Swag.\nSpeaking to writer Vanessa Grigoriadis, the 5\u20195\u2033, 112-pound pop waif slings around his MacAir and casually laughs \u201cmildly and then starts fiddling with his two computers, one of which he claims is the only black MacAir in the world\u201d (a partial excerpt of the interview is online).\nLast week we wondered if Intel had leaked the upcoming MacBook design in an online ad (something it\u2019s accidentally done before), and many of the details certainly tally with swelling rumors. One fact didn\u2019t chime in tune, we thought\u2013the Intel device was black, but Apple has recently moved past its history of colored computer products and centered on releasing aluminum-only editions, championing the efficiency and green qualities of the unibody machining process.\nBut to distinguish its new PCs from peers and its older models, it\u2019s highly plausible Apple could color a new line of MacBooks. One way to do this would be to anodise the metal chassis, and another way could be to swap the aluminum body for a colored alloy\u2013remembering that Apple licensed novel metal technology LiquidMetal last year.\nBieber\u2019s interview certainly adds a novel spin to this rumor \u2026 and we\u2019re wondering if the mixup with the device name (\u201cMacAir\u201d) is simply a mixup by a non-techy journalist\u2013was Bieber really toying with a pre-release MacBook Pro? And if so, why\u2013is he promoting the tech?\nWe know the MacBook range is due a refresh: The timing tallies with previous Apple schedules, Apple just refreshed its Air laptops, and these have previously led later MacBook Pro updates, and there are reports that supplies are drying up in stores. We\u2019ve conjectured that the devices would be thinner, lighter, may ditch optical drives and possibly replace hard disks with solid state drives for the purposes of speed and power efficiency (a partial SSD swap-out would make sense, as Pro-users tend to need more drive space, which would be expensive in an all-SSD solution).\nNow there\u2019s a strong rumor, based on data acquired inside Apple, that the incoming MacBooks will have SSDs as standard \u201cboot drives,\u201d for OS and application storage, and all the quick boot-ups and power-saving benefits.\nThere\u2019s also word that the mass of the laptops may have lightened by about half a pound\u2013a saving that could easily be made by ditching optical drives, and improving chassis design (or altering chassis material\u2013perhaps another hint that a novel colored alloy may be used).\nFurther hints say the computers will sport a \u201clarger\u201d trackpad. This certainly tallies with changes to the MacBook Air, but there would seem to be little room for a bigger pad on the bottom portion of a MacBook in its current format. Unless, that is, you imagine that trackpad were getting a lot wider\u2013to match with the proportions of a 16:9 aspect ratio screen.\nDigitimes, which has been somewhat accurate in its predictions in the past, is also hinting that alongside the expected MacBook refresh, a new line of iMacs may also be announced. The data comes from \u201csupply chain sources,\u201d adding an extra-official polish to the leak. And there\u2019s one extra fact: Digitimes notes \u201cchanges over the screen size\u201d have happened to \u201callow panel cutting to reach its optimization.\u201d This suggests to us that the iMacs may adopt a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio, in common to hints about the MacBook Pros, the actual update to the Air lineups and the fact that 16:9 is the HDTV format\u2013something consumers are increasingly familiar with.\nWe know Apple and Intel have been partnered for Intel\u2019s upcoming Lightpeak technology\u2013a potential successor to USB 3 that relies on fiber-optic connections for faster data sharing alongside power over traditional copper wire (even though Intel has downgraded the initial launch to a copper-only solution). There are serious rumors now that Apple may launch a novel new interface tech with its refreshed Macs. It\u2019s also recently patented a system that has an optical connection among the metal connectors in its patented MagSafe plug/socket assembly.\nMeanwhile there are continuing rumors that there\u2019s a novel new port on the upcoming iPad 2 design \u2026 one that may be compatible with a new connector type, and the rumor mill is now wondering if Lightpeak could appear on the iPad 2 too\u2013it would significantly distinguish the iPad 2 among a growing number of iPad competitors.\nThere\u2019s a report on CNN today that Apple\u2019s been in talks with record labels (alongside other online music vendors) to improve the quality of downloaded track that\u2019s typically offered.\nWhen professional studios record artists digitally they tend to use 24-bit lossless audio formats that represent an extremely high match to the actual sound waves comprising the music. This is downsampled to be compatible with CD\u2019s 16-bit technology (resulting in what\u2019s technically a poorer match to the actual original sound waves, although you\u2019d probably need to be a musical expert to note the differences) and then further downsampled and compressed into MP3s when sold through digital music stores.\nNow it seems Apple\u2019s after the actual 24-bit masters for the tracks it offers, in order to deliver truly high-fidelity recordings at what would presumably be a premium price\u2013it makes sense to keep iTunes fresh and interesting to audiophiles, and its the continuation of a policy Apple\u2019s tried before, when it doubled its music bit rate in 2009 (also ditching DRM at the same time\u2013for a price).\nTwo rumors have surfaced that Apple may be delaying both the iPad 2 and the iPhone 5.\nOne hints that production bottlenecks have slowed the iPad 2\u2019s launch from a planned April date to a rumored June date. It\u2019s possible, but we\u2019re skeptical since Apple seems to have deliberately depleted its product inventory of the iPad right now\u2013something it would only do if a refresh were imminent (think of the lost sales of millions of devices otherwise). A source close to Reuters agrees with us.\nThe other rumor suggests a \u201cJuly launch is unlikely\u201d for the iPhone 5, because some chip vendors haven\u2019t yet confirmed they\u2019re ramping up demand to meet orders for new Apple products, and other supply chain agreements are apparently still in \u201cflux\u201d. The thinking is that a September date is more likely. Again, we\u2019re skeptical about this\u2013Apple\u2019s suppliers can be very secretive, and while a few weeks delay is certainly possible we find it incredible that Apple would tolerate a slip of two months, since this could cede too much marketshare to Android.\nUpdate: Kara Swisher at AllThingsD is reporting, presumably from inside sources, that Apple\u2019s got a March 2 event scheduled to launch the iPad 2. That would quash any notion the iPad 2 is delayed, and we could easily expect it to arrive in April.", "JERUSALEM \u2013 Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to be headed toward a historic fifth term as Israel&apos;s prime minister on Wednesday, with close-to-complete unofficial election results giving his right-wing Likud and other nationalist and religious parties a solid majority in parliament.\nThe outcome affirmed Israel&apos;s continued tilt to the right and further dimmed hopes of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Re-election will also give Netanyahu an important boost as he braces for the likelihood of criminal charges in a series of corruption scandals.\nWith 97.4% of the vote counted, Likud and its traditional political allies were in command of a 65-55 majority in parliament. A couple of small parties were still teetering along the electoral threshold and fighting for their survival, so the final makeup of the next parliament has yet to be decided. In any case, the country now faces what could be weeks of political negotiations over the composition of a ruling coalition.\nThe long-time Israeli leader had fought a tight, ugly race against centrist ex-military chief Benny Gantz, whose nascent Blue and White party emerged as a viable alternative to Netanyahu&apos;s decade in power. The near-final results showed it deadlocked with Likud at 35 seats. But most of its support seems to have come at the expense of the venerable Labor and leftist Meretz parties, who both earned historic lows in Tuesday&apos;s election.\nWith a victory, Netanyahu would capture a fourth consecutive term and fifth overall, which this summer will make him Israel&apos;s longest-ever serving leader, surpassing founding father David Ben-Gurion.\n\"It&apos;s a night of tremendous victory,\" Netanyahu told supporters early Wednesday. \"I was very moved that the nation of Israel once again entrusted me for the fifth time, and with an even greater trust.\"\nNetanyahu&apos;s message of unity was a sharp contrast from his campaign theme in which he accused Gantz of conspiring with Arab parties to topple him. Arab leaders accused Netanyahu of demonizing the country&apos;s Arab community, which is about 20 percent of the population.\nBut his corruption scandals created some voter fatigue. Along with two other former military chiefs on his ticket, Gantz was able to challenge Netanyahu on security issues, normally the prime minister&apos;s strong suit, while also taking aim at the prime minister&apos;s alleged ethical lapses.\nIsrael&apos;s attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery, breach of trust and fraud in three cases. He will only decide on indicting him after a legally mandated hearing. Legal experts expect at least some charges to be filed, which could set the stage for a short term for Netanyahu and another round of elections soon.", "Pope Benedict XVI meditated on the theme of the Church in the life and thought of St. Paul in this last of his Wednesday audience series on the figure of the Apostle, on November 22, 2006.\nToday, we are ending our encounters with the Apostle Paul by dedicating one last reflection to him. Indeed, we cannot take our leave of him without considering one of the decisive elements of his activity and one of the most important subjects of his thought: the reality of the Church.\nWe must first of all note that his initial contact with the Person of Jesus happened through the witness of the Christian community of Jerusalem. It was a turbulent contact. Having met the new group of believers, he immediately became a fierce persecutor of it. He acknowledged this himself at least three times in as many of his Letters: \"I persecuted the Church of God\" (I Cor 15: 9; Gal 1: 13; Phil 3: 6), as if to describe his behaviour as the worst possible crime.\nHistory shows us that one usually reaches Jesus by passing through the Church! In a certain sense, this proved true, we were saying, also for Paul, who encountered the Church before he encountered Jesus. In his case, however, this contact was counterproductive; it did not result in attachment but violent rejection.\nFor Paul, adherence to the Church was brought about by a direct intervention of Christ, who in revealing himself on the road to Damascus identified himself with the Church and made Paul realize that persecution of the Church was persecution of himself, the Lord.\nIn fact, the Risen One said to Paul, persecutor of the Church: \"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\" (Acts 9: 4). In persecuting the Church, he was persecuting Christ.\nPaul, therefore, was at the same time converted to Christ and to the Church. This leads one to understand why the Church later became so present in Paul's thoughts, heart and activity.\nIn the first place, she was so present that he literally founded many Churches in the various cities where he went as an evangelizer. When he spoke of his \"anxiety for all the Churches\" (II Cor 11: 28), he was thinking of the various Christian communities brought into being from time to time in Galatia, Ionia, Macedonia and in Achaea.\nSome of those Churches also caused him worry and chagrin, as happened, for example, in the Churches of Galatia, which he saw \"turning to a different gospel\" (Gal 1: 6), something he opposed with grim determination.\nYet, he felt bound to the Communities he founded in a way that was far from cold and bureaucratic but rather intense and passionate. Thus, for example, he described the Philippians as \"my brethren, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown\" (Phil 4: 1).\nOn other occasions he compared the various Communities to a letter of recommendation, unique in its kind: \"You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on your hearts, to be known and read by all men\" (II Cor 3: 2).\nAt yet other times, he showed a real feeling for them that was not only paternal but also maternal, such as when he turned to those he was addressing, calling them: \"My little children, with whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you\" (Gal 4: 19; cf. also I Cor 4: 14-15; I Thes 2: 7-8).\nPaul also illustrates for us in his Letters his teaching on the Church as such. Thus, his original definition of the Church as the \"Body of Christ\", which we do not find in other Christian authors of the first century, is well known (cf. I Cor 12: 27; Eph 4: 12; 5: 30; Col 1: 24).\nWe find the deepest root of this surprising designation of the Church in the Sacrament of the Body of Christ. St Paul said: \"Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body\" (I Cor 10: 17). In the same Eucharist, Christ gives us his Body and makes us his Body. Concerning this, St Paul said to the Galatians: \"You are all one in Christ\" (Gal 3: 28). By saying all this, Paul makes us understand that not only does the belonging of the Church to Christ exist, but also a certain form of equality and identification of the Church with Christ himself.\nFrom this, therefore, derive the greatness and nobility of the Church, that is, of all of us who are part of her: from our being members of Christ, an extension as it were of his personal presence in the world. And from this, of course, stems our duty to truly live in conformity with Christ.\nPaul's exhortations concerning the various charisms that give life and structure to the Christian community also derive from this. They can all be traced back to a single source, that is, the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, knowing well that in the Church there is no one who goes without them, for, as the Apostle wrote, \"to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good\" (I Cor 12: 7).\nIt is important, however, that all the charisms cooperate with one another for the edification of the community and do not instead become the cause of a rift.\nIn this regard, Paul asked himself rhetorically: \"Is Christ divided?\" (I Cor 1: 13). He knows well and teaches us that it is necessary to \"maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call\" (Eph 4: 3-4).\nObviously, underlining the need for unity does not mean that ecclesial life should be standardized or levelled out in accordance with a single way of operating. Elsewhere, Paul taught: \"Do not quench the Spirit\" (I Thes 5: 19), that is, make room generously for the unforeseeable dynamism of the charismatic manifestations of the Spirit, who is an ever new source of energy and vitality.\nBut if there is one tenet to which Paul stuck firmly it was mutual edification: \"Let all things be done for edification\" (I Cor 14: 26). Everything contributes to weaving the ecclesial fabric evenly, not only without slack patches but also without holes or tears.\nThen, there is also a Pauline Letter that presents the Church as Christ's Bride (cf. Eph 5: 21-33).\nWith this, Paul borrowed an ancient prophetic metaphor which made the People of Israel the Bride of the God of the Covenant (cf. Hos 2: 4, 21; Is 54: 5-8). He did so to express the intimacy of the relationship between Christ and his Church, both in the sense that she is the object of the most tender love on the part of her Lord, and also in the sense that love must be mutual and that we too therefore, as members of the Church, must show him passionate faithfulness.\nThus, in short, a relationship of communion is at stake: the so to speak vertical communion between Jesus Christ and all of us, but also the horizontal communion between all who are distinguished in the world by the fact that they \"call on the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ\" (I Cor 1: 2).\nThis is our definition: we belong among those who call on the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, we clearly understand how desirable it is that what Paul himself was hoping for when he wrote to the Corinthians should come to pass: \"If an unbeliever or an uninitiated enters while all are uttering prophecy, he will be taken to task by all and called to account by all, and the secret of his heart will be laid bare. Falling prostrate, he will worship God, crying out, \"God is truly among you'\" (I Cor 14: 24-25).\nOur liturgical encounters should be like this. A non-Christian who enters one of our assemblies ought finally to be able to say: \"God is truly with you\". Let us pray to the Lord to be like this, in communion with Christ and in communion among ourselves.\nMy prayerful greetings go to all the English-speaking visitors and pilgrims present at today's Audience, including the groups from England, Malta, Japan and the United States of America. I greet especially the Salvatorian Sisters, the American Friends of the Vatican Library and the Delegation from the Association of the Order of Malta. May your visit to the city of the Apostles Peter and Paul renew your love for Christ and his Church, and may God's Blessing be upon you all.\nLastly, I greet the young people, the sick and the newly-weds. Next Sunday, the last of Ordinary Time, we will be celebrating the Solemnity of Christ the King. Dear young people, put Jesus at the centre of your life and you will receive from him light and courage in every daily decision. May Christ, who made the Cross his royal throne, help you, dear sick people, to understand the redemptive value of suffering lived in union with him. As I remind you, dear newly-weds, that this very day is the 25th anniversary of the promulgation of the Apostolic Exhortation Familiaris Consortio that encouraged pastoral care of the family in the Church, I express the hope that you will persevere on your way in marriage ever united to Christ.\nAnd at the end of this Audience in the rain, I would like to thank you all for your patience, but also to thank the Lord who has given us moments of light and a pause in the rain.\nI learned with deep sorrow the news of the assassination of the Hon. Mr Pierre Gemayel of the Ministry for Industry of the Lebanese Government. As I firmly condemn this brutal attack, I assure the bereaved family and the beloved Lebanese People of my prayers and spiritual closeness.\nIn the face of the dark forces that are seeking to destroy the Country, I invite all Lebanese not to allow themselves to be conquered by hatred but rather to strengthen their national unity, justice and reconciliation, and to work together to build a future of peace. Finally, I ask the Leaders of countries who have that Region's future at heart to contribute to a global and negotiated solution to the various situations of injustice that have now marked it for too many years.", "In March 2003, I traveled to Afghanistan to facilitate a leadership training for a group of Afghan women who were hoping to help lead their country away from the abyss that had been Taliban rule.\nAfghans I met \u2013 men and women \u2013 were grateful that the U.S. had knocked the Taliban out of power. They wanted to get an education and a job, but there were few schools and jobs available.\nThat was the moment when we might have been able to fund education and economic development to win over the hearts and minds of the Afghan people, and help build a central government capable of running the country. The U.S. had clarity of purpose and a sense of national unity for its mission.\nAfter all, Al Qaeda had launched the 9/11 attacks from Afghanistan, complete with terrorist training camps. Nearly the whole world supported our efforts to uproot Al Qaeda and to build a new and representative government in Afghanistan.\nBut the U.S. did not provide the support needed to help Afghanistan recover and rebuild. Afghans were puzzled why even then the U.S. was supporting cruel regional warlords, undermining the power of the central government we claimed to support.\nJust days after I left Afghanistan, the U.S. invasion of Iraq began. President Bush shifted attention, military force, and funds to Iraq. U.S. efforts in Afghanistan languished. President Obama wants to recapture the historic moment that was lost in 2003.\n1) The central government is too weak. People refer to President Karzai as the Mayor of Kabul because the only area he really controls is the capital. Afghanistan lacks even the basic elements of a functioning central government: it does not deliver services nationally like health care or education; it does not provide a national bank and finance system; it does not administer justice. Afghanistan is really a collection of regions, some ruled by warlords. So there will be no real central government to take over military operations in 18 months. That approach may work in Iraq, but it will not work in Afghanistan which is completely different. Iraq had a strong central government before the U.S. invaded; Afghanistan did not.\n2) The country is too corrupt. Corruption runs rampant from top to bottom. Funds intended to support military and development efforts are siphoned off by swindlers. Stealing isn\u2019t a crime so much as a way of life. The police who should be protecting citizens are part of the problem: many of them shake people down for protection payoffs. In fact, protection payoffs are a large source of revenue for the Taliban.\n3) The country has become a big heroin den. Growing and trading opium is the country\u2019s largest income source. Even people who don\u2019t like opium feel it\u2019s their best path to financial survival. So on top of political and religious feuds is a vast network of narcotics dealers.\n4) Local support for the U.S. has dramatically diminished. The current war has dragged on for eight years. U.S. and Coalition forces have driven Al Qaeda from Afghanistan and have limited Taliban efforts to return to power. In those eight years, lots of Afghan civilians have been killed and injured. Bombs that have destroyed Taliban fighting units have also inflicted \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d killing civilians. The neighbors and relatives of those dead civilians aren\u2019t likely to welcome new troops as their liberators. Many Afghans now see the U.S. as part of the problem, an occupying force.\nIn addition to the likely ineffectiveness of escalation is the certainty of its expense. At a cost of about $1 million per soldier, 30,000 more troops will cost us about $30 billion a year. This is on top of the $1 trillion we have already spent in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. government is already in debt by over $12 trillion. Every dollar we spend is borrowed money. So we\u2019re going to borrow more money to send more troops, thereby making us even more vulnerable to our creditors. Being heavily indebted to other countries is itself a threat to our national security.\nThere is another way forward. The U.S. first invaded Afghanistan to dismantle the terrorist training camps and their Taliban supporters. Mission accomplished. We can declare victory and set a new, clearly defined objective: prevent the resurgence of terrorist training camps. This objective can be met by the presence of a much smaller multilateral force. Also, more support for educating girls and women would lift families and communities while helping to reduce terrorism.\nEleanor LeCain is a Washington, D.C.,-based speaker and writer, the president and CEO of NewWayUSA, and a former Massachusetts Assistant Secretary of State.", "Australia is in for a very ugly period of politics if Prime Minister Kevin Rudd maintains his outrageous assertion that a coalition government would trigger conflict with Indonesia, opposition deputy leader Julie Bishop says.\nMr Rudd has taken issue with Mr Abbott&apos;s promise to turn back asylum seeker boats if the coalition wins government, telling reporters on Friday it could not be done given Indonesia had said it would not co-operate with such a policy.\n\"I really wonder if he is trying to risk conflict with Indonesia ... there have been some pretty rough times in the relationship, I never want to see that again,\" Mr Rudd said.\nA clearly angry Ms Bishop denounced the statement and called for the prime minister to retract it.\n\"The prime minister of this country has falsely, maliciously, recklessly, irresponsibly said that the coalition would trigger conflict with Indonesia,\" Ms Bishop told Sky on Friday.\n\"It is not out policy to breach Indonesian territorial sovereignty nor is it our policy to trigger a conflict with Indonesia.\n\"It is an utterly, utterly outrageous statement for Kevin Rudd to make.\n\"And if this is the behaviour we can expect from the prime minister within 24 hours of him being sworn in as prime minister then we are in for a very ugly period of Australian politics.\"\nMs Bishop, the coalition&apos;s foreign affairs spokeswoman, said it was a major gaff for Mr Rudd to drag Indonesia into domestic politics for his \"base\" political reasons.\n\"The man is supposed to be a former diplomat.

Of those, just over 24.5 per cent had what they described as sensitive but non-personally identifiable information (PII) taken. Just over 25 per cent of organizations victimized lost PII customer or employee information.\nThe report calculated an attack success rate. While the average number of attacks were down in 2018 compared to the year before, nearly three per cent of all types of attacks resulted in a successful exfiltration, versus 2.1 per cent of attacks resulting in a breach reported the year before \u2014 a jump of one-third.\nincidents per organization per year (versus an average of 9.33 breaches per organization in 2017).\nFirms also have organizational blind spots to risk areas, the report found, including understanding the data-flows between an organization and its third-party partners, suppliers, and vendors; knowledge of government privacy legislation; cyber security responsibilities in cloud environments including patching and updating software; and exposure to insider threats from employees or contractors.\nThe survey part of the report was conducted by IDC Canada of 407 IT security and risk and compliance professionals with at least 15 employees. Eighty-seven per cent of the IT security respondents were at a supervisor level or higher.\nTo gauge security readiness and cyber resilience respondents were asked questions around aspects of the NIST cyber security framework.\n\u2013the average cost per organization of responding to and recovering from cyber security incidents increased significantly from $3.7 million last year, to between $4.8 million \u2013 $5.8 million this year.\nOne of the more alarming findings: Time to recovery is increasing.\nHere\u2019s another: Of the survey respondents, 8.4 per cent indicated that it took them longer than a month to patch an aspect of their IT environment. Over 90 per cent of these respondents understood the risks associated with unpatched IT environments, with 59 per cent unable to update/patch faster due to IT and business reasons. \u201cOf greater concern, one third of these respondents indicated that they were aware of the risks they were exposing their organization to but were willing to take these risks or had no particular reason why they didn\u2019t patch or update sooner,\u201d said the report.\nOne of the more revealing findings: Organizations that follow fundamental cyber resilience practices spend an average of 16.1 staff work days recovering from cyber security breaches per year versus 20.5 days for organizations that do not.\nWho is being realistic? Year over year, says the report, there\u2019s been a very large increase (22 per cent) in the confidence of smaller organizations of their ability to prevent cyber security breaches from happening. Perhaps that\u2019s because small organizations are putting more resources into cyber security.\nOn the other hand, the report found the confidence of medium/large, and enterprise-sized organizations dropped significantly compared to last year.\nOrganizations have to do regular threat assessments, create a cyber resilience plan and keep it up to date and practice cyber security fundamentals, the report concludes.\nScalar Decisions was recently bought by CDW Canada.\nClick here to read the full report.

In the entire state of Florida, only one restaurant made the cut: Bern's Steak House.\nA nearly 60-year-old Tampa legend, Bern's was named a finalist in the Outstanding Wine Program category.\nWith what is said to be the largest restaurant wine list in the country, Bern's will compete against two restaurants in Charleston, S.C., (FIG and McCrady's) and two in California (A16 in San Francisco and Spago in Beverly Hills).\nOwner David Laxer credits his wine team \u2014 Brad Dixon, Eric Renaud and Josh Michael Shields \u2014 but much of the honor goes to his father, restaurant founder Bern Laxer, who died in 2002. \"It goes back even before us because we still have many of the wines my father purchased that we're able to offer to diners. That's the foundation of our list, what he built over the years.\"\nAs Bern's public relations director Brooke Palmer explains, putting together a world-class wine list is more complicated than merely purchasing. Because it is illegal for a restaurant to buy aged wines at auction from private collections, a restaurant must have the forethought and space to purchase great wines young and cellar them appropriately until they are ready to be drunk.\n\"Two days a week (the wine team) goes over and spends time in the warehouse. It's the Home Depot of wine. There's so much in there that they are constantly discovering things. They have such intimate knowledge of our collection.\"\nLast year Bern's nabbed a semifinalist nomination for Outstanding Restaurant, but failed to make the finalist cut. The only year Bern's, or any Tampa Bay restaurant, won a James Beard award was in 1992 when Bern's Steak House sommelier Derrick Pagan won for wine service.\nTechnically, Tampa Bay is in the running in a second category this year: St. Petersburg's Locale Market co-owner Michael Mina was named a finalist in the Outstanding Restaurateur category, largely on the strength of his Mina Group's 26 restaurants around the country. In addition, the Mina Group's Rajat Parr was named a finalist in the Outstanding Wine, Beer or Spirits Professional category. Parr was instrumental in Locale's beverage program.\nGreg Baker of Tampa's Refinery and Fodder & Shine did not make the finalist cut this year. He had once again been Tampa Bay's best hope, scoring his fourth James Beard Foundation semifinalist nod for Best Chef: South. (The Refinery received a nomination in 2011 for Best New Restaurant in the United States.) Otherwise this area was shut out, and Florida had zero contenders in the big categories (Best New Restaurant, Outstanding Restaurant, Outstanding Chef, etc.).\nLaxer, who aims to attend this year's awards ceremony May 4, hosted by Alton Brown and held at Lyric Opera of Chicago, thinks Florida has made great gastronomic strides in recent years. But he says that the state may suffer from a perception problem.\n\"Maybe people still consider Florida a touristy destination, not for serious dining. But just looking at the local scene, and also that in Orlando, Jacksonville and other parts of Florida \u2014 there are amazing things going on in our state.\"\nFor a list of this year's finalists, go to jamesbeard.org.", "Of an Indonesian workforce of more than 160 million people in 2016, as many as 40 percent were millennials \u2013 62.5 million \u2013 and almost 50 percent were generation X \u2013 one of the biggest such cohorts in the world today, according to Indonesia\u2019s Central Statistics Agency (BPS).\nThis population configuration, dominated by young people will run the Indonesian labor market over the next few years. Exposed to technological advances from an early age and with higher education participation rates, the millennial workforce tends to be more open-minded, highly creative with an entrepreneurial spirit, and puts forward the values of freedom and flexibility when working.\nIn terms of industry, both local and multinational companies in Indonesia are competing to continue to improve the quality of their workers because superior, talented human resources are what it takes for a business to succeed. Thus increasingly a knowledge-based workforce is vital to deliver a company\u2019s mission. This is when the recruitment process is essential as it opens the gate for future employees to enter. This door is the initial opportunity for firms to attract high-quality individuals.\nBut too many Indonesian companies have been slow on the uptake of what motivates millennials to come to work for them. Somewhat surprisingly, salary, compensation and employee involvement have less influence on turnover intentions among millennials than other factors.\nThe rising number of undergraduate and postgraduate degree-holders may be one of the principal reasons to explain this change. These educated graduates are not only very competitive but are also well-informed. The majority are techno-literate. In 2018 Indonesia was ranked the 6th largest country in the world in terms of the number of internet users.\nAccustomed to learning values that drive them to want to be beneficial to society, these highly qualified individuals possess distinct principles and norms. Some are idealists, making them take only job offers seriously from firms whose values fit their own. Young workers aspire to build their careers with companies that pay more attention to environmental, ethical, and social issues. These individuals wish to be part of something meaningful, to actively participate in jobs that bring about a positive impact to wider society through their work.\nJana Salim, a recent graduate from an American university, said that \u201calthough revenue growth and profit margins are substantial, the way companies achieve their business mission is now becoming of great importance to us.\u201d It is important, she said, to see how a company accomplishes its goals within the framework of legal requirements and to follow ethical rules of the society\u2019s appropriate behaviour.\nMillennial applicants tend to give high ratings to energy-efficient and nature-friendly companies. Promoting green campaigns as part of their work culture, investing in energy-saving technology, Salim said, using less paper, and replacing plastic bottles with reusable tumblers in pantries can be seen as small yet appealing work policies.\nThere seems to be a universal perception among potential employees about the degree to which a company is held in high esteem. Past practices and future prospects in ensuring social responsibility speak for their overall appeal to all major constituents in comparison to other leading rivals.\nYounger workforces are attracted to companies involved in various activities aimed at improving society\u2019s well-being while maintaining community relationships. They see these firms as unselfish and philanthropic, thus fostering talented applicants to pursue employment. They expect organizations to pay attention to their values. Before actually applying, job seekers evaluate how much their beliefs would be catered to once they are hired.\nSalim said she wouldn\u2019t spend time on a job she doesn\u2019t love or be dedicated to an employer whose work values don\u2019t adhere to the values they reflect, despite being offered a high paycheck.\nAssessing the social and ethical aspects of a prospective firm is very difficult, especially for those who are not yet part of the company. However, the CSR and sustainability reports issued companies often become a public reference. This is because CSR is a reflection of a firm\u2019s conduct in terms of social, ethical, and philanthropic aspects that can be accessed, monitored and felt directly by the public.\nWe can see how powerful CSR initiatives can benefit a firm\u2019s reputation by looking at Sampoerna\u2019s access to clean water and women empowerment programs that won Best Workplace Practices Award, Best Community Program Award, and Empowerment of Women Award in the World Renowned Global CSR Summit & Awards last April although it must be acknowledged that Sampoerna is one of the country\u2019s biggest manufacturers of tobacco products, which are increasingly regarded as poisonous.\nMeanwhile, PT Astra Agro Lestari Tbk won the main award at the CSR awards with the title platinum for its CSR program which covers economic empowerment of the community, education, health, and the environment. Acquiring such renowned titles, both firms will likely be enjoying the good image and trusted reputation for years to come, especially in the eyes of young individuals.\nEmployee development \u2013the chance to move up in the corporate hierarchy and career development are more important, as is the perception that a better job may be available elsewhere.\nEmployers can increase job satisfaction through organizational commitments, a better work culture and career development.\nAs the technology sector has developed, differences have grown in the ways companies approach job seekers. Recruitment is a measure of the success of human resources departments. Finding and keeping high-caliber candidates demands that HR departments be smarter and actively create job content and form quality company branding.\nAs a result, the strategies many Indonesia companies follow in attracting potential applicants have dramatically changed over recent years, especially with the changing circumstances of young individuals. This workforce is different from its predecessors, who could be satisfied solely with solely competitive compensation schemes that used to be very prominent years ago.", "JAMES McARTHUR will use Wigan\u2019s shock FA Cup Final victory to \u00adinspire Scotland against the auld enemy at \u00adWembley tonight.\nMidfielder McArthur says the Scots have always relished the underdogs tag, just as Wigan did when they humbled moneybags Manchester City in May.\nRoy Hodgson\u2019s England are firm favourites to win the first meeting between the two countries for 14 years.\nBut McArthur has warned the Scots are ready to pounce if there is any hint of complacency in the home camp.\n\u201cScotland are always at their best when seen as the underdogs,\u201d he said, speaking at an event for Vauxhall, the Scotland team \u00adsponsor.\n\u201cIn the FA Cup Final, Wigan were the underdogs against City and look what happened. \u00adScotland will be the \u00adunderdogs against England but I\u2019m dreaming of the unthinkable \u00adhappening again.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mind being the \u00adunderdogs. In fact, we relish it. Historically, we are at our best when we are said to have no chance.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t expect us to compete with the bigger nations but we seem to do OK.\nThe Scots underlined McArthur\u2019s point by beating Croatia in Zagreb in June to give Gordon Strachan his first \u00adcompetitive win as the national side\u2019s manager, when all the odds were stacked against them.\nNow McArthur says they want to build on that with a good result against England, though they can\u2019t qualify for next \u00adsummer\u2019s World Cup finals in Brazil.\nHe added: \u201cIt was a great result for us in Zagreb. Everyone was saying we had no chance.\n\u201cCroatia\u2019s manager Slaven Bilic had a bit of a go as well before the game. As I said, it is good to prove people wrong.\n\u201cThat win gave the country a bit of pride again because everyone was downcast before that.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t qualify for Brazil now but what we can do is improve our FIFA ranking in the \u00adremaining qualifiers.\n\u201cWe were 74th before the Croatia game and, for a proud footballing nation like Scotland, that\u2019s not good enough. We\u2019re better than that.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re up to 48th but we should be in the top 20 or 30.\n\u201cThe only way to do that is to start stringing some victories together. And beating England would give us tremendous momentum.\nSome players can go through their careers without ever \u00adplaying at Wembley.\nBut, if selected, McArthur is set for his fourth outing there in just five months, following Wigan\u2019s appearances in the FA Cup semi-final and final plus Sunday\u2019s Community Shield.", "Scotland\u2019s council leaders have backed the call for a People\u2019s Vote on Brexit, warning a \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario could prove damaging to local services and cause an increase in poverty.\nMs Evison said Cosla campaigned for Remain during the EU referendum and was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about the current situation, after a meeting of councils leaders in Edinburgh yesterday.\n\u201cA big hit on our economy will mean an increase in local poverty, fewer resources locally to plan and deliver our services, no structured programme to support our local economies and real threats to all aspects of our import and export trade,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that we must not end up with a no-deal by default.\n\u201cA no-deal would cause real pain in communities right across Scotland, so all politicians have to come forward and do the right thing \u2013 and that includes the UK Parliament on 11 December.\nThe second referendum has the support of the Scottish Government, with Nicola Sturgeon calling on Labour to get behind the campaign. But it has been ruled out by the UK Government, which says such a move would undermine the democratic decision taken by voters in 2016.\nScotland for a People\u2019s Vote campaign leader John Edward also welcomed the announcement.\n\u201cThe momentum for a People\u2019s Vote is building and the support of council leaders the length and breadth of Scotland is welcome and extremely encouraging,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOver the coming days, all MPs must ask themselves: Is the Withdrawal Agreement better than the deal we\u2019ve already got inside the EU?\nNearly 70 per cent of Scots would vote to remain in the EU if a People\u2019s vote was held \u2013 a significant rise in support since the 2016 referendum, polling this week showed. And across Great Britain as a whole, a clear majority (56 per cent) would now vote to remain, an increase from 49 per cent last time, according to research for Best for Britain and HOPE not hate.\nFormer Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said the decision \u201csends a very powerful message from Scotland\u2019s local authorities\u201d.", "The actor who played Sammy \"Zammo\" McGuire in Grange Hill in the 1980s is to return to our screens as a new character in EastEnders.\nChild star Lee MacDonald, who's now 50, rose to fame more than 30 years ago as the loveable Zammo, a character who later ran into drug problems.\nMacDonald will appear on the BBC One soap in two episodes this spring.\nHe'll play a bus driver, who takes on Mick Carter - played by Danny Dyer - in a radio competition to win gig tickets.\nMacDonald, who after subsequent small roles in The Bill and Birds of a Feather, quit acting to run a south London locksmith and key-cutting firm, said: \"I am absolutely chuffed to bits and so excited to be briefly joining the cast of EastEnders.\n\"I can't say too much yet but watch this space. Top banana!\"\nIn 1986, MacDonald was involved in one of the most memorable scenes in children's TV history.\nThis was after Zammo, who had previously overdosed on heroin in the back room of the amusement arcade where his friend Roland worked, came back to school - apparently clean - but was caught by friends trying to hide drugs in a toilet cistern.\nThe storyline was intended to warn children off substance abuse and as part of the campaign the cast of the show also had a top five UK chart hit with their anti-drugs charity track, Just Say No.\nThe Grange Hill gang were then swiftly invited to the USA to perform the LaToya Jackson cover at the Yankee Stadium in New York. They were even praised by then US First Lady Nancy Reagan on a trip to the White House.\nAfter decades out of the spotlight, MacDonald appeared on the BBC's Celebrity Scissorhands and in a child stars edition of Pointless Celebrities.\nReacting to the news of his return, TV critic Emma Bullimore tells the BBC that while the name Zammo may mean nothing to younger viewers, the inclusion of an \"absolute '80s icon\" in another of the nation's best-loved shows will be of great interest and excitement to older ones.\n\"I think it's difficult if you weren't around at that time to think now about how big a kids TV programme could be,\" says Bullimore.\n\"Now we live in an age of Netflix and all these different channels and so many choices, but when you had only a few channels, ratings for shows used to be so much bigger and the most popular character within a huge show was an real icon and someone that people really cared about and got excited about seeing on TV.\n\"It's going to be a massive nostalgia trip for that generation to see that actor grown-up and being in another classic show.\"\nThe fictional path from Northam to Walford has been a fairly well-trodden one for actors down the years, but Bullimore believes the length of time between MacDonald's two big roles adds greater significance.\n\"Grange Hill and Byker Grove were both massive at the time and spawned loads of people that went on to be in big shows,\" she adds.\n\"So loads of people we were familiar with as kids then became part of shows we watched as adults.\nLee MacDonald and Erkan Mustafa on playing Zammo and Roland in Grange Hill.\n\"It was kind of like Grange Hill was a training ground for EastEnders in a way, but it's a slightly different case with Zammo as there's been a big gap.\n\"I think he hasn't been doing that much acting - a few bit parts here and there - and certainly sounds like he's excited to be back and it'll be interesting to see if he's going to do any more.\"\n\"It's supposed to be for a couple of episodes, although in soap history we've seen many [one-off] episodes lead to more.\"\nAs Zammo prepares to go on the buses, let's take a quick look back at a few of the other Grange Hill kids who went on to became regulars in the Queen Vic.\nYoung Tully played Grange Hill schoolgirl Suzanne Ross for three years in the early '80s, before leaving the show to go to college (or so she thought).\nIn 1985, however, at the age of 17, she secured the role of Michelle Fowler in the then brand new soap opera EastEnders, where she would remain until 1995.\nHer character became pregnant at the age of 16 after having an affair with \"Dirty\" Den Watts.\nTully returned to Walford in the director's chair for 12 episodes in the late '90s but she repeatedly turned down offers to reprise her role as Michelle, which was eventually recast with Jenna Russell in 2016.\nCarty arrived on screens in Grange Hill in 1978, playing the rebellious Tucker Jenkins.\nHe was one of the few characters to get his own spin-off show in the form of Tucker's Luck, which followed him from his unruly school days to the dole queue.\nIn 1990, Carty took over the role of Susan Tully's on-screen brother Mark Fowler in EastEnders. His casting followed the death of the original actor, David Scarboro.\nHis character was diagnosed with HIV, and died off-screen in 2004.\nActor turned R&B singer Gayle first came to public attention in Grange Hill as Fiona Wilson, who was one half of the school's rap duo Fresh 'n' Fly.\nA few years later, she took on the role of Hattie Tavernier in 'Enders.\nThe Taverniers were the first black family to join the soap at the same time.\nHattie worked as Ian Beale's personal assistant in the show, and also suffered a miscarriage after her fianc\u00e9 Steve abandoned her.\nClearly not over Fresh 'n' Fly, Gayle quit the soap in 1993 to pursue a full-time career in music, where she went on to score seven UK top 40 singles. Her highest-placed tune, pop pickers, was 1994's Sweetness - which peaked at number four.\nAnd finally, who could forget Sean Maguire?\nHe played \"Tegs\" Ratcliffe in Grange Hill from 1988 to 1992.\nIn EastEnders though, he became Aidan Brosnan, a young Irish footballer playing for the fictional Walford FC.\nMaguire left the show (and the team) to take on the starring role in another BBC drama series, Dangerfield, in 1994.\nHe recently had a recurring role in the long-running ABC series Once upon a Time, taking over the part of Robin Hood from Miranda star and former EastEnders doctor Tom Ellis.", "The online premiere last month of a Black Panther animated series was an exciting event for diehard comic geeks. The Panther, the first black superhero from Marvel, inspired me as a young comic fan. Now, all grown up with academic credentials to justify my comic habit, I can see the good and the bad in the new \"motion comic\" (a 21st century way to say cartoon). Moving it off the printed page and into animation is an important benchmark, but I'm concerned about its solely digital presentation.\nIn the 1960s, the Panther's debut \u2014 in Fantastic Four comics \u2014 marked a historic push for diversity. Marvel always courted diverse readers with its hip, inclusive style, but African Americans were largely absent from its pages until 1966, when the Black Panther changed everything. T'Challa (the Panther's real name), king of Wakanda and defender of its people, was for many African Americans the first positive depiction of a black person they remember in comics (not the first African American but the first black person).\nCreated by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, T'Challa was educated in the West and more concerned with protecting his homeland from outside threats than battling crime. Indeed, his costume isn't a costume; instead, his kingly robes serve to mark him as a hero. Moreover, he leads a technologically advanced African nation never conquered by whites. The Panther's origins, wealth and motivation represent a subtle acknowledgement of the destructive nature of white interaction with Africa.\nThe Panther's creation reflects the 1960s zeitgeist, but it has nothing to do with another icon of the era, the Black Panther Party. In fact, the editors once tried to change the character's name to Black Leopard after the party gained prominence.\nOver the years, Marvel's artists and writers used the Panther to address racism, colonialism and segregation in memorable story lines, first as one of the Avengers and then as a solo comic hero. In \"Panther's Rage,\" T'Challa struggles to protect his country from a devastating coup, and in \"Panther's Quest,\" he clashes with South African authorities during apartheid.\nInitially Marvel promised the Black Panther animation to BET, the Black Entertainment Network. BET has been criticized for not providing positive images, but it remains a media outlet closely linked to the African American audience. That partnership would have allowed the Panther to inspire a new generation of black youngsters and raised the comic's profile, perhaps opening the door to the big screen. Switching the series to online-only instead, via iTunes, Xbox LIVE, Microsoft Zune and PlayStation Network, undercuts its social impact.\nI realize many people dismiss concerns about the digital divide; recent research shows online growth regardless of income, ethnicity or race. Though that may be true, the nature of that access is not equal. Upper- and middle-income people have greater higher-quality access than their low-income counterparts. Thus, though low-income users (many of whom are minorities) might be online in greater numbers, what they can do and see with their access is not equal to their better-off counterparts.\nIn the end, I think the full benefit of the positive portrayal of a black superhero is limited by a digital distribution strategy. It might seem passe to think we need easy access to an imaginary black hero in the era of a real-life African American president, yet I don't think that is the case. The Black Panther has a long history of inspiring comic readers, black and white, to change the way they think about blackness, and there are plenty of signs that more change is needed.\nI know that a digital release maximizes potential benefits for Marvel. No DVDs to manufacture, ship or store, and minimal profit-sharing with a distributor. Yet, given the symbolism a black hero can have, let's hope Marvel pushes for wider release so that everyone gets the chance to be inspired by his deeds.\nJulian Chambliss is an associate professor of history at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla.", "Naples-based manufacturer Pelican Wire, recently named a Manufacturer of the Year in Florida, continues to expand.\nAfter growing up in the business, Ted Bill continues to grow Pelican Wire, a manufacturing company founded by his parents nearly 50 years ago.\nThe company \u2014 started in a garage by Larry and Theresa Bill to make high-quality custom wire \u2014 relocated from Hebron, Illinois, to Naples in 1975. Since then the company has grown by leaps and bounds.\nThe local headquarters, which includes a manufacturing plant, has expanded from 2,400 square feet to more than 30,000 square feet.\nThere's a need for more room, more machines and more employees to meet growing customer demands, said Ted Bill, the company's CEO.\n\"We're going to look for opportunities to expand. This factory is starting to get kind of tight for us,\" he said.\nPelican Wire has enough land to expand its headquarters to 50,000 square feet. However, Bill is unsure whether he'll grow the company where it's at or go somewhere else, possibly in Lee County.\nThe company struggles to find enough workers in Collier County because it's such an expensive place to live and many of its employees commute from neighboring Lee County, from such areas as Cape Coral and Lehigh Acres, where housing is a little more affordable.\nA new machine sits idle because the company can't find enough people to keep it running.\n\"I would prefer to stay in Collier County,\" Bill said. \"But sometimes you have to go where the workers are.\"\nPelican Wire specializes in thermocouple wire and resistance wire. The custom wire is used in everything from airplanes to EKGs.\nPelican Wire has hundreds of customers and about 14,000 different Skus for all the products it has developed over the decades.\nMany of the products are used for electrical heating and temperature measurement. For example, its wiring is used to heat floors in colder climates.\n\"Everything we do here is highly customized. Most of our products they are made for specific customers,\" Bill said.\nIn September the Manufacturers Association of Florida named Pelican Wire the state's Manufacturer of the Year for a second time in five years. More than 50 nominees competed for the award this year.\n\u201cThe application process is very thorough, and our judge\u2019s criteria touches almost every aspect of a business including company culture, measurable growth and responsible resource management, to name a few. To win this award is truly a distinction of excellence,\" said Amanda Bowen, the manufacturing association's executive director, in a news release announcing Pelican Wire as the winner.\nWinning the award twice in five years is unusual, \"a feat accomplished by less than a handful of companies across the the state of Florida,\" she said.\nInvolved in the family business since childhood, Ted Bill recalls what the early days were like at Pelican Wire.\n\"I worked here all through high school,\" Bill said. \"When my friends were going off to football practice or band practice I was working here \u2014 doing whatever needed to get done.\"\nBill remembers when the business had just a few employees. Now there are more than 150 in Naples and Colorado, where Pelican Wire acquired Greeley-based competitor Rubadue Wire in 2014.\nIn 2015, Pelican Wire's holding company purchased Kerrigan-Lewis Wire Products, a specialty wire manufacturer based in Chicago, and moved its manufacturing operations to Colorado. The investment allowed Pelican Wire to expand into the Litz wire market.\nA few months ago, Pelican Wire acquired a piece of the Serve-Rite insulated thermocouple manufacturing business from Watlow Electric, a global technology and manufacturing business. The sale included machinery, design and manufacturing process information and customer data.\nPelican Wire quietly goes about its business at the White Lake Corporate Park off Shaw Boulevard. The headquarters are near exit 101, off Interstate 75.\nDuring a recent tour of the plant, Bill showed off state-of-the art machines \u2014 and the people that keep them going. It's a 24-7 operation five days a week, with employees working in shifts to produce Pelican Wire's many products.\nThere were spools of wire in every direction at the plant. Machines twisted wire, colored wire, braided wire and insulated wire.\nEmployees looked over finished products with a fine-tooth comb to ensure quality. Everything is checked for quality at every point in the manufacturing process.\nIn some cases one operator can run a bank of machines. Still, the manufacturer doesn't have enough of them.\nMany of the employees are engineers.\n\"Every day there's something new, something different we have to work with,\" Bill said.\nPelican Wire has attracted some new employees through an internship program. The company hires one or two interns a year, and several of them have stayed on, including one who now heads up the engineering department, Bill said.\nThe company has four open manufacturing positions, Bill said, and it recently hired five machine operators, who are still in training, and it's still not enough.\nPelican Wire became a 100 percent employee-owned company shortly after co-founder Larry Bill died in 2008. Ted Bill returned to the company and led the effort to create an employee stock ownership plan after his father became ill.\nThe ESOP program allows employees to earn shares over time and get paid for those shares when they retire.\n\"It's a great benefit for an employee,\" Bill said. \"It was also a great transition for us, for myself and my mother. It allowed us to sell the company to itself.\"\nAfter leaving Naples for college, Ted Bill didn't think he'd return to his family's business. He earned a bachelor's degree in theater out of state before getting a master's in business administration from the University of Central Florida and going to work for Disney in Orlando. He worked as an industrial engineer and in business processes for Disney for 13 years before returning to Pelican Wire.\nPelican Wire doesn't get visitors often, but when it does they're often surprised by what they see.\nState Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, didn't know much about the company until she was invited to its celebration for winning the Manufacturer of the Year award. She said she was impressed.\n\"I was just awed by how, first of all, they are employee-owned,\" she said. \"There is such a collegiality there.\"\nShe said the employees seemed to be part of one big, happy family, from the top of the organization to the bottom. She talked to a grandfather raising a granddaughter on his own, who told her his co-workers at Pelican Wire were his family now after losing his wife and daughter.\n\"I didn't realize the business itself, they provide wire for companies all over the world \u2014 and they are just in little quiet Naples,\" Passidomo said.\nShe'd love to see more companies like Pelican Wire plant themselves in Collier County, she said.\n\"They are really a shining example of what we want in this community,\" Passidomo said, \"clean technology, clean manufacturing.\"\nIn an email, Donald Owens, a retired marine who works in production control at Pelican Wire, said he likes working for the company because of the people.\nHe's been with Pelican Wire for almost 25 years, starting in January 1994. He's had various jobs including working as an expeditor to make sure materials efficiently moved from one section to another of the plant to produce the final products and get them shipped out.\n\"There is plenty of opportunity for advancements here at Pelican Wire,\" Owens said.\nAs the company has grown, so have Owens' responsibilities.\n\"Pelican Wire is a company that will hire personnel and train them, which is a good thing, and now it is employee owned,\" he said.\nMichael Dalby, president and CEO of the Greater Naples Chamber of Commerce, said his group has worked with Pelican Wire on several of its expansion projects.\nPelican Wire's leadership and the chamber are part of a consortium that's looking for ways to improve workforce training for the manufacturing industry in Collier County. With the passage of a one-cent sales tax in the county, there's a proposal to use $20 million to build a workforce training center that could benefit companies such as Pelican Wire.\nDalby said he'd hate to see Pelican Wire move from Collier County.\n\"They're a good company, a growing company,\" he said.", "IT TAKES concentration to follow this triple play of trouble among our public officials, but the irony quickly becomes evident as the gaudy melodrama unfolds. It's so daft that it could wind up as a television soap opera.\nThe first character: Sheriff Richard Wille of Palm Beach County, who is under a criminal investigation ordered by Gov. Bob Graham. Leading that investigation is. . .\nThe second character: State Attorney Robert E. Stone, who prosecutes cases in Martin, St. Lucie, Okeechobee and Indian River counties. Stone recently was fined $1,000 after pleading guilty to leaving the scene of an accident.\nThe fine was levied by. . .\nThe third character: St. Lucie County Judge E.P. DeFriest, who heard the case against Stone after two Indian River County judges excused themselves because of possible conflict of interest.\nDeFriest won't be a judge much longer. He resigned, effective in December, after being accused of judicial impropriety.\nAn isolated case of interlocking troubles? Well, not quite.\nConsider this double play, which is simpler drama and requires less concentration.\nThe first group of characters: All those police officers in Florida who are accused of misdeeds and who must go before the state's Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission where they face possible decertification. That means they couldn't be Florida police officers any longer.\nThey will be judged by. . .\nThe next character: Seminole County Sheriff John Polk, who recently paid a $50 fine for a misdemeanor charge of gambling. He apparently lost $300 in blackjack games at a barbecue in Volusia County.\nPolk is one of 17 commission members who judge the fitness of police officers to continue in their jobs. One officer was decertified not long ago for violating the state gambling laws.\nThese homespun dramas don't qualify as morality plays, and the world of theater doesn't have a category called immorality plays. So perhaps these fit into the American soap opera genre, either the daytime or prime-time variety.\nAs Florida Turns doesn't seem right. Neither does Days of Our Misdeeds. Actually, Florida Vice could be best.\nTo pick the cast would be a daunting task, but not impossible. As Sheriff Wille, Charles Bronson is the obvious choice. He's taciturn, rough hewn and his screen characters aren't overly concerned about boundaries of behavior.\nIf Bronson can get along with police dogs and developers, he'd be a splendid Wille.\nFor State Attorney Stone, a distinguished-looking, silver-haired and imposing actor would be best. He would need to be flawed, but good at concealing it.\nA younger Robert Young would have done well. After all, he played the marvelous Dr. Welby but in real life was tormented by personal problems.\nSen. Fritz Hollings of South Carolina would look the part, but his only flaw seems to be a thick southern accent. Well, maybe Paul Newman.\nFor Judge DeFriest, the actor who plays the judge in Night Court simply won't do. One must maintain at least the facade of dignity. Orson Welles? No, E.G. Marshall would be better at portraying surface dignity.\nFor the second TV episode, a couple of police officers -- one honest and one not -- should bring their cases to the decertification commission. Impeccable Daniel Travanti of Hill Street Blues wins the role of the accused but honest cop.\nFor the bad one? Seedy Jack Nicholson would fit like a flat foot in a cop's shoe.\nAnd to play Sheriff \"Blackjack\" Polk of Seminole County? Burt Reynolds, of course. He's a good ol' Floridian who in the movies often deliberately pours beer on the law.\nReynolds would hardly have to study how to portray a card player at a Florida barbecue.\nThat's the cast, except there's something or someone missing. A TV series without a female lead would never pass the pilot stage.\nNo one could match Joan Collins for this series, no matter what role was concocted for her, because her real-life sense of personal class matches the real stories presented here.", "In November 2015, the Colorado Water Plan set a framework for the state's water conservation, quality and storage future. The new overseeing director now believes its originally estimated cost of $20 billion has at least doubled for full implementation.\nWhen the Colorado water plan was formally adopted in November 2015, its aims were lofty: expand storage capacity on a grand scale, bolster conservation efforts, meet agricultural demands and provide for as many as 10.5 million people by 2050. At the time, it was estimated to cost around $20 billion. Even then, the number seemed staggering.\nYes, you read that correctly \u2014 the price has doubled. New estimates released this month suggest that full implementation of the water plan will cost roughly $40 billion.\nIn 2013, Gov. John Hickenlooper tasked the Colorado Water Conservation Board with coming up with the plan and then-director James Eklund came up with his best approximation on the overall expense. New board director Becky Mitchell, in the position since early-July, recently took her own stab at the total, though, and believes full implementation to be closer to twice Eklund\u2019s figure.\nMessages left with Mitchell went unreturned Monday. But she spoke with the Colorado Independent last week and addressed the considerable miscalculation.\nDespite the possible sticker shock, water experts aren\u2019t dissuaded by the new ballpark figure, realizing that any of these proposed projects would come at heightened costs.\nRegardless of whether it turns out to be as much as $40 billion \u2014 or more, given inflation and additional projects pinpointed in the future \u2014 the question remains: Where will the money come from?\nFollowing the request of the state water conservation board, Colorado\u2019s General Assembly identified $10 million during its last legislative session. The money is intended for completing a few basic projects listed in the water plan, ranging from increased storage to those with an environmental bent or working with the agriculture industry to uncover results.\nOther ideas for financing projects floated within the plan include possible water container taxes, water bill surcharges or bonds and additional statewide revenue generators. Those are still a ways out, and may not begin to be broached, let alone introduced on the legislative floor until at least 2020.\nThe strategy has its critics, however. Wockner \u2014 executive director of Save the Colorado, a nonprofit that aims to curb irresponsible water projects \u2014 believes taxing citizens to fund water plan projects should not be a statewide objective.\nAs federal dollars through the Bureau of Reclamation have dried up the last few decades, though, most reservoir, dam and stream restoration projects have either been paid for by self-funded water agencies like Denver Water or through loans and collaborative grants. What appears as important as the total cost of the state\u2019s water plan is where funds are first committed, and where further implementation goes moving forward.", "Cornhuskers, if you\u2019re looking for state resources, you\u2019ve come to the right place.

A polar vortex is a cold, thick low pressure system. The air turns counter-clockwise when on the move.\nThe polar vortex started up in Canada. After crossing the border, it moved deep into the southeastern United States. The polar vortex brought the coldest temperatures in more than 20 years to many areas. Anise Jenkins lives in Washington, DC.\nAnother woman, named Amanda, lives nearby in Maryland.\nThe weather was also a shock to visitors from overseas. Deepak from India was visiting his sister in New York.\nThe extreme weather started with a low-pressure system near the North Pole. The Arctic air was pushed as far south as Alabama on wind currents known as the jet stream. The bitter cold covered much of the central United States, forcing schools, government offices and businesses to close.\nCamden Walker is a reporter for the Washington Post. He is part of the newspaper\u2019s Capital Weather Gang, which limits its reporting to the weather.\nBut the polar vortex did not have the same effect everywhere.\nCamden Walker says the weather system moved away quickly from places like Washington. But the cold air and high winds were staying longer in the middle of the country.\nAt least 20 deaths were blamed on the cold weather nationwide. Health experts said people should go outside buildings for only 10 to 20 minutes at a time. They warned that being outside in such cold can cause frostbite. This condition may cause exposed parts of the body to freeze.\nTemperatures of minus 10 degrees Celsius or lower were reported in Washington, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In fact, temperatures in all or parts of the 50 states were below freezing at some point on Tuesday. Even in Hawaii, it was minus six degrees at the top of the state\u2019s highest mountain.\nThe effect of the polar vortex was extensive. Airline companies cancelled more than 11,000 flights over a four day period. The cold weather also interfered with train service. In the south, the Tennessee Valley Authority said it set a single day record for electricity as homeowners struggled to stay warm. The TVA provides power to seven states.\nAnd it was not just North America that experienced extreme cold. Over in the Pacific Ocean, a Russian research ship was stuck in ice for over a week.

When he began the final period on the bench for more than five minutes, the Magic went cold and never completely recovered in a 109-100 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nOladipo tied his career high with 26 points, including three 3-pointers in four attempts. But the Cavs, who have now won five of their past six, got 31 points from Kyrie Irving and 21 from Dion Waiters, all but one of which came after halftime.\nThe game ended with some bad blood between the two teams as Magic forward Andrew Nicholson was ejected with 10.2 seconds to go after a flagrant 2 foul when he shoved Anderson Varejao to the floor. Varejao, who hurt his right knee in a collision with Oladipo during the second quarter, was shaken up but got up under his own power.\nTobias Harris appeared in only his second game of the season for the Magic and his first since Nov. 24. Harris, who suffered a high left ankle sprain during the preseason, converted a three-point play and knocked down a 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter.

Waiters had three baskets and rookie Matthew Dellavedova knocked down two 3-pointers during that three-minute stretch.\nIrving, who was coming off a 37-point showing Tuesday night in a win over New York, almost duplicated that performance. He had 27 points through three quarters and pretty much put the game away with four free throws down the stretch.\nThe Magic finished 11 of 30 from 3-point range. The Cavs entered the game ranked 27th in 3-point defense on the road (.406) but second in the same category at home (.307).\nSunday night at Oklahoma City, 7 p.m. (FOX Sports Florida).", "Is a Local School Board in Philadelphia's Future?\nPhiladelphia Mayor Michael Nutter is recommending that the city's School Reform Commission, the appointed body that has overseen the city's schools for 15 years, be replaced by a board of education that would be selected by city officials.\nIn an education policy speech Tuesday, Nutter said that the time had come for \"the experiment to end,\" according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nThe five-member School Reform Commission, made up of individuals appointed by the mayor and the governor of Pennsylvania, has been on the receiving end of a significant amount of criticism from parents and activists, who often call for abolishing the body during thorny debates, including on how to spend scarce dollars and expanding charter schools.\nIn May, primary election voters approved a non-binding ballot question calling for an end to the School Reform Commission.\n\"Returning to local control means the voters of this city know who to hold accountable for educational outcomes,\" the paper quotes the mayor as saying.\nBut Nutter's recommendation to replace the SRC wouldn't return power directly to the voters, either. His proposal calls for a board of education, made up of nine members. Five would be picked by the mayor; the other four would be chosen from a pool of individuals submitted by the City Council, according to the Associated Press.\nTo achieve Nutter's goals, the commission must vote to dissolve itself, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The state legislature could also amend the law that created the commission, according to the paper.\nNutter's term ends in January, so any return to local control is unlikely to happen on his watch. He says the plan could go into effect by September 2018, following a series of public discussions.\nDistrict officials indicated that while returning to local control was important, adequate funding for the perennially cash-strapped district was more of an immediate priority.\n\"Without addressing that issue, it actually doesn't matter what the governance structure looks like,\" Superintendent William Hite told the Inquirer.\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer also has a good roundup of the how Philadelphia schools did during Nutter's tenure.", "Eric Boehlert's book Lapdogs beats the press.\nEric Boehlert\u2019s book Lapdogs beats the press.\nThe Washington press corps\u2014the thousands of reporters working within a two-mile radius of my M Street NW office\u2014deserves every ugly thing written about it. Taken collectively, they kowtow, fawn, and grovel to the powerful. They allow their sources to compromise their independence. They\u2019re glib. They\u2019re lazy. They possess no sense of history and little sense of scale. They often get the story wrong.\nFirst, a little disclosure: Boehlert has been a friend and respected colleague of mine for 15 years, although I never met him in the flesh until a couple of weeks ago. I admire his reportorial skills, his ability to spot a lie and strafe it, and his devotion to accuracy, which he demonstrates here as well as in his work for Rolling Stone and Salon. He mentions me once by name in the book, non-critically, and alludes similarly to my work or Slate\u2019s elsewhere. End of disclosure.\nAny convincing critique of the mainstream media, or MSM, must take down the two biggest dogs, the New York Times and the Washington Post, which throw more reporters at the political coverage than any other news organizations and provide most of the press corps its marching instructions. On this score, Boehlert doesn\u2019t even try. Critiquing the MSM\u2019s coverage of Bush\u2019s war record, Boehlert knocks the \u201cagenda-setting New York Times\u201d for not pushing hard enough on the story in 2000. Wouldn\u2019t that argue against calling the Times a lap dog? Bush wasn\u2019t the master yet, just a candidate! Additional exoneration for the Times appears elsewhere in the book: Boehlert credits the Times with a \u201clengthy and admirable investigation\u201d into the Swift Boat attack campaign in 2004, when Bush was in the White House.\nIn the book\u2019s preface, Boehlert anticipates the criticisms from people like me who will find examples of tough reporting on the Bush administration to undermine the lap-dog charge. In it he writes, \u201c[J]ust because an article or television report seems on the surface to be asking sharp questions of the administration does not necessarily mean it disproves the basis of my book,\u201d he writes. If such reports can\u2019t disprove his argument, what can?\nDiscussing the Valerie Plame case, Boehlert tries to make hay by noting that \u201cspecial prosecutor [Patrick Fitzgerald] had supplanted the timid D.C. press crops and become the fact finder of record.\u201d Any comparison between the fact-finding abilities of prosecutors, who have subpoena power, and reporters, who don\u2019t, is ridiculous. Also, he\u2019s right that the MSM didn\u2019t aggressively seek to expose the Bush administration source who leaked Plame\u2019s covert identity, but he neglects to acknowledge that very few journalists make a practice of reporting the sources of leaks of classified information to their competitors. The law that may have been broken in the Plame case\u2014Fitzgerald has never said it was\u2014is the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, an ugly piece of legislation. Will Boehlert also denounce the MSM for not finding the sources behind James Risen and Eric Lichtblau\u2019s series on NSA surveillance in the New York Times (Dec. 16, Dec. 21, and Dec. 24)? Felonies may have been committed in the reporting of that story, too, but outside of Commentarymagazine nobody is scorning the press for not assigning I-Teams to out the Times\u2019sources.\nI\u2019ll keep this book on my desk and thumb it whenever I need a solid example of Bush-era press perfidy. But I don\u2019t have additional use for a book that defines MSM hackery as broadly as Lapdogs. For instance, Boehlert disparages former Clinton brain-truster and current ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent George Stephanopoulos\u2014not exactly your standard MSM stooge\u2014for telling C-SPAN in 2003 that the Bush military story had deadened.\nThe University of Maryland Baltimore County has grown dramatically since it opened 34 years ago in a former cow pasture not far from downtown.\nThe University of Maryland, Baltimore County, opened for business in a former cow pasture not far from downtown just 40 years ago.", "ISLAMABAD, Aug 20 (APP):The 47th martyrdom anniversary of Pakistan\u2019s National Hero Rashid Minhas was marked on Monday (August 20) today.\nRashid, who was born on February 17 1951, remains the youngest officer to receive the Nishan-e-Haider award and was the first recipient of the highest honour of gallantry for the Pakistan Air Force (PAF).\nHe got his early education from Karachi and upon reaching the tender age of 17, he joined Pakistan Air Force Academy in Risalpur as a Flying Cadet. In 1971, Rashid graduated from the academy as a general duty pilot and was posted to PAF base Masroor in Karachi\u2019s Mauripur area to hone his skills as a fighter pilot.\nOn August 20, 1971, as a pilot still under training, Rashid was taxing out a T-33 Jet trainer for take-off, when a Bengali pilot instructor, Flight Lieutenant Mataur Rahman, forced his way into the rear cockpit. In mid-air Rahman knocked Minhas out, seized control of the aircraft and headed towards India, PTV news reported.\nWith just 40 miles of Pakistan territory remaining, Rashid regained consciousness and tried to regain control of his aircraft. Failing to do so, he did the only thing within his control to prevent the aircraft from being taken to India \u2014 he forced that plane to crash just 32 miles from the Indian border, deliberately sacrificing his life for the honour of Pakistan.\nRashid was laid to rest on August 21, 1971 with full military honours. The young trainee pilot\u2019s entire family attended the funeral, along with senior PAF and other Armed Forces personnel.\nRashid was posthumously awarded Pakistan\u2019s top military honour the Nishan-i-Haider announced by then president General Yahya Khan.

Meralco Consortium is led by the Manila Electricity Company (Meralco), a 115-year old privately owned entity incorporated in the Philippines.\nThe Concessionaire is expected to invest more than $500 million for new capital expenditure towards reducing generation losses and at the same time expand access.", "Kelsi Dew, from left, Anna Dixon, Amber Wigent and Pearl Wigent are among the 165 people leaving Greenville in three buses this morning to participant in the Women's March in Washington D.C.\nGreenville residents say today\u2019s Women\u2019s March is a jumping off point for continuing efforts to ensure all people are treated with respect and equality.\nOrganizers describe the march, expected to draw tens of thousands to Washington, D.C., as a message to President Donald Trump and Congress that women's rights are human rights. Participants said they also will stand up for other groups they believe were marginalized during the recent presidential campaign.\nAnn Harrington is among 165 people leaving Greenville at 4 a.m. today to participate in the march. Dozens of others from Greenville and eastern North Carolina are carpooling to the event which begins at 10 a.m. with a rally, followed by a march at 1 p.m.\nHarrington is an advocate for allowing woman to join the Catholic priesthood. She was ordained in 2014 in the Association of Roman Catholic Women Priests and is now the priest of the Free Spirit Inclusive Catholic Community.\n\"I want to do this because of the tone that is coming from the president-elect and his people,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople march on Washington as an expression of their citizenship and our belief that we are a democracy and belief in the democratic process, and we have faith in our country to do what is right,\" she said. \"I am going to send that message to the new administration, that we are going to be watching and we're going to be caring a lot about what is going to happen the next several years.\"\nThe Gross family, Michael, an East Carolina University professor; Katie, a special needs teacher; and Jessica, a high school junior, also are taking the bus.\n\"My family and I want to stand with those that are concerned, even anxious about some of the new policies this president has indicated he wants to enact,\" Gross said.\nBefore his election the new president repeatedly exhibited behavior that was disrespectful and dismissive of women, Gross said.\n\"We are hoping he can reassure us,\" Gross said. \"That he will defend the rights of women and minorities and all American people whatever their gender, ethnicity, religious beliefs and, frankly, their income.\"\nAmber Wigent, Kelsi Dew and Katherine Johnson organized the Greenville bus trip.\nIt started when plans by Wigent and several others to stay in a hotel were quashed by a hike in prices, Wigent said. She kept hearing from more people who wanted to go with her group. She eventually contacted a bus company and connected with Dew, who also was trying to organize a trip, through social media.\nPeople who couldn't help but wanted to support the trip paid for college students. When the Washington, D.C., metro system's website went down last week, a number of participants couldn't secure metro passes. Dew said 20 passes were donated to the group.\nAlong with issues such as reproductive rights and access to affordable health care and birth control, marchers will be supporting LGBTQ protections, religious freedom, equality for minorities and other areas of human rights.\n\"It's powerful because you might have 100 people marching for different things, but they are marching together and that's a powerful thing,\" Dew said.\nAnna Dixon, her husband, John, daughter, Ayla, 6, and son Dakota, 5, are taking the bus.\nFourteen members of Dixon's extended family have endured sexual abuse, she said. That includes Dixon, who was 4 when she was assaulted.\nDixon and her family are marching to say sexual violence and abuse won't be tolerated.\n\"I plan to do my best to have (my daughter) grow up in a world that treats her respectfully and have my son grow up to be a man who treats women respectively,\" she said.\nHarrington said while people say the march is a message to Trump and his administration, she sees it as a complement to his goal of \"draining the swamp.\"\n\"I hope my time in Washington, D.C., will help Donald Trump drain the swamp of corruption, lack of civility and meanness that hinders our democratic process by bringing the feminine energies, that both men and women have, of community-building, hospitality, care-giving and reverencing life,\" Harrington said. \"My heart's desire is to help build a more just society.\"\nWigent, Dew and Dixon said they hope people don't confuse today's rally and march with Friday's protests, which resulted in broken windows, a vandalized limousine and Washington police deploying \"crowd-dispersing\" sprays and other crowd control tactics.\n\"It's very important that people understand this is an organized and peaceful event,\" Wigent said. There is a worry there may be people who try to create unrest to distract from the march's message of peace and equality, she said.\n\"In our nervous systems, violence tends to eclipse peace and we need to shift that. We need to pay just as much attention if not more attention on all the peaceful action being taken and the positive action being taken than these acts of violence,\" Dixon said.\nAlong with the national march, state-based and community rallies are being held across the nation. A Women's Solidarity Rally will begin at noon today on the steps of the Pitt County Courthouse.\n\"We want to make sure everybody has an opportunity to be heard,\" said local organizer Amy Bright.\n\"We are as women and marginalized communities under attack right now and we are not going to tolerate these attacks on our rights,\" Bright said.\nThe organization of state and local marches shows the desire people have to put down their screens and connect in person with friends and community, Dixon said.\n\"All these sister marches are part of that desire to connect in person,\" she said.\n\"A lot of people want to do something, they want to be part of something and feel an energy and get out there, but not everyone can for various reasons,\" Wigent said. \"I want to go to the March in Washington and be in the presence of those people, I want to take their energy home with me and make some change locally.\"\nContact Ginger Livingston at glivingston@reflector.com or 252-329-9570.

I hoped to find some of my happiness in my school, but on my first day back the damage shocked and scared me. The classes are overcrowded and the water leaks in when it rains. But I love my school. Having a proper house and school again might help me to forget all the bad days I've lived through since the war.\"\nTwo years since the outbreak of the 2014 war that cost the lives of 1,492 Palestinian civilians, including 551 children, much of the Gaza Strip remains in ruins. Entire neighbourhoods remain cut off from water supplies, destroyed hospitals and clinics have not yet been rebuilt, and tens of thousands remain without a home.\nWhile some reconstruction has progressed, the situation in Gaza remains dire. Less than 10% of the 11,000 homes that were completely destroyed during the 51 day bombardment have been rebuilt. As a result of the war and the impact of the blockade imposed in 2007 by Israel, more than 75,000 Palestinians in Gaza still have no home to return to.\n\u201cTwo years since the beginning of the war, the blockade is severely impeding reconstruction and recovery in Gaza. Unless it is lifted, Palestinians living in Gaza will be unable to move on with their lives and live in freedom, dignity, and safety,\u201d Oxfam Country Director Chris Eijkemans said.\nInternational organizations working in the occupied Palestinian territory are sounding the alarm on the lack of progress in Gaza\u2019s reconstruction as a result of Israel\u2019s heavy restrictions on the entry of materials critical to the recovery process. The organizations called on world leaders to live up to their commitments and press for an immediate end to the blockade.\nThe almost decade long blockade has crippled Gaza\u2019s economy. Without the ability to sell to external markets, private sector employment has plummeted. Overall unemployment is above 40%, with Gaza\u2019s youth unemployment among the highest in the world.\nThe impact of the blockade on children is particularly devastating, and tens of thousands of children remain without a home as a result of the 2014 conflict. \u201cHalf of Gaza\u2019s population are children, many of whom have lived their whole life under blockade. Hundreds of children requiring vital medical treatment are prevented from leaving Gaza. Two years on, the root causes of their suffering have still not been addressed,\u201d said Fikr Shalltoot, Director of Programmes in Gaza for Medical Aid for Palestinians.\nMr Eijkemans said that lifting the blockade is the only solution to give people access to the basic services they desperately need, to allow reconstruction to proceed in full, and to allow Gaza\u2019s crippled economy to restore.", "Facebook\u2019s lawyers are arguing in a court case that the social media platform is a publisher, a designation that runs contrary to its standard line that it is a technology company, not a publisher or media website.\nFacebook used the argument in defending its decision to not publish certain content on its site, which it said is within its free speech rights, according to The Guardian.\n\u201cThe publisher discretion is a free speech right irrespective of what technological means is used. A newspaper has a publisher function whether they are doing it on their website, in a printed copy or through the news alerts,\u201d Sonal Mehta, a lawyer for Facebook, said in court.\nFacebook is defending itself against a lawsuit, filed by a former startup called Six4Three in 2015, that charges it maliciously and fraudulently scooped up user data and data on their friends, even ones that didn\u2019t use Facebook.

This date is no surprise as Madden has traditionally released on the third or fourth Tuesday in August.\nThe game will be available for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.\nI reached out to EA for comment and according to senior publicist Brad Hildebrand, Beckham Jr. is simply campaigning to repeat with the honor. The official announcement won't be made until May 12. If Beckham is still campaigning and the announcement is just days away, you'd have to think he's not going to be the guy.\nIf he were going to be named cover athlete, he would have almost certainly been informed by now. The cover was likely the work of a fan.\nESPN and EA Sports have partnered before to announce the cover athlete, but in previous years the publisher has used a cover vote to determine the face of the newest version of the iconic football game.\nIn previous years, EA had conducted a cover vote, but that was abandoned this year. Carolina Panthers star Cam Newton is my prediction for the honor. He's coming off an MVP season and leading his team to the Super Bowl.\nHe's worked with EA in the past as the voice of The Gauntlet in Madden 15, so he seems like a logical choice.\nIn addition to the cover athlete announcement, the first trailer for the game will also be released.

Telensa has built a solution powered by the Microsoft Azure cloud platform that creates a trust infrastructure for urban data, one that enables cities to collect, protect and use their data for the benefit of all citizens. The first deployment will be in Cambridge in the UK.\nUrban data is the mosaic of street-by-street, minute-by-minute information that makes up a city\u2019s digital twin. It includes mapping how people use the city, the mix of traffic on the roads, the hyper-local air quality and noise levels. This data is incredibly valuable for designing better city infrastructure, delivering more efficient city services, and making everything more transparent to empower citizens. It is also potentially valuable to industries such as retail, real estate and insurance.\nThe use of urban data has been limited by two barriers. The first is the cost of single-purpose sensors, and the related cost of moving video data to the cloud. The second has been one of trust \u2013 how can a city\u2019s Chief Data Officer apply best-practice policies to the data, and provide transparency to citizens on how that data is protected and used.\nData is collected by Telensa Multi-Sensor Pods installed on streetlight poles, with sensors including video and radar feeding into a powerful edge compute platform. The pods run on Microsoft Azure IoT Edge and feature real-time AI and machine learning to extract insights from the raw data.\nData from the pods is combined with other city data in the City Data Guardian. This is the trust platform, built on Microsoft Azure, that enables cities to apply privacy policies, comply with data regulations, and make data available to improve services and drive future city revenues.\nFollowing intensive product development during 2018, the first deployment is scheduled to take place in Cambridge in March.\nTelensa makes wireless smart city applications, helping cities around the world save energy, work smarter and deliver more joined-up services for their citizens. Telensa PLANet is the world\u2019s most deployed smart streetlight solution, with a footprint of 1.7 million lights. Building on the compelling business case for its smart streetlighting, the company provides cities and utilities with an open, low-cost platform to add multiple sensor applications. By leading the Urban Data Project, Telensa is helping cities to build future-proof operations driven by data intelligence, trust and transparency. Telensa is based in Cambridge in the UK, with regional operations in the USA and Australia.", "Published: April 13, 2018 at 01:53 p.m.\nUpdated: April 13, 2018 at 09:16 p.m.\nBreakups aren't easy, especially those that come after an eight-year relationship. Dez Bryant learned that the hard way on Friday.\nFollowing his release from the Dallas Cowboys, Bryant took to Twitter to express his thought process post-schism. Although the 29-year-old receiver admitted the move was a business decision and one that he expected, Bryant still took the release personally.\nIn a series of tweets sent out in the hour following his release, Bryant expressed his love for the Dallas fans (\"I will always love y'all), confirmed that he was not offered a pay cut (\"I need you to know this wasn't my decision\") and hinted that he is open to joining one of Dallas' NFC East rivals. Bryant told NFL Network's Jane Slater that he \"feels free\" following the cut and is \"hyper motivated\" to play for a new team next season.\nIn response to a statement sent out by Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, which explained among other things that Dallas brass \"arrived at this crossroad collectively with input from several voices within the organization,\" Bryant also intimated that he knew the decision to release him was not Jerry's alone.\nWhile Jerry Jones had stayed on the periphery on Bryant's offseason contract quagmire, Cowboys senior vice president Stephen Jones was more vocal. The younger Jones admitted at one point in February that keeping Bryant in Dallas in 2018 on his $12.5 million price tag would be \"a tough one\" and that Bryant understood \"this is a business.\"\nBryant will be re-introduced to the business of football quickly.\nFor the first time in his career, Bryant will be a free agent -- and a highly sought-after one at that. NFL Network's Steve Wyche reported that the market will be \"aggressive\" for the receiver's services despite his release coming so late into free agency. Multiple players, including Tyrann Mathieu, Jamal Adams and Su'a Cravens, began Twitter-recruiting the wideout within minutes of his release.\nWhere Bryant lands remains to be seen. There are many WR-needy teams with salary-cap room to spare, but only three of them (Redskins, Eagles, Giants) play the Cowboys twice a year.\nIf Bryant wants to get back at the Jones and the Cowboys organization for how they handled his departure, landing with one of Dallas' most hated rivals is a good way to start.", "Jordin Canada thinks a lot of her UCLA basketball team.

While scoring is fairly straightforward in volleyball, there are some special considerations when there is a tie during a set or match, or a tie for the rankings in tournament play.\nA match between two indoor teams consists of five sets, or three sets in beach volleyball, according to USA Volleyball rules. Teams serve and volley the ball back and forth, and a team wins a point when they hit a ball into the opponent's court and the opponents either let the ball hit the ground, hit the ball out of bounds on the opponent's side, or cannot hit the ball over the net within three hits. An indoor volleyball team wins the set when they reach 25 points. In beach volleyball, the winning team must reach 21 points.\nWhile the winner of the set is the team that reaches 25 -- or 21 points for beach volleyball -- they must win by a span of two points. In other words, if the score is 24 to 24 and one team wins an additional point, they must win yet another point to make the score 24 to 26, thus being in the lead by two points. The game continues until one team gets ahead by two points. Since the winner must win by a span, there are no ties during a regular set.\nIf the teams each win two sets to make it a 2 to 2 tie, the fifth set is played differently than the preceding sets, though the way the fifth set is played may vary in different tournaments and leagues. In beach volleyball, the third set is played to 15 points when there is a 1 to 1 tie for the first two sets. In USA Volleyball rules, the fifth set is played until one team reaches 15 points, with a two point lead. As with the early sets, if the teams are tied at 14 to14 nearing the end of the set, the team that wins the next point must win yet another point to win the set by a two point margin.\nIt is also necessary to deal with ties between two teams during a seeded tournament. In the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, officials first look at the two teams' regular season records to determine who has won more games. If the teams are still tied, they look next at the \"point differential\" between the two teams, meaning the difference between the winning team's number of points and the losing team's number of points. If that still results in a tie, they look at the number of wins each team had against teams in the current tournament. If that still results in a tie, look at the point differential for each team against the teams in the current tournament. If all of that still results in a tie, officials can flip a coin to decide which is the higher-seeded team. These rules may be slightly different for your league or tournament, so check with your team's governing body for more detailed information.", "Fear that downtown Brooklyn\u2019s apartment market was headed for a bust turned out to be \u2014 a bust. A tidal wave of new units coming to market has yet to make a dent in sky-high occupancy rates or rental costs, according to new data from a business-advocacy group and from the developer of Brooklyn\u2019s tallest tower.\nJust one year ago, the New York Times cited a \u201csinking feeling\u201d among developers due to the impending addition of 28,400 rental units in Brooklyn. Doug Steiner, the developer of the 52-story project called The Hub that was then under construction, worried that it might not have enough amenities compared with competitors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know where the market will be when we finish,\u201d he said in March 2018.\nData just released by the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership show that occupancy is above 95 percent at both old and new rental buildings. Absorption remains strong as most new properties report leasing between 20 and 40 units every month.\nMost new buildings stabilized with a year of being put on the market with lease-up periods ranging from four to 20 months \u2014 in line with developers\u2019 expectations, the partnership said.\nRegina Myer, president of the partnership, which oversees three different business improvement districts, told The Post: \u201cWe want to dispel any notion that there\u2019s a glut. All the talk of oversupply has been overblown. We see only tremendous demand to live downtown.\n\u201cNo owner has complained about a slow lease-up,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, landlord concessions have fallen and in some cases, disappeared.\nMyer noted that it\u2019s important not to conflate downtown with other Brooklyn neighborhoods such as the Williamsburg and Greenpoint waterfronts. Median asking rents in downtown Brooklyn jumped by 15 percent from 2014 and 2018, even while the median rent fell more than 10 percent borough-wide from 2014 to February 2019.\nAn \u201cunprecedented\u201d 14,000 units at 70 locations have been added to downtown since a 2004 rezoning, the partnership said. Among rentals that opened in 2018 were Rose Associates and Beneson Capital Partners\u2019 Hoyt & Horn (368 units); Red Apple Group\u2019s The Eagle (440 units); and AmTrust Realty\u2019s The Amberly (270 units).\nSteiner said that the 750 apartments at the $432 million Hub are 99 percent rented. He said its success reflects a strong leasing market all around. \u201cEverybody\u2019s doing well,\u201d he said.\nDespite old reports that some buildings were offering more than a month\u2019s free rent, Steiner said he\u2019s only given two-week concessions on studios asking from $2,750 to 3,200 a month and one-bedrooms from $3,450 to 4,650.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had about half the concessions of others and leased up twice as fast,\u201d he said. Part of The Hub\u2019s appeal is its location at 333 Schermerhorn St., close to a dozen subway stations, and a 40,000 square-foot amenity space that includes an indoor pool.\n\u201cThe more units that come on the market, the more attractive the area becomes,\u201d he said, as new residents also draw stores and restaurants.\nThey can\u2019t get enough of One Vanderbilt.

After all, the challenges facing Christians in Iraq surely are different from those in Israel and Palestine, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon - not to mention the Christian expatriates in other MENA countries?\nThe Archbishop introduced his Motion to the House, in the presence of some 80 peers, 30 of whom contributed to the lively debate. Amongst the notable contributions were those from Lords Parekh, Patten, Carey, Popat, and Boateng, as well as Baronesses Butler Sloss, Morris of Bolton and Cox.\nMoreover, the Shadow Minister, Lord Wood of Anfield, made a learned and polished summation of the \u201cSituation of Christians in the Middle East\u201d and was followed by Lord Howell of Guildford who responded on behalf of the Government.\nAs a longstanding student of religion and politics in the Middle East and North Africa region, I was quite impressed by the debate. After all, the Motion focused on the situation of the Christians in the MENA region at a time when this vast region is going through many unpredictable convolutions and painful convulsions. In countries such as Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, it feels that those initial popular revolts have morphed into some sort of inchoate revolution, whilst in other places like Syria and Yemen, the bloodletting, violence and uncertainty are acquiring ever-higher and perilous pitches. Of course, one cannot speak with any wholesome authority about this topic whilst ignoring the events impacting other countries from Bahrain and Morocco to Saudi Arabia and Jordan.\nIt is precisely in the midst of all those radical and often unforeseen events that the indigenous Christian communities often feel that they are caught up between a rock and a hard place. The question for them is almost existential at this stage: what is simply better for them? Is it the authoritarianism of decades-long regimes that have allowed them a margin of private space for their religious rites and rituals or is it the uncertain fear of the new realities spreading across this region that are bringing up hefty concepts such as \u2018dignity\u2019, citizenship rights\u2019 and \u2018equality\u2019 let alone more unsettling ones such as \u2018Islamism\u2019 and \u2018shari\u2019ah-led constitutions\u2019?\nFor instance, what would a Syrian Christian feel today in the midst of an increasing likelihood of civil war in the country? Or how does a Copt react to the recent elections that consolidated the position of Islamist movements in the country which will doubtless impact the space of Muslims and Christians alike? How does a Palestinian view those revolts and uprisings - let alone oppressions - in their neighbourhood when their real gripe is with an unending Israeli occupation before it becomes one of encroaching Islamism or internecine squabbles? Would a Lebanese become befuddled when half the Christians support the regimes and the other half the demonstrators, and will Jordanians manage to find the delicate balances that ensure the survival and conviviality of their society?\nThe Archbishop\u2019s introductory statement to the House of Lords was carefully well-calibrated as it made the necessary distinctions between \u2018Islamic\u2019 and \u2018Islamist\u2019 and touched upon the history of the region and its relationship with the West.\nBut I would like to add a few further points that I - as well as ecumenical colleagues I associate with - believe are also crucial elucidations or else questions begging for clearer answers.\n1) It might be helpful to remember always the nature and geography of the Middle East and North Africa region when addressing its problems by underlining that this is not at all a single or monolithic unit but rather a more heterogeneous one whereby both the issues and concerns differ inter partes and therefore remedies would differ too.\n2) There can be no coherent understanding of the marginalisation of Christians (and for that matter of all non-Muslim ethnic communities) without a more profound understanding of the Ottoman Millet system, in terms of ghettoisation and dhimmitude or (simplistically labelled) second-class citizenship, as well as the painful history of Western colonisation of the region that followed the decline of Ottoman rule and the way in which the West manipulated the Christian communities for its own proper interests.\n3) The truism that \u2018not all Arabs are Muslim and not all Muslims are Arab\u2019 is a valid argument within the intellectual bandwidth of the whole region as it introduces into the discussion the Muslim realities in countries such as Malaysia, Turkey and Indonesia (that was not dissimilar in 1998 from what Egypt is undergoing today) and shows an alternative to homebred Salafism.\n4) An appreciation of how history still casts its shadow upon the region and how the Crusades impacted not only the nature of relations and perceptions between the Christians of the West and the Muslims of the East, but also amongst Western and Eastern Christians themselves.\n5) Sectarian violence is more often ethnic rather than religious in nature, but the problem is that ethnicity and religion are intertwined in the Middle East and this overlap continues to be felt in different shapes in many Middle East and North Africa countries today - such as Lebanon to give only one example amongst many.\n6) It is important to consider the developments in the Arabian Gulf and Iran when talking about local Christians and their relationship with Islam or the West. After all, there are established churches in Abu Dhabi, Kuwait or Qatar existing alongside equally conservative sects and schools of Islam.\n7) All countries and their governments which ratified various human rights declarations, conventions or covenants, including the key 1981 UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, are legally obligated to uphold the human rights of all their citizens. But this is simply not being observed and many peoples are facing serious threats to their fundamental rights as rights-based groups, such as those of expression and worship.\na) The Arab Spring is a single phenomenon: it certainly is not so.\nb) This is the moment of the Facebook generation: they have alas been largely co-opted or overtaken by vested interests such as the military and religious institutions.\nc) Islamists are poised to take over the Arab MENA: somewhat an exaggeration that suits some Islamists and Westerners alike as they advance their own exclusivist and quasi-irredentist agendas.\nd) Palestine no longer matters: it is undeniably a central hub for the whole region.\ne) The West can shape the destiny of the Arabs: neo-colonialism is a dangerous strategy.\n9) While some raw or instinctive fears expressed by Christians about their current realities are founded on fact, there exists a degree of dramatisation associated with them that does not always reflect an objective appreciation of the larger grassroots picture. In other words, Christians are living in a wider context of majority Muslim populations, where many Muslims and Christians are suffering repression mutatis mutandis from those wielding political-religious power or exerting them indiscriminately at times. As such, the pluralist nature of a Middle East and North Africa region that is very much predicated upon religion cannot simply be compared to a more secularised West that deliberately attempts to cleave God from Caesar.\n10) We in the West should neither impose solutions nor even forcibly propose them in a political-intellectual form of colonisation. We should not sound too alarmist either, but rather express solidarity that is pro-Christian (as part of our universal fellowship) without being anti-Muslim. We should support the regional struggles for dignity and co-equal citizenship rights, and we should also insist upon the rights of Christians to their fundamental rights, without confusing an Islamist agenda that is exclusive and often inimical of the other from an Islamic one that is a product of the electoral legitimacy of the region today.\nThe Motion tabled by the Archbishop of Canterbury also considered - rather lightly - some ways in which the West could be vigilant about events in the region. Perhaps a House of Lords Committee could well be set up that reports to the House annually on the situation of the Christians of the MENA region. Or else, it might be possible to increase the awareness-raising, advocacy and representation that those Christian communities seek from the West in a way that does not compromise their local ethnic, cultural and linguistic loyalties.\nI include here from Hansard the opening and closing remarks from the Archbishop of Canterbury, alongside those contributions made by the Rt Revd Michael Langrish, Bishop of Exeter, the Rt Revd Christopher Hill, Bishop of Guildford, and the Rt Revd John Hind, Bishop of Chichester.\nThe new story in the Middle East and North Africa region is only one year young and it will take a long time before we can pass any definitive judgments about its successes and failures. This is perhaps one strong reason why we should continue being watchful without necessarily becoming dogmatic, and this is why it makes more sense to win others over to our own opinions rather than antagonising them at a time when too much uncertainty swirls in the whole region. But at the end of the day, our buzz words should consistently remain those dignity and citizenship rights.\nIs my suggestion a recipe for defeatism or conversely for triumphalism? Neither frankly, as it is solely one of pragmatism that is coloured by a Christian prism but nonetheless informed by the politics of a whole region.", "While IT staff at Shazam can provision extra servers at its service provider\u2019s data centers to prepare for traffic spikes during Super Bowl or the Grammy\u2019s, there\u2019s no way for them to foresee a radio station in a big metro playing a forgotten R&B hit everyone suddenly falls in love with and wants to know the name of.\nHandling unexpected demand spikes without overprovisioning hardware is one of the things cloud works especially well for, and Google\u2019s cloud platform has been helping the instant music recognition app survive Shazaming surges smoothly, without paying for way more servers than necessary running around the clock in case half a million millennials in Pittsburgh suddenly want to know who sings \u201cLucille,\u201d all at the same time.\nBut Shazam has been able to use cloud in this particular way only recently. One of the reasons the app recognizes so much music so quickly and so accurately is that it runs on a massive fleet of GPUs, the same type of processors used in supercomputers and servers for machine learning.\nTraditionally, the company has used bare metal GPU servers, which is what two-thirds of its infrastructure still looks like. Cloud GPUs have not been available until recently (cloud giants started rolling them out only last year), and when cloud providers did start offering them, they were way too expensive to be practical for an app like Shazam.\nOn the backend, the application keeps audio signatures for every one of more than 40 million songs in its catalog in custom database format in GPU memory. When you Shazam a song, the algorithm uses GPUs to search the database until it finds a match for the audio snippet you\u2019ve recorded with your phone, finding a successful match more than 20 million times per day, according to Belchak.\nBefore switching a big chunk of its infrastructure to Google\u2019s cloud GPU service, his team would provision enough bare metal GPUs in their data centers for what they estimated peak demand would be and keep the entire fleet running 24/7, 365 days a year.\nBut as they compete for market share, cloud giants have been slashing prices across their services, eventually bringing the cost of their GPU services down enough to be practical for Shazam.\nBelchak did not say whether his company had plans to migrate the rest of its workload to cloud, but you can find more details on how Shazam works in his blog post.", "Chinese labourers work at an Olympics construction site in front of Beijing Olympic National stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, shrouded with smog on October 26, 2007 in Beijing, China.

It could not fly when it was discovered floundering and suffering from heat prostration and brought to the center, which cares for injured and abandoned critters.\nBut Karma learned to fly at the facility and was regularly driven afield for brief falconry-type flights. He always returned to his handlers, but last Thursday in the Keough Hot Springs area west of Highway 395, he dipped behind an outcropping and disappeared.\nCindy Kamler, who runs the facility, told Outposts that people have been scouring a two-square-mile area but have not spotted the bird, which is wearing black leather bracelets on both legs and might be trailing a short orange cord.\nIt's feared that Karma will be unable to fend for himself or find his own food, but Kamler is hopeful and cites a few instances where the bird captured and killed sparrows that had entered its enclosure.\nInterestingly, it had recently begun communicating with wild hawks during its flights, notably a juvenile red-tailed hawk that was present during Karma's last controlled flight. Could Karma simply have answered the call of the wild and sought freedom?\nKamler concedes it's a doubtful scenario, since the bird had been raised in captivity. \"It'd be unique,\" Kamler says, \"but not impossible.\"\nAnyone who spots the hawk is urged to call the center at (760) 872-1487.", "Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s message on World Environment Day, to be observed on 5 June:This year\u2019s observance of World Environment Day shines a much-needed spotlight on the illegal trade in wildlife.\nMuhammad Ali, the silver-tongued boxer and civil rights champion who famously proclaimed himself \u201cThe Greatest\u201d and then spent a lifetime living up to the billing, is dead.

He had proposed legislation to create a limit of 90 pounds a day per person on wild-caught Maine scallops so future generations, he said, would still be able to harvest them.\nMaine scallops are beloved in culinary circles, typically fetching several dollars more per pound than other Atlantic scallops. This past scalloping season, they frequently sold for more than $20 per pound. They are harvested by drag boats or divers, and the fishery has been recovering after a collapse in the mid-2000s; the state&apos;s 2014 catch was the most since 2000.\nAlley said he will try to sell scallop fishermen and the public on the idea again next year.\n\"Some of the young kids that are coming out of high school, they don&apos;t have a job, period, and they don&apos;t have anything to look forward to as far as having a job,\" said Alley, a lobsterman. \"I&apos;m looking out for the kids who want to have a job and stay here.\"\nScallop fishermen repeated concerns from this legislative session that the cap would make it difficult to make money.\nThis past season, which began in December and ended in April, Maine&apos;s southern two scallop fishing zones were subject to a limit of about 135 pounds per day.

The kids were asleep.\nPeople always complain about time spent in cars. They groan about the length of road trips or the unbearable traffic jams. I used to loathe driving, too, but mostly because of the maniacs on the road. However, as a parent who still wants to travel, the maniacs on the road are preferable to my maniacs in the sky.\nOn our two-week road trip through Washington and Oregon, the rental car became a Zen retreat and entertainment center. We consumed family podcasts like \u201cWow in the World\u201d and used apps like Waze and Roadtrippers to avoid traffic or to break up long journeys with interesting stops along the way, respectively.\nDuring multiple six-hour drives, the kids slept for the majority of the time. When they found good reason to scream their heads off \u2014 ie.: Marissa paused in her singing of \u201cI\u2019m Bringing Home a Baby Bumblebee\u201d \u2014 just knowing that we didn\u2019t have to apologize to other passengers allowed Marissa and I to exchange affectionate glances, as if our wedding song had come on the radio. If the tantrums became intolerable we pulled over. Quite often, our breaks were perfectly timed. From Seattle to Walla Walla, for instance, we stopped at the J. Bookwalter Winery for literary-themed cabernets, while our adorable little antagonists resolved their conflicts, outside of hearing range, in a grassy field beside the establishment. In Oregon, instead of Benadryling our kids for the journey ahead like some flying parents do \u2014 you know who you are \u2014 we exhausted them with stops at fruit farms and an alpaca ranch. Then we set off on the long, lovely drive.\nEven \u201cI have to pee\u201d sounded like a melody in our rental car. On airplanes, the children only announce such a thing when meal carts are obstructing the path. But on the road, we pulled over anywhere there was a shoulder.\nWith a car, we could have liberally over-packed; we could have departed whenever it suited us; we could have permitted the children to holler until tomorrow; we could have glimpsed the letters TSA and conjured up some positive image, like Tasty Submarines With Aioli.\nBut it was time to return the rental car and fly home.\n\u201cHow long would it take to drive back to New York?\u201d Marissa asked when we saw the first sign for Portland\u2019s airport.\n\u201cA few days,\u201d I said.\nIt sounded nice, but we flew home to the chaos. To the sonnet.\nAt one point during the flight, I looked across the aisle at my wife. The children smothered her. (I should note, for my reputation\u2019s sake, the kids refuse to sit with me.) The torture in her eyes said it all: No more flying.\n\u201cRoad trip,\u201d I mouthed, before ingesting the torta.\nNoah Lederman is the author of the memoir, \u201cA World Erased.\u201d He writes the travel blog Somewhere or Bust.

Fortunately, he quickly returned to the guitar.\nThey may have put a 40-second time limit on Emmy Awards speeches, but when you\u2019re Al Pacino nobody is counting the seconds \u2014 or for that matter the minutes. As Pacino went well past his allotted time, ignoring the \u201cPlease Wrap it Up\u201d sign that flashed on the TelePrompter, the theatre orchestra didn\u2019t dare play him offstage. Afterward, Pacino, who won the best actor in a miniseries or movie award for playing Dr. Jack Kevorkian, said he almost didn\u2019t make it to the show after his limo driver got lost. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe he thought it was the wrong red carpet,\u201d he said.\nRicky Gervais is no Oprah Winfrey, but at least he tried. After Gervais joked that the more uptight Emmys could benefit from letting the booze flow a bit more freely, like they do at the Golden Globe Awards, a handful of servers showed up with free beer. Unfortunately, there was only enough to go to the first few rows. Anyone else who wanted a beer had to dash to the lobby during a commercial and shell out $10.75.\nOne of the best things about watching the Emmys from inside the Nokia Theatre is not having to sit through commercials. Instead, the audience is treated to clips of particularly funny and charming past Emmy acceptance speeches. One of them this year was the classic clip of Lucille Ball fumbling about without her glasses before being rescued by Milton Berle, who rushed onstage.\nWill the real Amy Poehler please rush back to her seat. The star of \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d got so caught up mingling with staffers from her old show, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast members during a commercial break that she barely made it back to her camera-friendly front-row seat in time to trade with her seat filler.\nAs David Strathairn accepted his Emmy for supporting actor in a movie or miniseries for \u201cTemple Grandin,\u201d Jewel quietly took the stage off-camera with her guitar and had a moment alone in the darkness as she prepared to deliver \u201cHole in My Heart\u201d during her moving tribute to TV industry figures who died this past year. As their pictures flashed on the screen, Gary Coleman, Rue McClanahan and Dennis Hopper got the warmest rounds of applause from the theatre audience.\nAfter Eric Stonestreet won the Emmy for supporting actor in a comedy, his \u201cModern Family\u201d co-stars Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Ty Burrell and Julie Bowen engaged in an old-fashioned group hug. Jane Lynch and Stephen Colbert experienced a different kind of physicality, however, after Colbert presented Lynch with her Emmy for supporting actress in a comedy. The pair had to be chased down and grabbed by a statuesque Emmy wrangler when they exited the stage the wrong way.\nThe upset of the night, as far as the Nokia Theatre audience was concerned, was when the Bravo channel\u2019s \u201cTop Chef\u201d wrestled the best reality show Emmy away from \u201cThe Amazing Race,\u201d which had won it seven years in a row. The most surprised people in the audience? Perhaps the show\u2019s co-host Padma Lakshmi and judge Gail Simmons, who had to race through the audience to meet their colleagues on stage.\nBryan Cranston and his \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d co-star Aaron Paul may have pulled a one-two sweep of the best actor and best supporting actor awards for drama series, but they got stuck with just about the worst seats in the Nokia Theatre. The two were seated at the far right end of the stage, directly in front of the orchestra. The cast members of \u201cGlee\u201d had the best seats, center stage.\nInside the Nokia Theatre lobby minutes before showtime, it was chaos. You couldn\u2019t hear the audio being piped in from the red carpet outside because of the crush of chatty attendees schmoozing. \u201cPlease make your way into the theater!\u201d a security guard finally barked.\nJust outside, the lobby\u2019s men\u2019s room, \u201cThe Amazing Race\u201d host Phil Keoghan was wolfing down a bag of popcorn while Seth Meyers of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d was fidgeting with his smartphone as the show was about to begin. Across the way, Lauren Graham fiddled with her hexagon-shaped purse as she mingled with the crowd. Kevin McHale from \u201cGlee\u201d chatted with \u201cDexter\u201d co-stars James Remar and C.S. Lee.\nInside the theatre, Terry O\u2019Quinn from \u201cLost\u201d and Kate Gosselin from \u201cKate Plus 8\u201d were finding their seats while others stood to watch the last of the red carpet scene as it was broadcast on large television screens. \u201cTurn that prompter towards me. Thank you,\u201d Billy Bush could be heard barking during a commercial break.\nA little more than three hours later, it was time to clean up, as Jimmy Fallon\u2019s attempt to douse the audience with a farewell champagne spritz fell short and mainly just soaked the camera guy positioned below him.", "These lines come from \u201cThe Overstory,\u201d a vast and ambitious novel by Richard Powers published earlier this year. They embody, in concentrated form, the insights of a movement in environmental studies known as \u201cthe new forestry.\u201d It is based on remarkable discoveries about the behavior of trees gleaned over the last few decades \u2014 specifically, that trees behave cooperatively rather than individualistically. They exchange nutrients, protect one another, even communicate through the air.\n\u201cFor every act of competition, there are 90 of collaboration,\u201d Powers said during a recent phone interview. It\u2019s an idea that \u201ccompletely flies in the face of the long-standing Darwinian understanding that it\u2019s everybody for themselves, and that whoever is the strongest wins.\u201d And it inspired Powers, in \u201cThe Overstory,\u201d to create a story in which the interconnection between trees and humans is reimagined in an entirely fresh way.\nBut in keeping with the spirit of this new paradigm, the whole endeavor was conceived in an unusually collaborative way. Powers and three other writers \u2014 environmentalists Bill McKibben and Joan Maloof and novelist Kim Stanley Robinson \u2014 chose four prose texts (two excerpts from \u201cThe Overstory\u201d among them) and three poems. They used these to create a narrative arc that begins with humans\u2019 alienation from nature and ends with a glimpse of its return.\nThe group also decided to select a \u201cmusical intertext,\u201d a stretch of existing music that each composer would use as inspiration, which would provide an underlying unity to the separate contributions. They settled on Mahler\u2019s song cycle \u201cDas Lied von der Erde,\u201d and specifically its final few minutes, where the music reaches a new level of ethereality as the words dwell on eternity and leave-taking.\nThe origins of the piece in nature and forestry should not, Powers thinks, obscure the very human importance that he intends the piece to carry.\n\u201cWe Americans, and we\u2019ve managed to export this around the globe too, have really prized, and rightly so, the power of the individual,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there have been costs to that. And I think anyone who\u2019s paying attention to climate change, to the degradation of natural capital and the environment, to the challenges associated with continuing to exist in a world that could well lose 40 percent of its remaining large animal species by the end of the century \u2014 it doesn\u2019t take a whole lot of paying attention to realize that so much of that crisis . . . fits too easily with a state of mind that\u2019s willing to look out at a forest and see it not as other incredibly complicated and interdependent things that are providing us all the environmental services that we need to live, but as a series of short-term resources that are ours for the taking.", "At least 30,000 Palestinians marched on the Gaza fence. The demonstration marked a year since the start of the Great Return March\u2014a campaign of weekly demonstrations demanding the right of return for Palestinian refugees.\nIsrael attacked the demonstration with lethal force\u2014killing four Palestinians, including 17 year old Adham Amara who was shot in the face.\nHe is the 50th Palestinian child killed by Israeli soldiers since the protests began.\nIsraeli soldiers also wounded some 112 Palestinians according to the Gaza Health ministry\u2014of which 23 were shot with live ammunition.\nThe violence is characteristic of the way Israel has handled the demonstrations since they began.\nMore than 240 Palestinians have been killed since the protests started last year, and over 27,000 injured.

Both staff members received medical and counselling support, and one staff member took a period of sick leave before returning to work,'' a museum spokesman said.\nThe cause was traced back to the practice up until the 1960s of using arsenic to preserve animal exhibits and prevent insect damage.\n''All over the world, natural history specimens have been preserved using materials which you wouldn't use now,'' museum chief executive Dr Patrick Greene told Fairfax Media.\n''In the past, chemicals containing arsenic \u2026 have been very widely used. We wouldn't use it now, but it is the case that in collections such as ours, which go back to 1854, clearly there is always a risk that there will be arsenic involved. Indeed, we know Phar Lap was preserved using arsenic,'' he said.\nFollowing the 2009 incident, the museum undertook a major overhaul of its health and safety protocols for exhibits and now regularly monitors the air quality near exhibits, tests all items on arrival at the museum and has employed a chemist.\nDr Greene said he was confident there were no health risks to staff or the public.\nHundreds of the museum's 17 million objects likely still contain arsenic, including Phar Lap, but as long as they are not touched, they do not present a danger. Dr Greene said that when staff check Phar Lap they wear a mask as a precaution.\n''It is not hazardous while it [Phar Lap] is standing there, but if somebody was to brush it - which we wouldn't do of course - some of the hair with some of the arsenic on it could become detached,'' he said.\nThe 2009 health scare triggered an immediate examination of all exhibits and there have been no complaints from staff or visitors since.\nDr Greene said people with old stuffed animals at home should treat them with a degree of caution. ''The arsenic is not going to fly off, but if the object concerned is losing fur or whatever, well that's when you have got to be very very careful,'' he said.\nThe museum recommends that stuffed animals are placed out of reach and away from eating areas. If they need to be handled, disposable gloves and cloths, and normal hand-washing should be used.\nGary Pegg, owner of South Pacific Taxidermy, in Thomastown, said he was aware of arsenic in older preserved animals and took precautions.\nJason Dowling has been a reporter at The Age for more than a decade.

Also known as Ikrima, he was identified as the lead planner of a plot by the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab militant group targeting Kenya's parliament building and the United Nations office in Nairobi in 2011 and 2012.\nFrank Cilluffo, director of George Washington University's Homeland Security Policy Institute, said the Navy SEALs operation in Somalia underscores the threat posed by the convergence of insurgent groups, particularly al-Shabab and the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).\nWhile Ikrima may not be a household name, he said, \"you have someone who is truly a go-between between al-Shabab, AQAP and probably al-Qaeda central\".\n\"What you're seeing is some of the pooling of these various entities and between various organisations,\" said Cilluffo. \"And you are starting to see convergence of individual actors and of even planning and operations.\"\nCilluffo said the raid suggests that the US is going after top-level member who are targeting foreign and Western interests, rather than those focused on internal Somalia attacks.\nObama approved both operations independently, White House spokesperson Jay Carney said on Monday, saying it was \"a coincidence\" they happened at the same time.\nAs of Monday, the captured Libyan, al-Libi, had not been read his rights to remain silent and speak with an attorney.\nIt is unclear when he will be brought to the US to face charges.\nThe Obama administration has said it can hold high-value detainees on a ship for as long as it needs to. In 2010, a judge ruled the government could prosecute a terror suspect in New York, despite holding him for five years in CIA and military custody because the government has the authority to do this during wartime.\nAl-Libi was indicted in Manhattan federal court in 2000, accused of carrying out \"visual and photographic surveillance\" of the US embassy in Nairobi before it was bombed in 1998. He also participated in possible planning of attacks on British, French and Israeli targets in Nairobi, according to the charges.\nFormer US intelligence officials and military files indicate al-Libi travelled in jihadist circles for decades, using his skills as a savvy computer expert for al-Qaeda. He turned up in remote corners of the world: Peshawar, Khartoum and Kabul, mingling with other Libyan militants.\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in 2001, he fled with other al-Qaeda operatives to Iran. After several years, he managed to leave the country under murky circumstances and make his way to the lawless areas of northwest Pakistan, where al-Qaeda had once flourished. He then went to Libya prior to the fall of Moammar Gadhafi's government and was reunited with his family, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive case.\nAl-Libi, the former officials said, had been involved in battling Gadhafi's forces. All the while the CIA and FBI tracked his movements, waiting for the opportunity to pounce.", "Universities across the region have come under fire after handing out thousands of unconditional offers to students last year.\nThe University of Wolverhampton, Staffordshire University and the University of Birmingham handed out 8,000 unconditional offers between them in 2018 compared to just 358 in 2013.\nThe Office for Students says unconditional offers, which mean students are guaranteed a place at university regardless of exam marks, cause students to miss their predicted A-level marks by two grades or more, while the watchdog has also warned that universities could be breaching consumer law with their indiscriminate use of the offers.\nThe University of Wolverhampton made unconditional offers to 1,315 students last year. That compares to just five in 2013. Unconditional offers made up 20 per cent of the 6,670 places awarded at the university last year, according to UCAS data, compared to 0.08 per cent in 2013.\nOf the 4,795 offers Staffordshire University handed out to students in 2018, 1,920 \u2013 or 40 per cent \u2013 were unconditional. This compares to 20, or 0.04 per cent, in 2013.\nIn 2018, the University of Birmingham made unconditional offers to 4,765 students, granting them a place irrespective of their final grades. They made 330 such offers in 2013.\nNicola Dandridge, the chief executive of education watchdog the Office for Students (OfS), said: \"We are concerned about the rapid rise in unconditional offers, particularly those with strings attached which are akin to pressure selling.\n\"The risk is that this places undue pressure on students to reach a decision which may not be in their best interests.\n\"For a number of universities this data will make for uncomfortable reading. Where they cannot justify the offers, they should reconsider their approach.\"\nSome offers are only unconditional if the student commits to making the university their first choice.\nThese offers are also known as 'conditional unconditional'. The University of Wolverhampton, which has major campuses in Wolverhampton. Telford and Walsall, made 25 such offers last year, just two per cent of its unconditional offers. However Staffordshire made 1,875 offers, a 98 per cent of all its unconditional offers. The county university, which has campuses in Stafford and Shrewsbury, has now vowed to outlaw this practice.\nSue Reece, Staffordshire University's pro vice-chancellor, said: \u201cWe make unconditional offers where we are satisfied that the information provided to us by the applicant, predicted grades and performance at interview, is deserving of such an offer.\n\"We need to consider our diverse student community, many of whom are mature and who may not have come via traditional routes, and will also take into account life and work experience, and an aptitude for personal development, when making such offers.\n\"At Staffordshire University we have considered applicant feedback and will no longer offer \u2018conditional unconditional\u2019 offers as we want our students to be clear that we have properly assessed their offer.\"\nEducation Secretary Damian Hinds called the steep rise in unconditional offers \"alarming\" and has asked the OfS to take action against institutions which could not justify making unconditional offers.\nHe said: \"I have been clear that the steep rise in unconditional offers across a wide range of subjects is disturbing.\n\"But what is particularly alarming in the UCAS data is the huge variation across institutions in their use of unconditional offers.\n\"That's why I am urging universities to use their offers responsibly, and not simply use unconditional offers to get students through the door.\"\nThe OfS said it was \"prepared to intervene\" in cases where unconditional offers are negatively impacting students' wellbeing.\nA spokesman for the University of Birmingham said: \u201cUnconditional offers form a small part of a wider and well developed admissions strategy that has a firm focus on supporting students to make the right choice for them. Our strategy includes a far greater proportion of conditional and contextual offers and is centred on recruiting students who will benefit the most from their time with us whilst minimising the stress associated with securing a University place.\n\u201cWe know that students in receipt of an unconditional offer from the University of Birmingham do not experience the attainment gap seen in other parts of the sector and those students accepting an unconditional offer are among our best performing group once they join us.\n\u201cIn addition to reducing anxiety around exams, we track student retention data so we know that having an unconditional offer has no bearing on the likelihood of a student dropping out of their course.\"\nJames Allen, from the University of Wolverhampton, said: \"Like many universities, the University of Wolverhampton issues a range of conditional and unconditional offers to students.\n\"We pride ourselves on being the University of Opportunity, providing a route into to higher education more often than not to students who may be the first in their families to go to university or to mature learners who are returning to education later in life. Many of our students also come to us through applying directly.\n\"The vast majority of our students come to us through receiving a conditional offer based upon achieving set entry qualifications. We have trialled the use of unconditional offers for applicants with high predicted grades for select courses. We also provide unconditional offers for students who already hold the necessary qualification standards, like mature students.\n\"When we make an offer to any student we take into account a range of factors including prior qualifications, a portfolio, performance and most importantly experience. In some cases it will follows an assessment, an interview or an audition.

Four years ago she signed up when she was struggling in high school.\n\"All the measuring you need to build a boat, the technical know-how - it put everything in perspective. After that, my math and science grades shot up really high,\" said Gonzalez, who will be attending John Jay College in the spring.\nLast Sunday, she was on hand when the young crews on a flotilla of hand-built boats rowed 28 miles around Manhattan, a fund-raising event for Rocking the Boat that pulled in more than $60,000.\nEight boats, each sponsored by individuals and businesses, launched from Pier 40 on W. Houston St., stopped for breakfast at Hallet's Cove in Long Island City, for lunch at Swindler's Cove in Washington Heights and then returned to Pier 40 in the afternoon to celebrate.\nThe event also celebrated the achievements of thousands of youngsters who participate in various programs during the year.\n\"Most of our students are raised in the South Bronx,\" said Adam Green, executive director and founder of Rocking the Boat, now in its 10th year.\nThe youth development program serves more than 2,000 students and community residents. Young people with problems in school or at home find boat building engaging and can learn new skills, especially when the classroom is outside on the banks of the Bronx River.\n\"You don't expect to find boat building here in the South Bronx, where it's so industrialized,\" said Jhairo Colon, 18, a freshman at Lehman College. Three years ago, Colon learned to build a full-size, traditional wooden boat from scratch. \"Learning these skills kept us off the street,\" he said.\nBy the time Colon was 16, he knew how to monitor the Bronx River habitat and became adept in boat restoration. \"It was the first time I ever used a band saw and other power tools - good skills to have.\"\nColon and Gonzalez quickly worked up through five program levels. As \"job skills apprentices,\" they learned to prepare for college and enter the workforce. Now as top level program assistants, they teach boat building and are role models for younger students.\n\"We teach the kids how to build boats and then we take week-long trips out on the Hudson River, rowing from place to place,\" said Gonzalez of her classes. \"You learn some cool rowing techniques and how to row like a speed demon.\"\nGreen has a rule of not hiring former students unless they have gone through all the programs and are in college or working. \"We don't want our programs to be the only thing in their lives,\" said Green.\nAbout 14 former students readied the fleet of large wooden boats for Sunday's river trip. Afterward, they took folks out on river as part of the Community Rowing Program, a regular free event in which residents can row a boat and fish on the Bronx River.\n\"The students were personally affected by this,\" said Green of the fund-raiser. \"It was an experience they never had before.\"\nGonzalez had some complimentary words of her own for Rocking the Boat.\n\"Kids can accomplish something that's outside the box,\" she said. \"Here you have kids building boats. But in all reality, the boats are building the kids.\"", "In the end, the Colorado State Fair governing board said it was hung out to dry.\nIn order to compete at this year's summer expo, the board made it mandatory for livestock participants to register their animals' premise identification, or the property on which it was raised, with the National Animal Identification System.\nPremise ID has become a hot topic of debate in agriculture and politics.\nSupporters say premise ID can help trace an animal's origin in the case of a disease outbreak and is a valuable youth educational tool; opponents say it is a violation of privacy and could be costly to livestock producers.\nThe Fair has been under fire for its policy change since two 4-H participants were disqualified from this year's Junior Livestock Sale for having their animal's premise improperly registered.\nThe youths and their families were reimbursed for travel expenses and for the price their replacement sold for in the sale, which saw a record-breaking profit.\nAlthough there's no mandatory state or federal law to register premise IDs, the board voted in January to make it mandatory at the Fair. They did so at the urging of 4-H and Future Farmers of America groups, Commissioner Steve Holdren said Thursday at a board meeting held at the Fairgrounds.\n\"What's upsetting to me is I feel like we've been thrown under the bus here,\" Holdren said. \"Our friends in 4-H and FFA were the one's jumping on board with this and now they're not so supportive.\"\n\"I think we've been put out front and shot at,\" said Commissioner Loren Whittemore.\nThe two commissioners' comments were made toward the end of the board's meeting, during the agenda's new business session, but the first order of business Thursday morning was listening to public commentary from two animal ID opponents.\nJohn Reid, an Ordway rancher and chairman of the Colorado Coalition Opposing Mandatory 4-H and FFA Premises ID, and Leellen Koroulis of Steamboat Springs both addressed the board.\nThe two read short prepared statements and passed out literature and information on premise ID. They said that enforcing mandatory premise registration would affect the Fair's number of livestock participants in the future.\nKoroulis urged the board to read more about the debate to fully understand it.\n\"The thing is there's more misinformation out there than information,\" said Commissioner Paul Bernklau.\nGeneral Manager Chris Wiseman said: \"I'm disappointed we were put in a bad spot, but from a health and food-safety standpoint, I don't think it's a bad idea.\"\nThe board simply discussed the issues and said it will take action on the policy at its November meeting.\nWhittemore said the mandatory route is the wrong way to go for several reasons.\n\"What bothers me is our legislators, who are our best allies, are against premise ID. They all go to bat for us when we need them, but they're against us on this. I don't think we need to alienate our friends,\" Whittemore said.", "Taj Mahal performing \u201cThe Blues is Alright\u201d Sept. 5 in Lowell, Mass.\nTaj Mahal sheds sunshine on the blues in more ways than one. He can pare the music down to its cotton-pickin\u2019 essence as a field holler. Or he can spin it to span the globe, landing his finger down on a wide variety of indigenous tropical rhythms, from the Caribbean to New Orleans to Hawaii, to various parts of Africa.\nBut the sunniest source of the Taj Mahal blues comes from within the man himself. Now 66 years old and just shy of six-foot, six-inches tall, his cavernous frame commands the stage with a relentlessly infectious, feel-good vibe. I\u2019ve seen him in a wide array of settings \u2014 in a fancy orchestra hall dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and pointed bamboo cooley hat cradling a tiny ukulele, and baking under the sun in a muscle-tee and baggy shorts pouring his vocals through the microphone \u2014 and the dominant constant is that he makes folks want to laugh because they feel so good.\nThat\u2019s not going to happen at the Fitz.

It is expected to be completed by March or April 2020.\nThe original bridge was built in 1964, but was demolished in November 2017 due to the structure deteriorating. Loose concrete was removed to \u201cmaintain the safety\u201d of vehicles using the A90 and the bridge was closed to traffic in May 2017.\nThe council\u2019s transport and environment convener, Cllr Lesley Macinnes, said: \u201cI am delighted that we are able to move forward with this project following contract approval \u2013 this is an extremely complex scheme and I know how much it means to the local community.\nThe total cost of the project is \u00a34,585,227 \u2013 demolition of the former bridge cost \u00a3820,677, while the design set the council back \u00a3323,155 and the construction of the new bridge carries a budget of \u00a33,441,395.\nAs part of the 2018-19 council budget, money was committed by the SNP/Labour coalition for the construction of a new bridge. But in a briefing from council officials earlier this year, it was confirmed that construction work will not start until the spring. The council has \u201canticipated that construction would commence shortly and will take approximately ten to 11 months\u201d.\nAn opposition councillor has blasted the delays to the project.\nLiberal Democract ward Cllr Kevin Lang previously campaigned for the funding to be provided for the replacement bridge. He welcomed the contract being awarded but asked for urgency.\nCllr Lang said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the Burnshot Bridge that needs rebuilding. The council needs to rebuild trust with the people of Kirkliston too. After all, it is now more than two years since the original bridge was closed and yet we are only now at a stage of signing a contract for a replacement.\nConservative ward Cllr Graham Hutchison, who also sits on the finance and resources committee, said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d to support the appointment of a contractor. He added that the progress was \u201clong overdue and welcome news for residents in Kirkliston and the surrounding area\u201d.", "Here\u2019s a riddle: What costs Americans over $12 billion per year, generates more work than the nation\u2019s thirteenth largest employer, drives millions of doctors and patients crazy, and is growing so fast it makes kudzu look stunted? The answer: the over half-billion hours of health care paperwork mandated last year by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Even before ObamaCare the burden of HHS paperwork had been doubling every six years. The sheer complexity of the health care reform law guarantees a massive increase between now and 2020.\nCombined with the red tape generated by insurance companies, state governments, and a proliferation of other organizations, this administrative overhead is a major reason why the cost of health care continues to grow at a rate that dwarfs increases in the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. Our marginal health care dollars are generating less health than ever.\nThese insights come to us courtesy of the Information Collection Budget of the United States, an annual report that documents the amount of time Americans must spend filling out forms at the behest of Washington bureaucrats. By far the biggest paperwork offender is the tax-levying U.S. Treasury, which accounts for 84% of the 8.8 billion hours consumed. But while Treasury paperwork has grown 25% since 1999, the amount mandated by HHS has risen by 331% \u2013 far outstripping the growth rate of any other federal agency. Unchecked, HHS will generate more paperwork than all other non-Treasury federal agencies combined by 2015.\nThe burden of paperwork required by HHS is growing so fast that it now accounts for almost 40% of all non-Treasury paperwork, dwarfing the individual contributions of agencies like the EPA, the SEC, Homeland Security, and the Department of Labor. And it seems willing to demand more information at any price. HHS is now the nation\u2019s foremost offender with respect to the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act, with sixty-five violations in FY 2010. This is nearly 60% of the violations generated by the entire federal government.\nJust how much is 542 million hours of paperwork? Imagine 271,000 people employed doing absolutely nothing other than filling out forms at the behest of HHS. If these people were all in a single private company, it would have more employees than Albertsons. At the current rate of increase, over 540,000 full-time employees would be needed by 2015. That would make HHS paperwork the second largest employer in the country, right behind Walmart. The cost to the private sector for supplying the government with all that information? Nearly $26 billion.\nMost of the people doing this work are doctors, patients, and armies of administrative personnel hired by hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and private offices to help handle the load. All of these documents are in addition to those they have to complete for literally thousands of private health insurers, disability insurers, state governments, licensing boards, and accreditation organizations. If you want to know why your insurance premiums are rising at 9% per year, this is a big part of the answer.\nWhy does HHS need all of this information? Quite simply, federal regulators are now struggling to control nearly every aspect of health care \u2013 from the price and distribution of hundreds of thousands of health care-related goods and services, to the benefits to be included in private health insurance policies, to exactly what procedures doctors must follow when dealing with patients who smoke. It is an impossible task. No central authority can possibly gather and process enough information fast enough to reconcile the needs of hundreds of millions of patients, providers, and medical suppliers. Free markets are efficient precisely because such information is passed along automatically, instantly, and for free in the form of prices, inventories, and demand.\nHHS\u2019s information budget should warn us that the only way to truly reduce health care costs in the long term is by dumping government controls and returning to something that looks far more like a free market in health care goods and services. The entire system needs to be drastically simplified, and fast.\nTo borrow a phrase from the President, we can\u2019t wait.\nDouglas A.

Seeing the Roadrunner outsmart Wile E. Coyote and Bugs Bunny beating Elmer Fudd never gets old.\n\"Samurai Jack\" This time travel, fantasy cartoon recently returned to Adult Swim for a final season after being canceled in 2004. In total, the five seasons of this blunt and darkly comic show about a samurai who gets transported to a future controlled by an evil demon proved it was one of the most unique shows on television, both in style and substance.\n\"Gravity Falls\" This horror story about twins who live with their uncle in the small, mysterious town of Gravity Falls, Oregon only ran two seasons, but there's so much to digest. There are monster fights, colorful characters and a battle against inter-dimensional beings that takes the world into a strange Armageddon. All the while, the twins and their uncle learn to be a family and to look out for one another as the world crumbles around them.\n\"Regular Show\" This cartoon about two slackers who work at a park was as much for stoners and adults as it was for a young audience. Each episode followed a specific formula: slackers Mordecai and Rigby try to get out of doing work, but then a life-changing, potentially world-ending event needs to be stopped. The two protagonists were out of their depth, but they eventually grew up.\n\"Over the Garden Wall\" This is a must-watch on Halloween. The 10-episode series follows the adventures of brothers Wirt and Greg as they try to find their way home. On the way, they meet all kinds of horrifying creatures -- from pumpkin people to a beast who turns lost children into trees. The show takes a lot from American mythology while creating a tense drama that never lets up.\n\"Avatar: The Last Airbender/The Legend of Korra\" This isn't that awful M. Night Shamayalan movie. This is the real deal. \"The Last Airbender\" and its sequel \"Legend of Korra\" are staples in the fantasy genre. They combine a unique world influenced by multiple Asian myths and martial arts styles, along with memorable characters that grow in realistic ways. \"The Last Airbender\" is more about childhood, but \"Legend of Korra\" is about adulthood, tackling issues like trauma and war in a sensitive manner.\n\"Hey Arnold!\" The Nickelodeon cartoon created by Craig Bartlett followed a group of fourth graders living in the big city, complete with a diverse cast and realistic situations. It ran the gamut of characters, touched upon issues like race, economic status and, over the seasons, told stories about the breadth of human experience.\n\"Gargoyles\" The concept was hokey -- gargoyles come to life at night and fight crime. But in two seasons (the third one doesn't count), \"Gargoyles\" managed to blend comedy and drama for a rich fantasy series. The creators really experimented with storytelling, utilizing concepts such as time travel, magic, romance and Keith David for a vital 1990s flashback.\n\"My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic\" It's become a joke in the public consciousness at this point, thanks in part to its adult male fans, but \"My Little Pony,\" in many ways, warrants its giant audience. It's about young ponies and their adventures growing up and learning about friendship, but it also features intricate jokes and references that keep you hooked.\n\"Justice League/Justice League Unlimited\" For many, \"Justice League\" and its continuation \"Justice League Unlimited\" were the things that introduced us to the bulk of the DC lineup. It was created by Bruce Timm, who helmed \"Batman: The Animated Series,\" so it had a lot in common tonally with the previous entry on this list, but what made it stand out was how it incorporated storylines and characters from the DC canon so seamlessly and without sacrificing much for its young audience.\n\"Spectacular Spider-Man\" It only ran for two seasons, but arguably the best Spider-Man cartoon left its mark. The show took the webslinger back to high school, where he had to juggle being a superhero while also being a good friend and student. More than any of the movies or other shows, \"Spectacular Spider-Man\" understood the essence of the character and focused on his inner turmoil. Plus, the villain storylines -- and the cliffhangers -- are expertly done.", "Girl Guides and Girl Scouts in 146 countries will enlist boys as part of a United Nations campaign against gender violence.\nThe UN's 16 days of activism start on Friday and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) wants its 10 million members to take part, campaigning in their own schools and colleges.\nMany girls \"face violence and harassment on a daily basis\", according to Nicola Grinstead, chairwoman of the association.\n\"The severity of the issue is significant.\nFor girls at school, \"the fear of violence will stop many of them from reaching their full potential\", said Ms Grinstead.\nand in Sri Lanka the guides are working with local government and in schools to get the message across.\nThe UN campaign will last from November 25 International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women until December 10 UN Human Rights Day.\nAccording to the UN, women across the world are subject to physical, sexual, psychological and economic violence, regardless of their income, age or education.\nless than 40% of these sought help - and only 10% went to the police.\nAhead of the campaign, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said: \"Violence against women and girls is a human rights violation, public health pandemic and serious obstacle to sustainable development.

But how do you decide which is the best retirement plan for your business? Here's a summary of three popular plans, along with advantages and considerations of each one.\nAn SEP IRA is a business retirement plan available to business owners and their employees. SEPs are especially attractive to self-employed individuals without employees. Contribution limits on these plans are remarkably high. For the 2013 tax-filing year, the SEP IRA allows contributions up to 25% of compensation or $51,000, whichever is less. The same percentage of compensation must be made for every employee, and contributions to SEP IRAs are always 100% vested, or owned, by the employee.\nYou as the employer decide if contributions will be made year to year. That gives you the flexibility to maximize contributions during years when the business is generating significant cash flow and suspend contributions in lean years. Regardless of how much you contribute as the employer, eligible employees can make traditional IRA contributions to their SEP IRAs, allowing them to exclude income from their own individual taxes.\nSEPs are very inexpensive and don't require special IRS filing like others do, which makes them even more desirable for business owners. Even better, the SEP IRA is the only plan that an employer can still establish and fund for the 2013 tax-filing year, making it the best retirement plan for small-business owners who want to contribute for 2013.\nThe SIMPLE IRA is a low-cost, easy-to-administer plan for businesses with up to 100 employees or for self-employed individuals. A key benefit of the SIMPLE IRA is that it's a salary deferral plan with both employee and employer contributions. Employees can decide how much to contribute, and you as the employer must also make contributions.\nFor the 2014 tax-filing year, the SIMPLE IRA allows salary deferral contributions up to $12,000, or $14,500 if age 50 or older. As the employer, you must make either a dollar-for-dollar match of salary deferrals up to 3% of a participant's compensation or a non-elective contribution equal to 2% of each eligible employee's compensation.\nFor sole proprietors who want to make the highest contribution possible for themselves (and, if applicable, a working spouse), the solo 401(k) is a great, low-cost option. The biggest benefit of this type of plan is that it allows for the highest contribution. As the employer, you decide whether to make pre-tax (and, if permitted, Roth after-tax) salary deferral contributions and the discretionary contribution percentages.\nFor the 2014 tax-filing year, the solo 401(k) allows salary deferral contributions of 100% of compensation, up to $17,500 or $23,00 if age 50 or older. As the employer, contributions can be made up to 25% of compensation. Salary deferrals plus employer contributions may not exceed $52,000 for tax year 2014, excluding catch-up contributions.\nConsider establishing a retirement plan for your business today. By doing so, you'll not only save money for your retirement, but also keep more of your business income shielded from Uncle Sam. You can find more information about the best retirement plans for small-business owners directly from the IRS. Then be sure to check out brokerage firms that can help you establish the best plan to meet your needs.", "Email provider VFEmail has been hit by a huge attack that resulted in all of the data it stores in the US being wiped out.\nDescribing the attack as \"catastrophic\", VFEmail revealed that a hacker had breached its security and succeeded in deleted not only primary data systems, but also the backups. The attacker was caught in the act, and it was possible to intervene before damage was caused to servers in other countries. But for VFEmail users whose data was stored in the US, the news is far from good.\nThe attack took place on Monday, and a message on the VFEmail website explains: \" We have suffered catastrophic destruction at the hands of a hacker, last seen as aktv@94.155.49.9 This person has destroyed all data in the US, both primary and backup systems. We are working to recover what data we can\".\nAt this time I am unsure of the status of existing mail for US users. If you have your own email client, DO NOT TRY TO MAKE IT WORK.\nIf you reconnect your client to your new mailbox, all your local mail will be lost.\nAt this time, the attacker has formatted all the disks on every server. Every VM is lost. Every file server is lost, every backup server is lost. NL was 100% hosted with a vastly smaller dataset. NL backups by the provider were intact, and service should be up there.\nThis is all I can do at this time. I will need to get into the datacenter to see if the one file server I caught during formatting can be recovered. If it can, we can restore mail, but most of the infrastructure is lost.\nVFEmail is slowly trying to get things back up and running, but it is a slow process assessing just what happened.

When I leave the office I dont power down, I just put my machine to sleep so that when I get home I can carry on working. With win 7 there was no issue with this, now with windows 10, when I try \"Wake up\" my laptop goes into a boot cycle as if I requested it to restart. The reboot takes about 15 -30 min every time. I have tried to find a solution for the issue but cant find anything.\nI recently discovered that windows 10 has issues with AMD Radeon graphic cards but my drivers are up to date so im note sure what the issue can be.

With a young population that is usually labelled as \u2018unfit for employment\u2019 despite a proliferation of institutes and schools, the spotlight has often been turned on the quality of education provided here.\nAnd The Karnataka Education (Amendment) Bill, 2017, which proposes stringent punishment for those involved in exam malpractices, has reignited the debate. If a student is caught copying in an exam, then he/she can be barred from writing an exam for up to three years.\nFramed to make the examination and evaluation process foolproof after the II PU question paper leakage last year, the bill has drawn mixed responses. Mostly everyone says that a comprehensive look at the root cause of such malpractices is what is required.\n\u201cIf students are copying, then it is a reflection on not just the teachers but also the society,\u201d says Roshan Sylvester, a lecturer.\n\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t respect the system that much or maybe they have some other grievance. There is no method to redress these in a sector that is increasingly looking at students as products. They are educated to make a living and not to live,\u201d he adds.\nSriram Sullia agrees. As part of a group that knows the pulse of the youth, Sriram feels that the problem lies somewhere else. \u201cWe should ask why they are copying the first place. The excess importance on marks and examinations has created a feeling that students just have to score well to do well in life. They have no idea why they are studying some things,\u201d says the RJ.\n\u201cEven if the quantum of punishment is increased from three to five years, there will still be students who will resort to copying \u2014 that\u2019s how desperate they are at that time,\u201d he adds.\npaper leaks and refusal to report for evaluation of answer scripts.\n\u201cCriticising teachers has become somewhat of a trend these days. Some effort should be made to understand their problems and why they refuse to go for evaluation, if they do so,\u201d says Roshan.\nHis words ring true in the light of the fact that despite the new law, about 4000 PUC lecturers didn\u2019t turn up for work on the first day of answer script evaluation.\n\u201cThe whole process seems kind of archaic to me. We need a more continuous kind of assessment; the evaluation process we have right now is neither cognitive nor meaningful,\u201d he adds.\nSurya Manoharan, a college student, feels that the new decision has both pros and cons.\n\u201cThe advantage is that the entire system will become more fair. Students who work hard will not lose out to someone who gets more marks through unfair means.", "Long Branch, NJ - The Long Branch Concordance and the City of Long Branch will host the 7th Avenue Community Garden again this year. The kick-off will begin with a breakfast at the Community Garden scheduled for Saturday, April 14th at 9 o'clock a.m. The LBC hosted 27 families last season. Each then cultivated their own garden plots and contributed time and energy to the communal garden as well. The program is co-facilitated by Lisa Bagwell, master gardener. This is Lisa's fourth season working the community gardens for Long Branch. \"I am very pleased that the LBC is involved with the Long Branch community gardens. It is in the best interest of the local residents that there be coalitions of people in the not for profit sector working to create and build a better community through projects such as the building of community gardens. The LBC has made great strides in involving the local community in the past year and I look forward to the most productive season yet for 2012.\"\nThe Community Garden offers the LBC many opportunities to reach out to the community providing programs such as Community Parent Advisory Board, crochet workshops, nutrition and cooking classes, parent education classes, and parent-child activities. All workshops and educational components, including the garden itself, focus on growing the family's economic self sufficiency and sustainability. LBC programs also focus on enhancing parent's life skills, literacy, and knowledge base.\nAs the Garden has grown each year, so has the community's involvement in it. \"It's been amazing and really quite wonderful to see how many people come each week to tend their plants, to share recipes, and to learn about nutrition,\" said Lisa Wilson, MSW, LBC's Executive Director.\nShe added, \"Now that it has become part of the fabric of the area, and since virtually all our participants are Latino, we are reaching out to Monmouth County's business community to become corporate sponsors. Besides helping offset LBC's expenses for the garden, community sponsorship will raise awareness among this important population of businesses that care about them.\"", "KUALA LUMPUR: Newly elected MCA Youth chief Chong Sin Woon said he would work closely with the new office-bearers although several names from his cai dan (menu) did not make it to the line-up.\n\u201cI would like to thank the delegates for having faith in me to steer the wing. I respect the delegates\u2019 decision as they did not vote in accordance to the menu. \u201cIt shows that the delegates have already assessed the calibre of candidates before casting their votes.\n\u201cI can accept the chosen leaders. We will form a strong line-up and inject a new breath of air into the party as listed in my manifesto,\u201d he said after winning the post yesterday.\nHe polled 794 votes while Datuk Goh Gaik Meng secured 701 votes. Cai dan is a Mandarin word which means menu or \u201clist of orders\u201d; in this case, it is a list of candidates aligned to certain leaders.\nChong, 39, said he would focus on the party\u2019s political struggle and issues, besides education and economic matters.\n\u201cWe will provide training to the delegates so that they could provide quality debate and present strong political analysis during assemblies.\n\u201cBesides this, we need to map a clear direction for the Youth wing. We can only attract young people and win the heart of various races once we consolidate and regroup.\n\u201cOur ultimate struggle is to create a fair and just society,\u201d he said.\nHe said he was glad that the election was free of mudslinging and wild allegations.\nNewly-elected deputy Youth chief Chris Lee Ching Yong pledged to give 100% to the new team to help unite and strengthen the wing.\nAsked how he would work towards unity as he and Chong were seen to be from different teams, Lee said the election was a very healthy process of democracy.\n\u201cIt is normal to have two different teams contesting but it does not mean that we have a different direction. It will not be a problem,\u201d said the Bakri deputy division chief.\nLee, 37, won the number two post with a 194 majority after garnering 844 votes against Ting Tai Fook.", "Asked outside why she was there, Davis-Raiford said she was \u201ccurious.\u201d Asked if she had a financial interest in the foundation\u2019s new for-profit company, CPM Community First, Davis-Raiford said she was on her way to another meeting. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to do an interview,\u201d she said.\nThe new lease, part of a complex transaction involving the for-profit Meek spin-off and a company tied to an Orlando commercial real estate firm, is set to face a committee vote Thursday.\nFrom there, it would head to the full 13-member commission for final approval. A decision on the $5 million grant, which already has received preliminary commission approval and an endorsement from Mayor Carlos Gimenez, would come later \u2014 and after the mayor\u2019s administration finishes its negotiations with the foundation.\nAs we have never presented our proposal to the new director and are very excited about the project, it is hoped that we can discuss this very soon.\nTo qualify for the money, the foundation and its partner would need to build the project and employ 1,000 people at county-approved wages.\nDavis-Raiford is a Gimenez appointee, and is part of perhaps the most powerful family in Miami-Dade\u2019s African-American political establishment. Carrie Meek, a Democrat, served in Congress between 1993 and 2003, and was succeeded by her son, Kendrick. He served until 2011, after losing a race for the U.S. Senate. Davis-Raiford, a veteran of local government, started at Miami-Dade in 2003 after holding senior posts in New York City government.\nShortly after taking office in 2011, Gimenez promoted her from the director of the county\u2019s fair-employment division to take on the sprawling Community Action and Human Services Department. The department employs 520 people and includes the county\u2019s elderly programs, Head Start and disability services.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s Ethics Commission has already conditionally cleared her work for the Meek Foundation, a nonprofit formed in 2001 that until recently reported no staff or office space and little money. In 2009, the commission said she could serve on her mother\u2019s foundation as it pursued the Opa-locka deal, provided that she not appear before any county board on behalf of the nonprofit or \u201cmeet with County officials\u201d over county funding.\nEmails from 2014 provided in response to a public-records request show Davis-Raiford copied on a string of discussions about an appraisal dispute that would help determine ground rent for the parcels. On July 22, 2014, Davis-Raiford wrote an airport official from her Bell South email account to set up a meeting with Miami-Dade Aviation Department director Emilio Gonzalez, who started in his post about a year earlier.\nThe case file shows Davis-Raiford, a law school graduate, said the 2009 opinion freed her to engage county officials on non-funding matters for the foundation. The case report said \u201cher interpretation would have proven problematic\u201d if she ended up lobbying county officials on non-financial matters, like permitting at the airport.\nThe foundation\u2019s pursuit of county money began in 2014, when the Meek Foundation and others applied for part of a $75 million pool of economic-development dollars that Gimenez and commissioners wanted to distribute.\nIdle for 10 years, the economic-development fund was not advertised before the administration began the approval process for assigning the money in 2014. A string of politically connected applicants won early approval for the grants, including campaign donors like Skyrise developer Jeff Berkowitz and affordable-housing developer Landmark. Two for-profit aviation operations at the Opa-locka airport separately backed by Jeff Soffer and Leonard Abess \u2014 two of the most prominent business executives in Miami-Dade \u2014 also won initial backing for grant money.\nTwo years later, aside from a $6 million renovation of Miami\u2019s Flagler Street, none of the economic-development grants has won final approval from commissioners as administration officials continue negotiations with would-be recipients.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s meeting, the Meek Foundation was represented by various lawyers and real estate executives and Tony Crapp Sr., a former Miami-Dade administrator who said he joined as the nonprofit\u2019s executive director last month. His hire marked a significant change for the foundation, which tax records show had no payroll expense in 2014 and only $11,000 in revenue.\nThe nonprofit has been paying Miami-Dade $30,000 a year to maintain its lease at Opa-locka, started in 2008 and was supposed to produce a $110 million Carrie Meek Industrial Park. The nonprofit blamed the real estate crash for delays, and in 2010 commissioners agreed to extend the mandatory start of construction from 2012 to 2015.\nEven with the extension, the Meek Foundation wasn\u2019t able to start construction on time. The amended lease heading for a Thursday vote by the Trade and Tourism committee would create a new eight-year development timetable, and ultimately give the Meek entity a 64-year lease on the land.\nCounty documents outline the complex transactions involved in transferring the lease from the nonprofit foundation to for-profit entities. It described the for-profit CPM Community First as a \u201cwholly owned subsidiary\u201d of the foundation. State corporate records show the company was formed March 28, with Carrie Meek as its president, and her son and Davis-Raiford holding two of the other three board seats.\nCPM is set to own 30 percent of the for-profit entity that would take control of the Opa-locka lease. CCRE Meek LLC would be controlled by Foundry Commercial, an Orlando-based firm until recently known as CNL Commercial Real Estate. Ford Gibson, a veteran of Miami-Dade\u2019s commercial real estate industry, is joining Foundry to lead development at the Opa-locka site.", "Passionate and persistent, Clyve invites students to think on their feet.\nScott Clyve, one of this year\u2019s Rev. J. Donald Monan Professors in Theatre Arts at Boston College, has over 30 years of experience in the field of production design. He\u2019s worked for Pope Francis, former President Barack Obama, Nicki Minaj, Coldplay, Jason Aldean, Lil Wayne, and Kanye West. He\u2019s worked on Broadway and Off-Broadway shows, The Nutcracker, The Urban Nutcracker, operas, and tours both regionally and nationally, and he most notably was asked to consult on lighting the popemobile, the only car that has ever actually mattered.\nClyve got the bug for production design when he was 15 years old, and shadowed a lighting designer at a play his mother was producing in Bangor, Maine. The designer got in a fight with the director, and it didn\u2019t end well, as those things tend to not end well. Since the designer was the only designer in Bangor\u2013 not a city known for having plenty of lighting designers\u2014Clyve stepped into the void.\nClyve specializes in lighting design, but has extensive experience with set design, production management, and production design as well. He credits his diverse skill set as the reason he\u2019s still so passionate about everything he does.\nNo two jobs for the show business veteran are the same. Clyve does admit that there was one moment where that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\u201cThere was a time, I do remember, about five years ago, I was in a \u2018Okay, I feel like I\u2019ve hit a plateau, what\u2019s next,\u2019 \u2026 And then the Pope came along. It was actually Nicki Minaj came first, and then the Pope came directly after that. It took me down a different road,\u201d Clyve said.\nHe explained that the different jobs he has each provide a different sense of satisfaction. When he\u2019s in charge of lighting, the audience is wowed over the course of the show, realizing the impact Clyve has had by the time the curtain falls. When he\u2019s the set designer, he can get that reaction when the audience walks through the doors, but he doesn\u2019t find it quite as impactful. When it comes to production design, that\u2019s all behind the scenes work that serves as a means to an end. Clyve does it, and he is good at it, but the audience reaction is what he works for, which he can only get from his other two capacities.\nClyde\u2019s life philosophy came from his two children, who have made him realize the importance of relationships and value every person he encounters. Clyde looks at the world\u2019s population as a pastiche of stories.\nClyve tries to take a lesson or memory away from every conversation. If he never stops learning, he can never fall behind\u2014he learns from stories.\nWhile he was in college, a professor told him that back in the day, people who tried to get into the design union had to go through a test where they had to hang lights with members of the union.\nFrom then on, they gave him all the respect in the world.\nEight years ago, BC brought Clyve in to light Metamorphosis, and the relationships the designer forged kept him coming back. A few years ago, he taught his first class, subbing in for a professor\u2019s computer aided drafting class, and it gave him a teaching bug he hasn\u2019t been able to get rid of since. Clyve has spoken and taught master classes at multiple universities and sat in on meetings to help productions out with his extensive backlog of experience providing the background for all of his advice.\nHe became one of the Rev. Monan professors\u2014visiting positions donated in honor of Monan, a former University president and chancellor, beginning in 2007\u2014at the start of this academic year. This semester, he is teaching a couple of classes: the computer aided drafting and design class that originally got him into the classroom and an entirely unique course called Event Design and Organization.\nClyve explained that he\u2019s never heard of or seen another class like it. It isn\u2019t taught out of a textbook, and it shouldn\u2019t be\u2014no native space is the same, no problem that needs to be solved identical within a space. It\u2019s the perfect experience-based look at how to improvise in order to improve or fix an event. He believes improvisation is a big deal\u2014thinking on your feet can\u2019t be taught out of a book.\nHe went on to disclose that when people are hiring in show business, what makes candidates stand out is how well their shows have done. Being a part of a show that tanked, even if it isn\u2019t necessarily a candidate\u2019s fault, can really follow members of the show business community around. Learning the skills Clyve has honed over his career helps students and professionals alike avoid those pitfalls.\nHis teaching philosophy is unique as well. Due to his schedule, the classes he teaches are once a week\u2014one is two hours, the other two and a half. That can lead even the most passionate of students to some moments of boredom. Clyve identifies this as one of his tougher challenges to deal with as a professor.\n\u201cAs you can tell, I love to tell stories, so if I get to a certain point and I\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m starting to lose people,\u2019 I\u2019ll tell a good story\u2014maybe it\u2019s related maybe it\u2019s not\u2014but it gets the juices flowing again and then back onto the lesson,\u201d he said.\nBeing passionate about something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s awesome 100 percent of the time. Clyve\u2019s mission is to encourage that passion, not dampen it because there\u2019s a lot of information he needs to teach his students. He even has a backup plan for if he misses class. Typically, students would probably prefer to see class canceled, but in a two-hour class, time in the classroom is especially vital to getting the most out of the course. Clyve always has a backup plan: If he has to go to an event, he has a Skype system set up and ready to go\u2014that way when class-time rolls around, he can Skype in and show his class the intricacies of an event set up. It\u2019s as close to on-the-job training as a student can get in a classroom.\nWhat\u2019s Clyve\u2019s favorite part of teaching at BC? When he was asked, he leaned into the microphone carefully and said, loudly and clearly, \u201cTHE STUDENTS.\u201d Despite his ironic-delivery, he means it.\nHe loves seeing the passion in his students, and loves watching them be astounded by the learning process. Clyde gets to watch minds grow.\nClyve isn\u2019t short on general advice either. When he was first starting out in New York, he had essentially zero connections to the business, and any paycheck he was cashing couldn\u2019t possibly cover the rent for his apartment. So for a year, he asked every director he worked for to tell 10 people about Clyve\u2019s work in addition to the $300 check the designer would get for the week.\nBy the end of the year, his name was associated with great work, and his career began to take off.\nIn show business, selling yourself is being yourself, according to Clyve.\nWhen he was asked which of his incredible experiences stood out the most to him, he starts with the reaffirmation that working for the Pope, and on his popemobile, stands out above the rest. But he also notes that his experience with Obama is something he\u2019ll always remember.", "If you\u2019re planning to commit an act of terror in the US and want to be left alone by the FBI, make sure your target is something, or someone, that the US government doesn\u2019t like or care about.\nConsider these two terrorist plots.\nJust last week, on Jan. 14, the FBI announced that it had arrested Christopher Lee Cornell, a guy in Ohio the bureau alleges had plans to attack Congress with pipe bombs and guns. Apparently acting alone, Cornell is alleged by the FBI to have \u201cresearched how to make pipe bombs\u201d (there\u2019s no indication that he actually made or tested any actual bombs), and to have purchased a pair of M-15 semi-automatic rifles and ammunition. How Cornell, who is described as a self-styled \u201cjihadist,\u201d but one with no real connection with foreign Islamic militants, planned to get past the metal detectors and tight security at the Capitol Building in Washington, was not explained, and probably was not known to Cornell himself. It also appears that the FBI was watching Cornell all along, and no doubt encouraging him too, as it was working with a snitch \u2014 a man facing prosecution who was in communication with Cornell and may well have been a provocateur, given the Bureau\u2019s prior history of luring vulnerable people into planning terror acts which it then busts.\nThat\u2019s a lot of rich detail about an evidently serious plot that never resulted in any arrests.\nActually, the response of the US Homeland Security Department to journalists who looked into the federal government\u2019s involvement in the violent suppression of the 2011 Occupy movement don\u2019t shouldn\u2019t make anyone feel like \u201cresting assured\u201d about anything. In 2014, we learned that our publication, in fact, had been the subject back on Nov. 18, 2011, of an alert sent out by Homeland Security\u2019s Washington Office of Threat Assessment to all Fusion Centers around the country, saying ThisCantBeHappening! had published an article exposing the Homeland Security\u2019s central role in orchestrating the wave of local police violence against Occupy encampments across the country.\nThe conclusion, hard to avoid, is that the FBI and Justice Department are playing a double game when it comes to terrorism. On one hand they have been aggressively pursuing a campaign of entrapment and outright incitement, actively promoting and assisting in the development of bogus terror plots by naive or mentally unbalanced individuals, so that they can later \u201cbust\u201d those plots, thereby justifying their expansive police-state tactics while keeping the public in a constant state of fear. On the other hand, they are either turning a blind eye towards genuine plots aimed against activists and radical protests, such as the one \u201cidentified\u201d in Houston in the fall of 2011, or worse, are maybe actively involved in the development of those plots, which they then do not prosecute or prevent from happening.\nThis is something we need to keep in mind as we watch the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the only surviving suspect or witness in the Boston Marathon bombing \u2014 an actual terrorism act that has many rational people wondering how much the government knew in advance, and others wondering or were just patsies who were set up to look that way.", "Symantec has signed a deal to acquire VeriSign's authentication and identity business, including its renowned SSL Certificate Service, for $1.28 billion in cash.\nAltogether, the Symantec-VeriSign deal will give the security giant VeriSign's SSL Certificate Services, Public Key Infrastructure, VeriSign Trust Services and VeriSign Identity Protection Authentication Service. Under the terms of the agreement, Symantec will acquire specific VeriSign assets, including the majority stake in VeriSign Japan, for $1.28 billion in cash, but could be subject to customary closing conditions such as regulatory approvals. The deal is expected to close some time during the September quarter.\nVeriSign executives said that the deal \"marked a milestone in the company's history,\" while hinting at the ongoing trend of market consolidation that made it challenging for standalone products to experience market growth.\n\"The security industry is consolidating, and customers benefit when authentication services are part of a broader offering, which means our SSL, PKI and VIP products would best be integrated with other security services and applications. Symantec has a broad suite of market-leading security offerings and a robust distribution network that is a natural fit for our authentication products,\" said Jim Bidzos, VeriSign executive chairman, during a conference call. \"In light of these considerations, we believe the sale of the authentication business to Symantec is the right thing for our employees, our customers and our shareholders.\"\nThe acquisition aligns with Symantec's stated vision to further delve ito areas such as identity security, mobile security, information protection, context and relevance, and cloud security.\nSymantec executives contend that the deal will enable users to have simple and secure access to their information from anywhere, with a way to provide businesses the means of incorporating identity and authentication security into a the fabric of IT infrastructure. Technology from the acquisition will also allow organizations to feel safer when adopting new computing models, applications and resources, including cloud computing, social networking and mobile computing, executives said.\n&#8220;With the anonymity of the Internet and the evolving threat landscape, people and organizations are struggling to maintain confidence in the security of their interactions, information and identities online. At the same time, people&#8217;s personal and professional lives have converged and they want to use their various digital devices to access information wherever they are without jeopardizing their privacy,&#8221; said Symantec CEO Enrique Salem in a statement. &#8220;We believe the solution to this dilemma lies in the ubiquity of identity-based security.\"\nDown the road, VeriSign's SSL Certificate Services and other authentication technologies will be combined with Symantec's existing security products, such as Symantec Critical System Protection or Protection Suite for Servers, in an effort to further secure customer's Web servers, and provide added trust during financial and other sensitive transactions, executives said.\nIn addition, Symantec has tentative plans to combine the information classification capabilities in its Data Loss Prevention solutions and Data Insight products along with VeriSign&#8217;s identity security services, which will help ensure that only authorized users have access to specific information.\nSymantec also has plans to incorporate user certificates into its Norton-branded consumer products, creating a new consumer business that allows users to easily create secure identities that can be authenticated when they do business online.\nExecutives said that VeriSign's authentication and identity management technologies could also be applied to the growing number of consumer devices, as more mobile and remote workers rely on their own devices in the workplace.\nVeriSign is renowned for its SSL Certificate Services, which provide a trusted mark of authentication for Web sites that users visit. The VeriSign check mark indicates that the Web site is legitimate and ensures users that financial transactions are encrypted and secure.\nThe company claims that more than a million Web servers use VeriSign certificates while it processes more than two billion certificate checks daily.\nMeanwhile, security experts say that unlike other smaller, high-dollar purchases Symantec has previously made, the VeriSign acquisition won't likely yield excessively high revenue growth.\n\"VeriSign spent the last two years divesting non-core businesses to focus on its identity and authentication businesses,\" said Allan Krans, senior analyst for Technology Business Research, in an e-mail. \"VeriSign&#8217;s revenue growth averages in the single digits, and with a large revenue base it will be difficult to consistently grow double-digits even after joining Symantec.\"\nHowever, VeriSign will likely bring significant operating profit to the security giant, Krans said, in light of the fact that it has maintained more than 30 percent operating margins. \"VeriSign&#8217;s margin profile is well matched to Symantec&#8217;s Security and Compliance segment, which consistently reports operating margins in the 20 percent to 30 percent range. Symantec is buying value, both in VeriSign&#8217;s strong security brand and margin profile,\" he added.", "Harsin didn\u2019t offer specifics on any individuals, but said the format was mostly first-team offense versus first-team defense; same with the second and third teams.

So why do we do it? Deirdre Hynds gets behind the psychology.\nChristmas is an emotionally charged time of year. It\u2019s a dizzying mix of family and school reunions, work parties, Secret Santa duties, reconnaissance missions to the attic for decoration retrieval, and of course the retail rollercoaster experience of Christmas gift shopping. The pressure is on to feel happy and joyous, but the excessive consumer-driven focus very often leaves us feeling stressed, depleted, and of course - broke. In spite of our best efforts to protect ourselves from abusing our bodies and our bank balances, we continue to trample familiar territory, spending money we don\u2019t have and partaking in gluttonous gorging at the festive trough.\nWhile we are accountable for our own well-being, we are not totally to blame for Christmas induced consumerist hedonism.\nHuman beings are social animals, linked together by shared beliefs and values. This is both a weakness and a strength. Brands use this fact against us by tapping into the pulsing collective mass of our shared fears, hopes, desires and anxieties and the consumer blind spots which offer the greatest opportunity for exploitation are related to the murky area of emotions and feelings.\nEven those predisposed to the most sober of temperament will allow themselves the indulgence of seasonally induced nostalgia; however, our wistful walks down memory lane are often driven by brands who attempt to harness the powerful feelings created by this intensely personal experience. The word \u2018Nostalgia\u2019 comes from the Greek nostos, to return home, and algia, a painful condition. It is often described as a \u2018bittersweet\u2019 experience, a sense of happiness tinged with longing or sadness.\nResearch has suggested that the areas in our brain that are connected to memory and novelty are activated and coordinate to reward us when we trigger feelings of nostalgia. This reward occurs as nostalgia is subject to embellishment, often treating the experiencer to distorted perceptions that lead to an idealised recollection of one\u2019s own past, highlighting the positive effects of being. It is this positivity that brands want to be associated with, so they prompt and prime a nostalgic response from consumers by using decades old advertisements, or relaunching vintage classics to encourage them to associate happy experiences from their past with the brand\u2019s selected product.\nWhen it comes to emotions in general, we find them confusing, that\u2019s why psychotherapy and psychiatry are thriving industries.\nBrands use tropes and techniques designed to encourage nostalgic thinking, but also to elicit joy, excitement, worry and guilt. A mood experienced by an individual is often treated like a piece of product information in an advertisement. When you hear the Coke Christmas jingle it may make you feel excited and happy, and although that happiness relates to the feelings Christmas may have sparked in you as a child, our brain finds it hard to identify and distinguish the exact source of the good mood. Advertising works by directing your brain to associate the good feeling with the brand or product, which will inevitably guide your decisions when you shop.\nAnd when it comes to Christmas, we shop a lot! In fact the shopping element of Christmas, and the requirement to find the perfect gift, can often be the most stressful part of the festive season. This can tarnish the benefits of gift giving which is inherently positive as it enables expressions of appreciation and reinforces established relationships. Why then do gifters experience an intensely felt sense of anxiety when faced with the reality of their shopping list? It is caused by a desire to please the recipient but a doubt that it is achievable. Gift giving is strongly related to the givers own identity. Once an individual invests energy and thought in choosing a gift, the item becomes \u2018charged\u2019 with the energy of that gifter, which results in an unintentional purchase of a gift that is more reflective of the gifter\u2019s tastes or intentions, than the personality or taste preferences of the person the gift is intended for.\nThis specific type of gifting exemplifies \u2018signalling\u2019, which is behaviour motivated by the belief that certain actions will convey particular information about the individual self to others.\nSignalling can be driven by the need to feel a sense of belonging, the need for self-expression and the need for self-enhancement.\nSignalling relates to the area of needs, and needs are something that every human being shares. Advertising and marketing work by converting, both conscious and unconsciously, needs into wants, for example, \u2018I need food\u2019 \u2013 \u2018I want a Dominos\u2019, \u2018I need respect and admiration from others\u2019 \u2013 \u2018I want a BMW\u2019. Most of our consumer purchasing choices are driven at an unconscious level by these needs. It gets really confusing when we don\u2019t really understand the origin of our mood. An individual may be experiencing loneliness, isolation or regret, particularly during the emotionally charged period of Christmas. Brands are usually one step ahead of us having already converted a vague but keenly felt need for social connectedness, love, or belonging, into a want for their product.\nOvereating at Christmas is hard to limit, but there is a really simple biological hack to avoid it, which is to limit the amount of choice you have available in the house. Humans are designed to seek as much variety in our diet as possible to get all of the nutrients we needed to survive. Unfortunately this biological fact was designed to help us survive drought and famine, and because we now have access to any type of food we want at any time, we tend to overeat. Stock up the house with goodies, just avoid buying unnecessary multiple varieties of each. And no-one, especially Cadburys, Nestle and Mars et al, wants to hear it but avoid stocking up the larder with multi-selection boxes of sweets.\nEconomist Richard Thaler famously challenged what he termed The \u2018Econ\u2019, the notion of a rational human being who relies on scientific reasoning and evidence when making decisions. Thaler and his colleagues have continued to demonstrate the fallacy of this mythical being. Humans don\u2019t always make sensible choices, we do things that harm ourselves and each other on both a domestic and international scale.\nIn particular, when it comes to decision-making, humans demonstrate a forward planning defect. We lack the ability to relate to our future self with a sense of empathy, research has demonstrated that we think about our future selves coldly, similar to how you might regard a stranger.\nTo enable ourselves to make better long-term decisions we must try to cultivate what is called \u2018proscriptive planning\u2019 and generate a very basic sense of kindness towards our future self. Take the time before the festivities commence to visualise yourself sitting down to look at your bank balance in January. Imagine very clearly how it might feel to be in debt, or short on cash. This will help you to generate a sense of compassion towards your future self, promote considered consumerist behaviour, and mitigate unnecessary spending.\nEnjoy feeling nostalgic, and reflecting on time gone by, but use the sentiments productively to reach out to friends and family if you are in a position to do so. Organise holiday meet-ups, family walks, or just pick up the phone and give that person from your past a call. It will satiate your basic human need for social connection, which should reduce the urge to spend to fill this gap.\nAvoid getting swept up in a festive frenzy by curtailing social media use where you may be exposed to peers who post details about Christmas shopping, which may place you under pressure to act in a similar fashion to them. Turn off alerts or simply choose to hide comments from likely candidates.\nThink about this, can you remember all of the presents that were bought for you last year? Or ask the people you bought presents for if they can remember the gift you spent a lot of time and money on? Studies suggest that the best gifts to buy people are experiences; like a ticket to a gig, or a cookery class, because of the greater emotion evoked when the recipient experienced the gift (in effect they get two gifts, one when they open the present, and again when they actually experience it). Even better again, buy something you can both do together, research shows that shared experiences are more enjoyable and remembered for longer periods of time. An added benefit of this is that you are unlikely to spend money on items which are due to be discounted once the sales start in January, so you can avoid the post- purchase funk!\nCreate your own Christmas countdown calendar and fill it with things that bring you joy and fulfilment, not stress and anxiety. Try to be organised, make that list and check it twice! Avoid last minute panicked over-spending, and remind yourself that the \u2018x sleeps to Christmas\u2019 messages are a promise, not a threat.", "April 13, 2019 \u2014 The Florence Area Community Coalition (FACC) held its annual volunteer appreciation event on Wednesday to honor the hundreds of volunteers and dozens of organizations who share their time and resources in the Siuslaw region.\nFACC reported that there were 608 volunteers associated with groups such as Siuslaw Valley Fire and Rescue, the Friends of the Siuslaw Public Library, the Friends of the Florence Events Center, Florence Food Share, Siuslaw Outreach Services and dozens of other organizations.\nThe volunteers logged 35,113 hours in the past year, equaling the equivalent of $377,465 at minimum wage.\nWood polled the audience to see how long individuals worked with specific organizations.

This hamlet, renowned for its ancient hanging coffins, prehistoric limestone caves, underground waterways, and time-honored hand-weaving tradition, is now also famous for its surprisingly good food, a twist of fate that occurred about a decade ago. Nowadays, a number of intrepid travelers journey to Sagada just for the food!\nTo reach Sagada is a bit tricky, especially on a rainy day in a shroud of fog. Our journey began in Baguio, in a drizzling rain which rapidly morphed into a downpour. As our car slipped and slid on the muddy roads I held my breath, clutched my husband\u2019s hand, and prayed. Around sharp curves, I leaned towards the mountain, hoping that my weight would somehow spare us from rolling off the side of the cliff. My two children, glued to their portable movie screens in the back seat, were blissfully oblivious to the vertiginous terrain. After eight long hours of back-aching, bladder-bruising bumps, we finally reached Sagada. I now understand why the pass between Bontoc and Sagada is affectionately called Abortion Road.\nWe checked into the Olahbinan Hotel and wobbled our stiff legs to St. Joseph\u2019s Rest House and Inn where we dined on vegetarian spaghetti, pancit, and roasted native chicken. I realized that it was the vegetables \u2013 tasty, crunchy, and perfectly fresh \u2013 that made everything taste so good.\nThe next morning, our 6 a.m. wake-up call came from a rowdy rooster. As advised by friends, we went to the Yoghurt House for a scrumptious breakfast of crepe-like pancakes filled with homemade Greek-style yogurt and sliced bananas. The walls of this cozy joint are a gallery of photographs of local sights and people worth climbing over customers to see.\nFortified, we picked up our 39-year-old guide, Pep, at City Hall. First stop: Eco Park to see the hanging coffins. The oldest is more than 200 years, and the newest was mounted against the limestone cliff in 2007. I was equally fascinated by the hanging chair on top of the coffin and asked Pep to explain. \u201cThat\u2019s for the spirit of the deceased to rest,\u201d he said. In another source, I read that a cadaver was tied to the death-chair so family and friends could say goodbye, ask for final blessings or solutions to problems, or voice their requests. Both sources are probably correct on some level.\nMarket day was reaching full swing as we drove back through the town. The main drag was abuzz with vendors perched under their colorful beach umbrellas hawking everything from car batteries and toilet paper to dried fish and gorgeous organic produce. Babies were strapped to their mothers, who were busy shopping for the week. Market day only happens on Saturdays in Sagada.\nNext stop: Sumaging Cave. I\u2019m not into spelunking, but I\u2019m also not about to miss out on an adventure either. Holding a kerosene lamp on his head, Pep led us into the dark grotto. Barefoot, with splayed toes clinging to rocks like a lizard\u2019s, he scaled and jumped from rock to rock. And, like a trail of ants, we followed his footsteps, trying our best to maintain traction on the slippery bat poop. My one bit of advice regarding Sumaging Cave is: Don\u2019t stop half-way through like I did and miss seeing the miniature lake. Reports from the rest of my group described the crystal clear pool and glistening, sandpaper-textured rocks as \u201cawesome, way cool, and worth a trip back.\u201d I began to sulk.\nBut my spirits were instantly revived by a side-trip to Pep\u2019s brother\u2019s apiary, where bees in 60 houses make 200 kilos of light-golden sunflower honey every year. Pep\u2019s brother, Man, an engineer by trade, gave us a brief lesson in honey production.\n\u201cTiming is critical. You must get honey when it\u2019s hot and the bees have less energy.\u201d Perfect logic one could apply to human life as well. He went on to say that if bees feast on coffee plants, the honey is darker. I bought 20 jars, most to give as gifts. I\u2019m still enjoying my stash.\nAfter the honey, we viewed more hanging coffins (some with visible bones through termite-eaten holes), until finally, it was time for dinner. Luckily, without reservations, we managed to squeeze into the Log Cabin Restaurant, which friends had told us is a must, only they forgot to mention that reservations are required. Dave Gulian, the owner, a kind and soft-spoken gentleman, must have read the desperation on my face.\n\u201cDo you mind sharing a table in the kitchen?\u201d Dave asked.\nWhen I stepped into the Log Cabin\u2019s kitchen, the warmth and smells of roasting pork and baking bread made me homesick. I expected to see my mother behind the stove whipping together one of her famously delicious family dinners in her New Hampshire kitchen.\nI marveled over the offerings at the buffet: pork loin with blueberry-cinnamon sauce and golden-roasted potatoes, carrots with sunflower honey, tomatoes with watercress and fern salad, creamy chicken tarragon, locally-grown organic red rice, broccoli-and-cauliflower gratin, eggplants and tomatoes, home-baked whole wheat bread with sweet butter, all topped off with a decadent chocolate nougat cake and indigenous Arabica coffee and mountain tea. I gleefully did what all of the other diners were doing, and helped myself to a taste of everything.\nOur tablemates, a charming couple from the British Embassy, arrived with their two friends visiting from France. We shared our driving nightmares, cave adventures, and hanging coffin stories over red wine. Dave stopped by our table and explained that the Log Cabin Restaurant opened almost 20 years ago. The elusive French chef, who creates the magic behind the stove, arrived in Sagada about eight years ago (lucky for us he decided to stay).\n\u201cWhat inspired you to open this restaurant?\u201d I asked Dave.\n\u201cNo restaurants were around twenty years ago. We planned to make a restaurant for tourists and locals. The other restaurants in town opened about ten years ago. We have customers who come all the way from Manila just for our Saturday dinner buffet,\u201d he said.\nGood food and good wine shared around a table with new friends and lively conversation in the middle of nowhere \u2013 life just doesn\u2019t get any better.\nOh, and thank you Dave for squeezing us in and making the bone-breakingly bouncy ride to Sagada worth the trip.\nLog Cabin Restaurant seats 53 diners at one seating at 7 pm. Open every night for dinner. Buffet dinner only on Saturday nights. Book at least 2 weeks in advance. They also have one room available in their Inn. Book that one month in advance.

On the back of the bus was a tourism plug for Tucson, Ariz., featuring an attractive woman, a rocky desert landscape and a QR code. Yes, a QR code. On the back of a city bus.\nAs I\u2019ve said before, I think mobile barcodes have immense potential. But as I drove behind the bus I wondered how people would actually use that QR code, which presumably takes users to a mobile site for a Tucson tourism organization. Was I supposed to drive closely enough to the back of the bus to scan the code with one hand on my phone and the other on the wheel? Should pedestrians bolt into the street to try to capture the image at bus stops?\nPC-type mobile sites: Building a good mobile site doesn\u2019t simply mean squeezing your content down to fit a smaller screen; it means addressing the differences in websites are used across different devices. For instance, a consumer is likely to check an airline\u2019s website on a PC to compare fares or change seat assignments. But a mobile user is more likely to check the status of a flight. So that option should be presented to mobile users immediately \u2014 not after a few clicks or buried at the bottom of the screen. And never ask a mobile user to enter more than a few words from his handset to sign up for a mailing list, say, or create an account.\nOver-reach: Once you\u2019ve established a relationship with a consumer, don\u2019t bombard her with come ons. If she has signed up to receive product announcements or sales alerts, give her those, but nothing (or not much) more. And always, always make it as easy to opt out as it is to opt in.\nBluetooth-based surprise assaults: Spam is a particularly bad idea on a mobile phone, which (as you\u2019ve heard countless times) is the most personal device consumers carry. And an unsolicited message asking if I want to receive a message is as annoying as sending me the message in the first place. If you must market via Bluetooth \u2014 a practice I generally can\u2019t stand \u2014 make sure you\u2019re doing it from clearly marked locations (like a kiosk in a movie theater) that will reach a targeted population rather than everyone who happens to walk by your storefront.\nFailing to leverage the phone\u2019s functionality: Any local search campaign should include a click-to-call feature that can connect advertisers and would-be customers with a single touch. And phones are location-aware devices that also serve as cameras, music/video players and messaging devices. Find innovative ways to entice consumers to use some of those features as you interact with them.\nSiloed campaigns: Mobile works best when it\u2019s part of larger campaigns that embrace a variety of media as well as social networks. (Ubisoft last year leveraged Facebook and Twitter effectively in this mobile marketing campaign for the game Splinter Cell: Conviction.) Place QR codes in print, online and on billboards (but, um, not on buses) to establish a new line of communication with consumers. If you\u2019re a brick-and-mortar retailer, use in-store displays to make sure your customers know about your mobile website. And use traditional media to encourage users to reach you via short codes.\nBuilding only an iPhone app: Developing mobile apps isn\u2019t always a great mobile marketing strategy, particularly for those on a shoestring budget. Only about one-third of all mobile users in the U.S. own smartphones, according to recent data from Nielsen, and only about one-fourth of those carry an iPhone. So an iPhone-only app will reach a very small segment of the market. If it\u2019s worth building for iOS, it\u2019s also worth building for Android \u2014 and probably BlackBerry.\nWhat other pitfalls should mobile advertisers avoid?", "There will be all kinds of connections between Kentucky and Louisville when the teams face off Saturday at Commonwealth Stadium.\nUK offensive linemen Justin Jeffries and Matt Smith were high school teammates of U of L running back Victor Anderson and fullback Joe Tronzo at St. Xavier. Several players from Trinity are on both teams, including UK punter Ryan Tydlacka and U of L backup quarterback Will Stein.\nAnd UK sophomore safety Winston Guy was a young sophomore teammate in 2005 when Louisville starting quarterback Justin Burke was running the show for a Lexington Catholic team that won the Class 3A state championship.\nGuy had a flashback to the season opener that year, when an Anderson-led St. X team nipped Catholic 37-34. Burke threw for 289 yards and four touchdowns, and Anderson rushed for 171 yards, caught two passes for 41 yards, and had 93 yards in kick returns.\nBut Guy knows he'll have to put all that aside once the chin straps get snapped.\n\"We're enemies on the football field but, once the game's over, we can be friends just like we were,\" Guy said. \"Before the game, you see each other, shake hands, wish each other good luck but, once that clock starts, it's game time.

But Consumer Reports says a new type of credit scoring system called UltraFICO may help those just starting out get that first critical credit card.\nTo get a credit card, you need a credit score. The main system banks use \u2014 FICO \u2014 bases its score on how well people have handled loans in the past. But what if you\u2019ve never taken out a loan? The UltraFICO system, which will debut this summer, won\u2019t depend on loan history.\nUltraFICO is going to base its score on how people use traditional savings and checking accounts. Those kinds of accounts are easy to set up with just a cash deposit. So they can be a good choice for people with a weak credit history or none at all to build up their credit.\nBut Consumer Reports cautions that you\u2019ll have to share confidential information about your banking accounts, such as how often you withdraw and deposit. And it\u2019s still unclear whether lenders will buy into the UltraFICO score.\nConsumer Reports has another concern that making credit easier to get may cause some people to get in over their heads and then they may not be able to pay back their debt. But Consumer Reports says the UltraFICO scoring system isn\u2019t necessary for people who already have good credit and well-established credit histories. They should stick with the traditional FICO scoring system.", "So what does Crossfy do and who\u2019s behind this new product?\nCrossfy may be debuting, but its creators aren\u2019t. Well known in the Brazilian startup community, its CEO Amure Pinho is also the founder of Sync Mobile. Based in Rio de Janeiro, the startup initially focused on developing apps and other mobile solutions.\nYet, its scope is now much more ambitious, and includes creating interactive, AR-based experiences \u2013 for instance, it was responsible for what it describes as \u201cthe first newspaper in the world with an LCD screen,\u201d in partnership with a Brazilian media group.\nDeveloped by Sync\u2019s in-house team, Crossfy is based on the same vision, but takes it one step up \u2013 hence Sync\u2019s decision to launch it as a standalone product, with its own name and branding.\nIn the same way that Google Goggles lets you \u2018search what you see\u2019, Crossfy\u2019s technology identifies printed ads and images to give access to associated digital content, from text and audio to video.\nAccording to the startup, its approach is based on visual computing concepts that let it recognize patterns in any printed image. In other words, Crossfy could do away with the need for QR codes and markers, which means it is quicker and more convenient to use, both for the readers and for the publishers.\nPublishers and newspapers are indeed Crossfy\u2019s core target. As a matter of fact, Pinho says his new company already has deals in place with four clients, including two newspapers and one book.\nIt doesn\u2019t mean Crossfy is thinking small \u2013 the company hopes to distribute its products across the world, and already closed deals with representatives in Argentina, Australia and Russia.\nWhile Crossfy can be used to enhance print ads, this is only one scenario, Pinho points out. For readers to keep on using the system, publishers will have to promote engagement, and offer content that is fully relevant to their readers. \u201cNobody wants to test a technology and find out it\u2019s only one more way to sell a specific product or service,\u201d he says.\nThis isn\u2019t blind optimism; while newspapers are suffering greatly in the US, their circulation in Brazil has actually increased. While Crossfy\u2019s success will also depend on the accuracy of its image recognition, this different perspective is an interesting plus when it comes to inventing the future of content consumption.\nWhat would it take to convince you to access additional content when reading a newspaper?

One of the most recent additions to the roster is a woman \u2013 a lesbian, in fact \u2013 whose name may mean nothing to you but who, like Weinstein in Hollywood and Franken on Capitol Hill, has long wielded considerable power within her own professional community. Her name is Avital Ronell, and she's a 66-year-old \u201csuperstar\u201d professor at New York University, where she's a member of both the Germanic Languages and Literature Department and the Comparative Literature Department, and at the European Graduate School in Switzerland, where she's on the philosophical faculty.\nRonell's accuser, a young gay man named Nimrod Reitman, alleges that back in 2012, when he was one of Ronell's grad students, she sexually assaulted him at her pied \u00e0 terre in Paris, proceeded to flood his in-box with scores of romantic e-mails, and then, some time later, moved into his Manhattan apartment (and bed) when Hurricane Sandy cut off the electricity to her NYU apartment. When, after his graduation, he finally began resisting her aggressive moves \u2013 he says he was too worried about professional retaliation to do so earlier \u2013 she allegedly tried to sabotage his career.\nA prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the late Jacques Derrida, Ronell practices what is known, broadly, as postmodern theory, churning out prose \u2013 at once playful, pretentious, and deliberately obscure \u2013 that's meant to be a shot across the bow of the rational post-Enlightenment West. Half a century or so ago, professors in English departments taught literature. Philosophy professors taught the history of philosophy. Their present-day successors, such as Ronell, whom you can put in any and all humanities and social-sciences departments, because they're all working pretty much the same scam, view themselves as doing something infinitely more consequential than passing on the great ideas of Western civilization.\nAround the world, colleagues of Ronell leapt at the chance to go to bat for her, though they didn't exactly echo her own apologia. One of them, Lisa Duggan, a Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis at NYU, responded to the trove of sugary electronic billets-doux supplied by Reitman as evidence of Ronell's obsession with him by suggesting that just as Ronell's books are intentionally elusive to the common reader, so are those e-mails. They're \u201cgay-coded,\u201d articulating \u201c[f]orms of intimacy well outside the parameters of heterosexual (and, homosexual) courtship and marriage.\u201d In other words, if you or I think that Ronell sounds girlishly smitten when she addresses Reitman as \u201cSweet cuddly Baby\u201d or \u201cmy most adored one,\u201d it's because we're not sophisticated enough readers.\nProfessor Ronell has changed the course of German Studies, Comparative Literature, and of philosophy and literature....She is responsible for building the field of literary studies...throughout Europe....Her students now teach at leading research institutions in the US, France, and Germany, and her intellectual influence is felt throughout the humanities, including media and technology studies, feminist theory, and comparative literary study.....As you know, she is the Jacques Derrida Chair of Philosophy at the European Graduate School and she was recently given the award of Chevalier of Arts and Letters by the French government.\nIt's crystal clear what this letter is about. In a word, power. It's an appeal to the power of top-level university authorities to squelch an abuse allegation. It's an attempt to awe those authorities with the power of famous names and impressive affiliations. And it defends Ronell not (as she did) by invoking her purported victim status but by, on the contrary, and with immense irony, emphasizing her mighty position within what her defenders, in their writings and classrooms, would describe as the West's nefarious power structures.\nIn short, Ronell's academic allies were quick to try to wield their collective power, and Ronell's, to save her from a fair and objective reckoning. They also \u2013 no small detail \u2013 sought to destroy Reitman, whom they accused (without any hint of proof whatsoever) of mounting a \u201cmalicious campaign\u201d against her. In behaving like this, of course, these soi-disant ivory-tower diagnosers of the West's moral, cultural, and intellectual debilities were no different from the slimy Tinseltown executives, producers, and journalists who, over the decades, conspired to suppress unpleasant rumors about the almighty Harvey Weinstein and to silence one after another of his inconsequential victims.\nThe good news: NYU has suspended Ronell for a year \u2013 not much of a punishment, but better than nothing. Butler, who like Ronell is worshiped in the academy for her calculatedly enigmatic prose, backed off from the NYU letter (which she reportedly composed herself), saying that it had been \u201cwritten in haste,\u201d that it \u201cought not to have attributed motives to the complainant,\u201d and that \u201cwe should not have used language that implied that Ronell\u2019s status and reputation earn her differential treatment of any kind.\u201d Ha! Remove all that from the NYU letter and there's nothing left.\nWell, that's Hollywood, folks \u2013 and it's academia, too. Bottom line: mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be humanities or social-science students, at least not at one of these wildly overrated places like NYU, Berkeley, Stanford, or (needless to say) anything in the Ivy League. As has been repeatedly demonstrated in recent years, the stuff they're offering these days is intellectually valueless; as this whole episode illustrates, these places are also well-nigh morally bankrupt and drenched in hypocrisy. All in all, frankly, your kids will get infinitely more out of a few hours of Jordan Peterson videos than out of a solid year spent in the loathsome company of the likes of Avital Ronell.", "New Delhi: Disagreeing with the centre's contention that Aadhaar has helped curb financial irregularities, the Supreme Court today said the biometric ID has been unable to stop banking frauds.\nThe remark comes against the backdrop of a spate of multi-crore bank frauds, including the one linked to celebrity designer Nirav Modi, who has been accused of defrauding the state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) to the tune of over Rs 11,000 crore.\nAadhaar is not a catch for all frauds, said Justice DY Chandrachud, one of the five judges hearing a clutch of petitions challenging the programme.\n\"When loans are given by a bank, you know the person. The loan does not become a Non Performing Asset (NPA) unless banks are hand-in-glove.

On the heels of August\u2019s DVD release of Titanic (the best way to watch the film at home, despite the fact that there are no extras on the disc) comes today\u2019s release of a new \u201cgift set\u201d of James Cameron\u2019s blockbuster, which as far as I can see is just another video of the movie with some bits of merchandise junk thrown in to entice legions of Titaniacs and Leo-heads to pour more money into Cameron\u2019s and Paramount\u2019s already bottomless bank accounts. It\u2019s a great film, one I think is destined to be a classic, but the money-grubbing is really unattractive.\nA bit of Titanic counterprogramming debuts today in the form of two new videos from Bennu Multimedia: a digitally remastered version of an early movie account of that famous meeting with the iceberg, and a companion documentary that looks at the aftermath of the disaster. Both videos are hosted by David McCallum, who appeared in the previously definitive Titanic film, A Night to Remember.\nBased on the British play The Berg, Titanic: Disaster in the Atlantic debuted in 1929, only 17 years after the great ship sank. While it naturally cannot match the lushness and grandeur of Cameron\u2019s film, it\u2019s nevertheless quite an ambitious production for the early-sound era. Indeed, this first sound film about Titanic features scenes of submerged engine rooms and ballrooms that are strikingly reminiscent of Cameron.\nThe film opens at 11pm on the night of the sinking and follows first-class passengers around as they come to grips with the disaster facing them. The gentlemen who\u2019d spent the evening drinking and playing cards and initially consider themselves \u201clucky\u201d to have seen a berg when so few do later have to deal with convincing their weepy wives and daughters to get in the lifeboats and leave the men behind. The overacting is typical of the period, as are the scenes that drag on, like someone forgot to turn off the camera after the actors had exited.\nDisaster keeps its distance from its characters, and has nowhere near the emotional heft of Cameron. But it is unexpectedly touching right at the end, as the band plays \u201cNearer My God to Thee\u201d while those left behind on the ship sing along with the hymn. Part of the reason for the film\u2019s uninvolvement for us today is the fact that the filmmakers were near-contemporaries to the event. Cameron needed Brock Lovett and old Rose to bring the calamity home for us, 85 years later, but for the original audience of this film, Titanic was, relatively speaking, snatched from the headlines, so much goes unsaid with the assumption that the audience can fill in the emotional details.\nDisaster in the Atlantic is dated, but fans of Cameron\u2019s film will find it a curious novelty.\nStills from Disaster in the Atlantic show up in The Titanic Chronicles, a pseudo-Ken Burns-style documentary about the 1912 U.S. Senate investigation into the Titanic accident. With a background of old illustrations and photos, images from Disaster, and contemporary newspaper headlines, a cast of actors, most Titanic-movie vets, dramatize in voiceover highlights from testimony given before the Senate committee by surviving crew, officers, and passengers.\nAmongst the readings: Eric Braeden (John Jacob Astor in Cameron\u2019s Titanic) portrays White Star Line representative Bruce Ismay, evading responsibility for a tragedy he helped engineer. Tim Curry (who appeared in the 1996 American TV movie Titanic) reads from Second Officer Lightoller\u2019s testimony. Marilu Henner (also from 1996\u2019s Titanic) and Gloria Stuart (Old Rose in Cameron) portray female passengers with very different takes on the behavior of the ship\u2019s officers and crew.\nThe public Senate hearings were a sensation at the time, coming mere weeks after the accident, playing to packed audiences in a ballroom at New York\u2019s Waldorf-Astoria hotel. Emotions must have run high, but not much of that comes through here. The production is a bit static, apparently limited in its choice of visual material, and the voiceovers are a bit choppy \u2014 obviously the actors did not record their readings together. And the testimony jumps around a bit \u2014 for example, the wireless operator on Titanic discusses his communications with Carpathia, the ship that eventually came to Titanic\u2019s rescue, and then without segue begins talking about another ship in the vicinity, Frankfurt. Something\u2019s been cut here without explanation.\nStill, The Titanic Chronicles has a few wonderful moments, though, ironically, they come in the words of three people not on board the doomed ship. The captain of the Carpathia speaks movingly of holding a service on board his ship for the dead after Titanic\u2019s survivors were rescued. A crewman on Californian, nearer to Titanic than Carpathia and much better situated for rescue, indicts the officers of his ship for ignoring unmistakable distress flares that later were identified as coming from Titanic. And Californian\u2019s captain (voiced by the marvelous Bernard Hill, Captain Smith in Cameron) intones in an unemotional, remorseless voice that because his wireless operator was not on duty, he never received Titanic\u2019s call for help, and insists his ship had been much too far to be of assistance anyway.\nThat said, The Titanic Chronicles isn\u2019t likely to thrill those with only a casual interest in the subject. Titanic completists should enjoy, though.", "The Facebook board member and venture capitalist defends his political endorsement in an interview at the National Press Club.\nAfter making waves for endorsing and donating to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Facebook board member and venture capitalist Peter Thiel live-streamed a defense of his actions on YouTube.\nDuring an appearance Monday at the National Press Club, Thiel reiterated his support for the Republican presidential candidate, arguing the nominee had tapped into a wellspring of discontent across the country.\n\"What Trump represents isn't crazy,\" Thiel said. \"It isn't going away.\"\nThiel's support of Trump puts him at odds with much of Silicon Valley. Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, pledged $20 million to help the election of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and other members of her party. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman offered to donate up to $5 million if Trump released his tax returns, something the real estate mogul hasn't done.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Thiel's support of Trump after the venture capitalist came under fire for pledging $1.25 million to Trump's campaign.\nThiel, a Libertarian, acknowledged at the press club that Trump isn't a perfect candidate, but suggested the media often treats him unfairly.\n\"The media has always taken Trump literally, but not seriously,\" Thiel said, whereas supporters take him seriously but not literally.\nThiel was also asked about a lawsuit against the media site Gawker that he funded. The lawsuit ultimately resulted in Gawker's bankruptcy, raising questions as to whether wealthy individuals should fund such actions.\nThe Gawker case, Thiel said, was decided by the ethics of the publication.

What's interesting to note, though, is that Wiedergruen actually didn't qualify for the 49ers first tournament of 2007-08, the Scenic City Invitational. Charlotte coach Jamie Green had to use one of two wild-card selections to bring the 23-year-old German along to Chattanooga, Tenn., where he finished tied for second.\nEven after winning the Ping/Golfweek Preview in his next start, Wiedergruen wasn't positive about his spot in the line-up. \"We're sitting in the airport after this event,\" Green recalled, \"and somebody asked him something about the next tournament and he said, 'Well, I'm not sure I'm going.' \"\nSuffice it to say, Green has a player he can rely on in Wiedergruen, who didn't sulk about being left out in the line-up during the postseason a year ago for the 49ers, but instead got to work around the greens during the summer, shoring up the weak spot in his game. \"We changed a couple of things on my grip,\" he said earlier this fall, \"and I just spent more time on the putting green than I have before.\"\nWiedergruen contends that the depth of competition on the country's No. 3-ranked team is what eventually led him to his fall success. \"It's really forces you to get better and work on your game every day,\" he says. \"If you're No. 1 all the time and don't have any trouble to stay No. 1, you probably don't have to do anything. Because it's so competitive you try to work as hard as you can and work every day to get ahead of the guys and get into the line-up. That only helps in the tournament. You know you can play well because you accomplished a lot just to make the team.\"\nFinished six strokes back of Wiedergruen at the Ping Preview en route to a fourth-place finish, but followed it up with an impressive victory at Olympia Fields and a third top-four finish at Isleworth. You get impression, too, that the best is still to come.\nIt says a great deal about the talent of the 21-year-old junior when her accomplishments have gone from being considered extraordinary to expected. With victories at the Mason Rudolph Women's Championship and the Lady Tar Heel Invitational this fall, Blumenherst now has nine college titles to her credit, only three back of Mary Anne Widman for Duke's all-time mark. With a second-place finish at the Margaret Branch NCAA Preview and a T-5 at the Stanford Intercollegiate, she now has 20 top-five finishes in 25 career starts and still hasn't ended a tournament worse than tied for 10th.\nThat's not to say that the rest of the college golf world has conceded Blumenherst a third-straight NCAA player of the year award. Arkansas senior Stacy Lewis, the defending NCAA individual champ, also had two wins this fall, and beat Blumenherst in their only \"head-to-head\" match-up at Stanford. Separating the two is like trying to decide which flavor of ice cream you like better, chocolate or vanilla. Both taste great ... it all depends what you're craving at the time.\nWe give the nod for top-player honors through the fall to Blumenherst because her stroke average is a bit lower (69.58 to 70.92) and her competition was a bit higher (Duke's strength of schedule ranks third in the country; Arkansas' ranks 30th).

Here\u2019s what to do now to prepare.\nMost government agencies don\u2019t have a dire need to implement the next generation of Internet protocols internally in the near future, but maintaining full connectivity with the rest of the world could soon require the use of IPv6, industry experts say.\nWith large allocations of IPv4 addresses still available in much of the .gov domain and the use of Network Address Translation as a way to extend the life of IPv4, there is unlikely to be a shortage of address space in the enterprise. But outside the enterprise and especially outside North America, IPv6 soon will be used to enable a multitude of new devices and services that will comprise a growing portion of the global Internet.\n\u201cThe government is faced with a real need to address the shift externally,\u201d said former National Security Agency Deputy Director Bill Crowell.\nAgencies will need to enable infrastructure that connects to the Internet for IPv6 to ensure that outside users of the protocols will continue to have access to public resources available on the Web and ensure that agencies have access to outside resources.\nGovernment officials have known for some time that the depleting pool of available IPv4 addresses will eventually require a shift to IPv6, with its much larger address space. The pool is expected to be exhausted by the end of 2011, according to most estimates, and possibly as early as the end of this year, according to others. But the move to IPv6 has been slow to take off, said Crowell, who sits on a new technical advisory board established by BlueCat Networks for its federal customers.\nPreparing for the adoption of IPv6 is one of the board\u2019s primary concerns.\n\u201cIn some respects, the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is like Y2K, except that the date keeps slipping,\u201d Crowell said. Y2K presented the threat that computers would not function properly when the calendar flipped from 1999 to 2000, but it had the advantage of a firm deadline for fixing possible problems. Not so with IPv6. \u201cFrom 2004 to 2009, it slipped quite dramatically,\u201d Crowell said.\nThe IPv6 transition is being delayed by the number of elements in the networking infrastructure, both hardware and software, that must adapt to the new protocols. Vendors are making IPv6-compliant products available, but many of the products still must make their way through the acquisition process and onto networks, and agencies don't have a specific budget for that process.\nChange might be slow in coming, but there are steps that agencies can take now to ease the way for the inevitable transition.\n\u201cOne of the things they will have to do early on is an audit of their equipment\u201d to see what is and is not ready to handle IPv6, Liu said.\nMost up-to-date desktop and server operating systems support IPv6, as do core networking equipment, such as routers. That will help the first stages of transition, which will focus on Internet-facing portions of networks. However, many elements inside the enterprise, such as printers, probably are not ready.\n\u201cThe hardest part is to identify the parts of the network that are not compatible and realize that, at some point, you will have to jettison them,\u201d Flores said.\nOne of the most troublesome areas for IPv6 compatibility is likely to be with network security tools. Those tools are starting to include functionality for the new protocols, but performance of the next-generation tools might not match that of tools already in use.\nIPv4 is not going away. Even when the new functionality becomes available, \u201cyou won\u2019t be doing IPv6 only,\u201d Liu said.\nThere are three primary techniques for handling both sets of protocols on a network: dual stacking, which allows equipment to handle both protocols; translating, which converts one set of protocols to another; and tunneling, which encapsulates packets from one set of protocols inside packets of the other.\nLiu, Crowell and Flores agree that most organizations are looking at dual stacking as the preferred method of handling diversity.\nYou will need to select management tools for your IPv6-enabled network. Those tools will need to understand and work with the new protocols. And ideally, they would be able to work with both sets of protocols so that you can have a single view of the segments that are using both IP versions.\nOrganizations not only will need to acquire IPv6 addresses but also come up with a plan for allocating them throughout the enterprise.\n\u201cThe Internet as we know it today is going to be a vastly different place five to 10 years from now,\u201d Flores said. As the private sector moves to add devices and services to online offerings, more applications will be using IPv6. Administrators will need to decide where to deploy their IPv6 addresses to accommodate new needs.\nWhether IPv6 is used internally or externally, agencies need to create a plan for implementing the protocols. Administrators will need to decide how organizations will use IPv6, what subnetworks will accommodate it and how it will be phased in.\nTraining is an area that is perpetually underfunded at most agencies and can be an unexpected expense after the hardware and software is in place. It also puts a burden on staffs that already are stretched thin, so waiting until the last minute is not a good idea.\nAdoption of IPv6 will bring both opportunities and problems for network security.\nIPv4 will not be replaced by the new protocols but will be operating alongside or on top of them. So administrators will continue to face all the vulnerabilities and threats that they already know, in addition to those created by IPv6 that they do not yet know. Many of the same lessons painfully learned will have to be relearned.\nThe availability and quality of IPv6 security tools remain in question, and the effects of new types of traffic on existing firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, antivirus, and other tools are vague. For example, the new protocols require the use of IPSec for end-to-end encryption of traffic, which is intended to be a security enhancement. But it could also interfere with requirements for monitoring traffic.\nAnd then there is the sheer scope of the transition, \u201call of which is occurring at the same time they are having to update the networks with limited funding to address security threats,\u201d Crowell said.\nIt is not all bad news for network security. \u201cOnce the conversion is done, we will see some major leaps in network security,\u201d Flores said.\nAre there any current government people pushing for this other than Kundra? Not \"former\" who are probably now contractors looking for a new cash cow for their new employer? I'm all for IPv6 but these guys you quote are foxes in a henhouse. There are solutions that won't require gateway devices costing in the 5 figures each. That's all I get from vendors but I guess that's the only way to get money out of this.", "Is Our Debt Burden Really $100 Trillion?\nWanna scare somebody about America's debt on the eve of the Fiscal Cliff? I mean, really scare somebody? Here's a trick. Don't talk about the debt. Talk about \"unfunded liabilities.\"\nThe U.S. national debt comes out to about $16 trillion today. That's something. But it's nothing compared to the extra $87 trillion in unfunded liabilities to Social Security, Medicare, and federal pensions. Here's how that works. If you add up all of the U.S. government's promises to pay retirement and health care benefits for the next 75 years and subtract the projected tax revenue dedicated to those programs over the next 75 years, there is a gap. A $87 trillion gap -- in addition to a $16 billion hole.\n\"Why haven't Americans heard about the titanic $86.8 trillion liability from these programs?\" Chris Box and Bill Archer ask in the Wall Street Journal. The authors blame the U.S. government for using shoddy accounting and for misleading the American public on their finances. In fact, the most misleading thing about that $87 trillion is the way the figure is often used in the media.\n(1) That's not our debt. Our $16 trillion in debt and our $87 trillion in \"unfunded liabilities\" represent two very different ideas: real past promises and projected future promises. Real past promises are, well, very real. We have to pay back our debt. Failing to do it would be an illegal and disastrous default. Unfunded liabilities are future promises, and, since they're not as real, we can change them whenever we want without destroying ourselves. For example, raising the taxable income ceiling and slowing the growth of benefits could reduce the Social Security gap to zero tomorrow.\nAnd that's if there is a Social Security \"gap\" to begin with. Technically, it's not legal for Social Security to have \"unfunded liabilities\" since it can only pay as many benefits as it receives in earmarked taxes. Both it and Medicare hospital insurance are prohibited from spending money they haven't collected from specific revenue dedicated to their programs (i.e.: payroll taxes). It is impossible for either to technically be \"unfunded\", since they cannot legally outspend their funding.\n(2) 75-year projections are scarier than they are informative. Seventy-five-year projections always sound gargantuan because, well, they're calculated over three-quarters of a century, which is an awfully long time to count anything. But here's the flip side: In 75 years, our economy will be massive. Growing slowly at a 2% annual average, our GDP would be $66 trillion in today's dollars in 2087. That's an incomprehensibly big number, too. Once you run out any number over 75 years, the mind starts to boggle. That's good for scaring people with mind-boggling numbers, but it's not so good for informing. When Republicans say unfunded liabilities come out to $520,000 per U.S. household, they're taking a figure from 2087 and dividing it over a 2012 population to exaggerate. Scary, to be sure, but not very informative.\n(3) Projections can change fast. An unfunded liability is a projection, and projections shift all the time for two big reasons: (1) Circumstances change and (2) laws change. Let's take circumstances first: The shortfall in Medicare and Social Security is exquisitely sensitive to just about every demographic trend you can imagine, including longevity, immigration, income growth, and birth rates. Furthermore, it assumes that seven decades of innovation will do nothing to change the rate of health care inflation, which is a brave assumption. We know next to nothing about how medical inflation will change after this decade. The fact that actuaries pretend to know the future doesn't make them oracles. It just makes them dutiful actuaries.\nNow, about our laws. Strictly speaking, the U.S. doesn't have an entitlement problem, or even a Medicare problem. Rather, we have a health care cost problem -- medical insurance and hospital costs and so on are getting expensive faster than our ability to pay for them. Medicare and Medicaid are part of this big expensive system. If we cut these programs without changing the system, we won't be \"saving\" money, so much as shifting costs to old folks, who will be forced to pay much more for their health care, or else see much worse coverage.\nWhat can we do? We can get quantitative, and we can get creative. Getting quantitative means finding the fairest ways to raise revenue and cut benefits to close the foreseeable Medicare gap. Getting creative means firing a quiver of ideas at the health care inflation monster, like exchanges and advisory boards and innovation centers and laws nudging insurers to pay for health outcomes rather than gratuitous services.\nClosing this liability gap -- whether it's $87 trillion or $8 trillion -- will require patience. The bad news is that none of these measures to fix our real problem (health care costs) will be easy, few of them will be initially popular, and most of them might not work. The good news is we have 75 years.", "Have you ever lost your laptop? If not just imagine that one day your laptop is no longer in your possession.

Led by India opener Rohit Sharma, this franchise is the only team to have won the IPL thrice. Kolkata Knight Riders (2012 and 2014) and Chennai Super Kings (2010 and 2011) have won the competition twice while Rajasthan Royals (2008), Deccan Chargers (2009) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (2016) have won the trophy once.\nRohit, along with all-rounder Hardik Pandya and pacer Jasprit Bumrah were retained by the franchise. Mumbai used their Right to Match (RTM) card to retain all-rounders Kieron Pollard and Hardik's elder brother Krunal Pandya. Krunal was their costliest purchase for Rs 8.8 crore in the IPL Auction held in January.\nRohit has a repository of quality players at his disposal, both national and international players.\nDespite their new-look team, Mumbai have lost some key performers over the years. Nitish Rana, who was a vital cog in Mumbai's wheel last season, will be playing for Kolkata Knight Riders. He scored 333 runs in 13 matches including three half-centuries with a highest score of unbeaten 62.\nVeteran off-spinner Harbhajan Singh also played a vital role in Mumbai's pursuit of the title last season. He took 8 wickets in 11 matches last year for Mumbai.\nHarbhajan will be playing for Chennai Super Kings this season.\nHaving said that, Mumbai will have a pool of young talent in form of domestic players like young Ishan Kishan, Surya Kumar Yadav and Siddhesh Lad. These three newcomers could come in handy for the Rohit-led team.\nBig players like Rohit, Hardik, Pollard, Pat Cummins and Mustafizur Rehman can turn any match in their favour.

Washington, D.C., is considering legislation to adopt a similar program.\nCarl Ayers, director of family services for the Department of Social Services, said baby boxes, which have been provided to expectant parents in Finland since the 1930's, are far from new technology.\n\"These are gussied up cardboard boxes,\" he said. \"But we feel like the baby boxes, in conjunction with safe sleep message for parents, are what families need to protect their young children.\"\nBaby boxes are being embraced by a growing number of policy makers and hospital administrators, interested in the low-cost approach to promoting safe sleep. Typically, the company provides the boxes for free, based on a business model that some parents will return to them as customers and purchase baby supplies from their web site.\nIn January, New Jersey became the first state to launch a universal program providing every new mother with a baby box along with training about safe sleep habits. Since then, statewide programs have been launched in Alabama, Ohio, Texas and Colorado.\nIn some states, the programs are government-led. In others, they are being organized by hospital systems or community agencies, while government agencies debate about the potential risks and benefits of adopting a program that has little research base.\n\"We're certainly interested in seeing what the research shows, but there is not enough evidence at this time for Texas to distribute or endorse baby boxes,\" said Chris Van Deusen, spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services.\nAs enthusiasm grows for baby boxes in the United States - The Baby Box Co. is poised to distribute more than a million boxes next year - many in the medical community are questioning the safety of the boxes, which are not regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, and questioning their effectiveness at reducing infant mortality rates.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome recently issued a public statement citing a death of research on the outcomes related to baby boxes, even in Finland, where boxes have historically been given out as an incentive to access prenatal care early in pregnancy, and it's not clear whether the nation's low infant mortality rate is due to its baby boxes or broader system of care for new families.\n\"Finland has universal health care, a robust visiting nurse system for families who just had a baby, and extended maternity and paternity leave. All of these we know impact positively on infant mortality rates,\" said Rachel Moon, a University of Virginia pediatrician and chair of the task force.\n\"The U.S. has none of that,\" she said.\nThe state, working with Virginia Commonwealth University, plans to study the effectiveness of the program \u2014 examining how well new parents understand and practice safe sleep guidelines after receiving a baby box, and how their behavior changes if they receive face-to-face safe sleep education, on-line education, or receive a home visit from a medical expert.\nSleep-related deaths are by far the leading cause of unnatural infant deaths in Virginia - 80 percent of the nearly 100 infant deaths in 2013 - according to a preliminary analysis of a new child death surveillance system that the state is developing, according to the state's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.\nA 2017 report of 130 child deaths that were investigated for potential abuse or neglect in fiscal year 2016 documented more than 70 deaths that were related to unsafe sleeping environments. The report described cases where infants were found unresponsive on air mattresses or wedged into couch cushions or, more often, simply lying next to their parents in bed.\nThe baby box program in Virginia is part of a larger campaign to promote safe sleep for infants that was developed by a team of officials in Virginia that received a grant to develop solutions to reduce the number of child fatalities in the state.\nNationally, about 3,500 infants die each year from sleep-related causes. For young infants, co-sleeping with parents and sleeping on their stomachs or on soft beds puts them at risk for sudden infant death syndrome or accidental death by suffocation or strangulation.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be put to sleep on their backs in the same room as their parents but on a separate bed that has a firm mattress and is free of any loose-fitting sheets or soft cushions.\nJennifer Clary, co-founder and chief executive of The Baby Box Co. ,said the boxes have undergone extensive safety testing. She emphasized that the boxes themselves are not key to reducing infant deaths, but they are a vehicle for educating a wide swath off new parents about safe sleep practices.\n\"Parent education does reduces infant deaths. There is copious research to support that,\" she said.\nThe company's Baby Box University developed a 20-minute online tutorial, comprised of short videos with local health care providers and experts, talking about safe sleep and maternal health issues. Minute-long video segments include such topics as \"What is the difference between baby blues and postpartum depression?\" and \"How can parents support healthy brain development?\" as well as \"How do I safely use the box?\" Parents must pass a short quiz before they can receive their box.\nAlexis Simms, 24, of Richmond, took an online tutorial through Baby Box University and received a baby box through a community-based program several months ago.\nShe already had a bassinet and a crib at home but the box came in handy, she said, when she was hospitalized shortly after her daughter was born for stress-related health issues. Her relatives cared for her newborn while she was in the hospital and used the box as a portable crib.\nThe training was helpful too. She knew that babies should be put to sleep on their backs, but she did not know they could suffocate on light blankets or soft toys. She said she went home and removed all the stuffed animals and the quilted bumper that she had already used to decorate her baby's crib.\nBack at home with her baby, she said she is very conscious about keeping her now 2-month old daughter safe when she falls asleep. \"I try to put her in the bassinet as much as possible,\" she said.", "You Are Here: Home \u00bb Feature \u00bb Is Hurricane Florence Re-forming, Coming Back as Kirk?\nIs Hurricane Florence Re-forming, Coming Back as Kirk?\nSide bar\u2014 At best 42 deaths have now been accredited to Hurricane Florence, due to the highest recorded flooding on record according to officials. Nine lives lost in South Carolina, two in Virginia, and 31 fatalities in North Carolina. More than half of those killed were in vehicles.\nIt is estimated by North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper that damage will be in the billions of dollars, there is still uncertainty since the flooding is ongoing.\nLabeled Disturbance 3 by the National Hurricane Center on Friday, the small storm system was given only a 20 percent chance of re-forming into an officially named tropical depression or storm within the next five days. But 20 percent is something, and it\u2019s worth monitoring, since Florence behaved in a highly unusual manner, striking the East Coast from a position in the Atlantic that rarely occurs. And, the National Hurricane Center said in its Friday morning update, Disturbance 3 may find conditions more conducive to slow strengthening next week.\n\u201cAlthough a combination of dry air and strong upper-level winds is expected to inhibit any significant development over the next few days, the environment could become conducive for slow development when the system moves over the southwest Atlantic Ocean during the middle part of next week,\u201d the NHC said.\nIf the system reforms, it won\u2019t be called Florence again, since that name has been used and the storm has dissipated. The likely name next up would be Kirk, and it could impact the East Coast, possibly delivering more rain to the Carolinas.\nMeanwhile, parts of North Carolina and South Carolina continue dealing with widespread flooding from Hurricane Florence. Some areas received 30 to 40 inches of rain over days, and rivers are still flooding the region.\nA new round of evacuations was ordered Friday in South Carolina as the trillions of gallons of water dumped by Hurricane Florence meander to the sea, raising river levels and threatening more destruction, according to the Associated Press.", "'Scent of a Woman' stars 20 years later: Where are they now?\n\u201cThe day we stop lookin&apos;, Charlie, is the day we die.\u201d Wise words from a wise man, a blind, alcoholic colonel with a death wish to be exact! Student Charlie Simms was just looking to make an extra buck over the holiday break and the job of looking out for Frank Slade probably should have paid more. It\u2019s been 20 years since the 1992 film \"Scent of a Woman\" won Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Director and Best Actor at the Academy Awards, and our friends at Snakkle.com took a look at what the talented cast is up to now.\nAl Pacino THEN:Al Pacino\u2019s Academy Award-winning role as Frank Slade as the abrasive, and alcoholic Colonel is a memorable one. He may be blind (\u201cI&apos;m in the dark, here!\u201d), but Frank can see a lot more than some, and he won\u2019t hesitate to say so. Charlie keeps an eye on the sometimes-suicidal Frank, who ends up becoming more of a mentor to Charlie than a job.\nAl Pacino NOW: Trained in method acting, Pacino had many successes on the stage before he became the stand out film star of iconic movies like \u201cThe Godfather\u201d (1972) and \u201cScarface\u201d (1983). In 1993, Pacino and scored two Academy Award nominations: one for his lead in \u201cScent of a Woman\u201d (for which he won an Oscar for Best Actor) and another for his supporting role \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d Pacino returned to his stage roots as Shylock in the film version of \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d (2004) and now has \u201cKing Lear\u201d in the works for 2013. While he\u2019s enjoyed a number of relationships with costars and has three children from previous relationships, he has never tied the knot.\nChris O\u2019Donnell THEN: Prep school student, Charlie Simms, is on Thanksgiving break, but he needs to work to make some cash. Lucky for him, Colonel Frank Slade is in need of a caretaker; however, the job description didn\u2019t include daily verbal abuse (or advice, Frank might call it). But after Charlie saves Frank\u2019s life, Frank rescues Charlie by defending him in front of a committee looking to punish the perpetrators of a school prank.\nChris O\u2019Donnell NOW: In1990 O\u2019Donnell landed a role in the dramedy \u201cMen Don\u2019t Leave.\u201d He increased his exposure with \u201cFried Green Tomatoes\u201d and then landed \u201cScent of a Woman,\u201d for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. O\u2019Donnell then turned down the role of James Edwards in \u201cMen In Black\u201d, but his subsequent success in TV on shows like \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and most recently on \u201cNCIS: Los Angeles\u201d have kept him in the limelight. The youngest of seven children, O\u2019Donnell is now married with five children.\nGabrielle Anwar THEN: Chris notices Donna from across the room of a restaurant and Frank insists that they make their introduction. Actress Gabrielle Anwar plays the soft-spoken beauty, waiting for a date, who ends up letting the blind but debonair Frank take her for an impressive spin on the dance floor. After Frank gives him some sage advice about women to Chris, he proceeds to lead Donna in a perfect tango on the dance floor for one of the film\u2019s many memorable scenes.\nGabrielle NOW: While the English actress will always be remembered for her tango with Al Pacino, she stayed busy with acting after \u201cScent of a Woman.\u201d You may remember her as the lovely Queen Anne in \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d (1993) or as Princess Margaret in \u201cThe Tudors.\u201d With an actress mother and award-winning film producer and editor for a father, Anwar is film royalty in more ways than one. You can catch her as Fiona Glenanne in the series \u201cBurn Notice\u201d.", "Peter Crouch: This Fab gave me a game!\nPETER CROUCH was finally given a game by Fabio yesterday.\nI was so disappointed before Saturday\u2019s game to not even be on the bench.\nUnfortunately for the frustrated Tottenham striker though, it wasn\u2019t England boss Fabio Capello who put his name on the teamsheet.\nInstead it was Mars\u2019 Spanish brand manager Fabio Alings who gave Peter Crouch the chance for a kickabout at the launch of a new joint initiative with the FA to get more adults playing the game.\nGetting a game for England has been Crouch\u2019s problem recently.\nHe was disappointed not to be on the pitch let alone the bench, but has no intention of following former team-mates Ben Foster, Wes Brown and Paul Robinson who called time on their international careers under Capello.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not being involved,\u201d said Crouch.\n\u201cI was so disappointed before Saturday\u2019s game to not even be on the bench.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s the manager\u2019s decision. I found out when he announced the team at the meeting before the game, about two hours before kick- off.\n\u201cAt the back of my mind I had an inkling. Since the manager has come in I\u2019ve not had that many games. I\u2019ve felt that whenever I\u2019ve played for England I\u2019ve done well and scored goals. It\u2019s a proud moment playing for my country.\nYet for as long as Capello remains in charge it appears Crouch accepts he is likely to be a fringe player at best, despite an international scoring record most strikers in the world would kill for.

It has conducted this work by using the spare processing power of thousands of personal computers to test millions of small molecules to see if any of them might be able to inhibit the growth of a cancer cell.\nMore than 500 million separate molecules have been evaluated by Find-A-Drug, a pool from which two hundred possible candidates were identified and tested by the US National Cancer Institute. Keith Davies, scientific director of Find-a-Drug, announced on Wednesday that 42 of the 200 molecules tested showed the desired anti-cancer properties. \"Find-A-Drug has now found growth inhibitors for five anti-cancer protein targets,\" he said.\nThis success illustrates the effectiveness of distributed computing projects such as Find-a-Drug, which itself is far less powerful than some similar schemes.\nMore than 13,000 PC users have downloaded the software needed to take part in the Find-A-Drug scheme, generating more than 1,000 years of computer time.\nIn comparison, a similar project run by Oxford University's Centre for Computational Drug Discovery has already chugged through at least 225,000 years of computer time, with the support of more than 2.5 million PCs, since launching in early 2001.\nFind-A-Drug, which is a non-profit making organisation, is also looking for drugs to fight HIV and SARS.

And I said I totally understand, because I don\u2019t know if I can see it either,\u201d says the 30-year-old Moss in an interview.\nThe role was initially cast with True Blood star Anna Paquin, but the pregnant actress had to bow out. And that\u2019s when Moss got her hands on the script.\nMoss nailed the part after sending in audition tapes of some key scenes.\nThe result is that Top of the Lake is one of the best things you will see on television this year. Directed and written by Campion (who won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for The Piano) it is a display of auteur television at the height of a medium increasingly blurring the lines between the big and the small screen.\nThe series allows for the kind of long-form narrative that is impossible in a feature film. And it has the elements of the best art: a specific, narrative and place that transports viewers into a world of the other.\nThis time it is Moss who has to do the heavy lifting, since she is in virtually every scene as the star of the show.\nShe plays a complex character, at times brittle, vulnerable, tough, angry but always empathetic. It is a performance that will give rise to talk of an Emmy nomination. It was also a much more physical role than Moss was used to.\nWorking with a New Zealand accent was also a challenge for the Los Angeles-born actor.\nMeanwhile, Moss has not given up her day job.\nPeggy will return in the seventh and final season of Mad Men. And there is the question of where Moss would like her character to end up. Will the chapter close with Olson morphing into the female Don Draper as a new era emerges?", "Fusion style Khao Pad Gai.\nIt is actually a very pleasant venue, with plate glass on two sides so you can watch Siam Country Club Road and is air-conditioned. The ambience reflects the amazing d\u00e9cor and most tables are set for four covers, with one six at a squeeze. Chez Cook can seat eight diners outside and 14 inside.\nThe menu is partially hand-written and covers three pages, though the lady running the show said they are going to revamp the menu soon. The first thing that becomes obvious is the prices. The most expensive item is a T-Bone steak at B. 280 and a salmon steak B. 180, a pork chop is B. 160 and chicken breast is B. 150. Salads are B. 60-80, soups B. 40 and Thai stir-fries B. 80-150. Beers are B. 60 for a small bottle. Chez Cook describes the fare as a fusion food with Thai and European.\nMeals all came with a small container of sauce, but beware of the one with the chopped mouse poo chilli, it is very hot. Do not believe Chez Cook who said it was not hot, all said with a smile. Order \u201cmai ped\u201d just to make sure.\nBetween the three of us we had a pork chop, a chicken breast and a khao pad gai (chicken fried rice). The slices of chicken in the fried rice were large and filling. The pork chop was tender and the chicken breast was a good serving.\nWe were in a group of three and two asked for Coca-Cola, to be presented with a large bottle of coke to share. Miss Terry ordered a small bottle of beer and the crown was removed at the table with an amazing little gadget from Japan.\nChez Cook is a fun restaurant and could be described as a \u2018work in progress\u2019.

It\u2019s also ridiculous how someone so great has gone to \u2013 and won \u2013 only one Super Bowl.\nTodd Bowles can make a good case that the officials stunk, but let\u2019s get real. Not all of the Jets\u2019 16 penalties for 172 yards were on the zebras. Were there some questionable calls? Yes. Should it absolve Gang Green? No.\nThe Jets have been undisciplined for the better part of the season.\nThe bottom line: The Jets need to look in the mirror. They\u2019ve committed way too many self-inflicted wounds this season.\nThe Jets couldn\u2019t close out a game for the umpteenth time. They held 14-point leads on two different occasions in the first half and took a 15-point cushion into the fourth quarter before folding again.\nSo, why can\u2019t this team close out games?\nThink about this: Gang Green committed eight penalties for 109 yards in the fourth quarter and overtime. The Packers scored 26 points after the third quarter.\nThe wide receiver and tight end combined for 15 catches for 222 yards and two touchdowns. Anderson, who had team-highs in targets (12), receptions (9) and receiving yards (140) for a third consecutive week, is finding a rhythm with Darnold.\nHerndon\u2019s 6-catch, 82-yard showing was another solid outing for a player who is only beginning to scratch the surface of his skills.\nThe veteran has been one of the biggest surprises of this otherwise awful season. Roberts looked like he was shot out of a cannon on his 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the second quarter that gave the Jets a two-touchdown lead in the second quarter (that they would squander).", "Another morning over in the Cholera Treatment Center at Hopital Albert Schweitzer.\nPeople get very sick from cholera on weekends too.\nWe volume resuscitated many new patients this morning with IV fluids because they are too \u201cout of it\u201d to drink\u2026they have lost too much fluid from vomiting and diarrhea.

But I had to do something with him to get him some attention.\nI couldn\u2019t find the old man this morning which is usually never a good sign in Haiti. But the man that carried his gurney last night found him for me. The old man responds by shaking his head, but is too weak to vocalize words. He mouths the words, but only a whisper comes out. He has warmed up some, but his pulses are very weak. So I upped his fluids again. His IV hangs from a nail on the wall above his cot, and his daughter cleans up his emesis each time he vomits. And he vomits alot.\nOverall we probably have 200 patients in the one building, 5 tents, and lying on benches around the courtyard.\nThanks so much for leaving these blogs.

Members are torn between giving in to national GOP leaders who warn of a demographic apocalypse for the party without a plausible immigration reform bill, and their conservative constituents, many of whom are hostile to any approach short of deportation. Several of the Republicans who praised the SAFE Act on Thursday have also expressed sympathy for immigration legislation that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including Labrador, who until recently was working on a bipartisan reform bill before bailing on negotiations.\nGoodlatte suggested that these two approaches were not at odds\u2013from a policy perspective, if not politically. \u201cAny real immigration effort must guarantee that our laws be enforced following a legalization program,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s up to Speaker John Boehner to figure out how to manage the dueling instincts within his caucus.

Granular materials -- assemblages of particles that range broadly from powders to sand to microscopic beads of glass -- are one of the least understood forms of matter due to the incredibly complex ways that those particles interact. But those complicated physics also offer tantalizing potential to create materials with unique properties -- like the ability to absorb impact energy in customized ways.\nIn a paper published May 13 in Physical Review Letters, University of Washington mechanical engineers have for the first time observed and analyzed collective interparticle vibrations in two-dimensional microscale granular crystals -- a type of designer granular material.\nThis understanding and ability to predict how these tiny arrays of particles behave as forces are applied is a first step in creating novel materials that could be used for everything from impact mitigation to signal processing, disease diagnosis, or even making more controllable solid rocket propellants.\nOne of the more interesting characteristics of granular materials is that they are dynamically responsive -- when you hit them harder, they react differently.\n\"You can take a pencil and push it through a sandbag, but at the same time it can stop a bullet,\" said senior author Nicholas Boechler, a UW assistant professor of mechanical engineering. \"So in some ways what we're trying to do is build better sandbags in an informed way.\"\nThe research team discovered that microscale granular crystals -- made of spheres that are smaller than a human blood cell -- exhibit significantly different physical phenomena than granular materials with larger particles. Adhesive forces play a more important role, for instance. The array of tiny particles also resonates in complex patterns as forces are applied and they knock into each other, including combinations of up-and-down, horizontal and rotational motion.\n\"This material has properties that we wouldn't normally see in a solid material like glass or metal,\" said lead author and UW mechanical engineering doctoral student Morgan Hiraiwa. \"You can think of it as all these different knobs we can turn to get the material to do what we want.\"\nThe mechanical engineering team manufactured the two-dimensional ordered layer of micron-sized glass spheres through self-assembly -- meaning the millions of particles assemble themselves into a larger functional unit under the right conditions. Building large amounts of material composed of microscopic particles, such as a panel for a vehicle, is impractical using conventional manufacturing techniques because of the amount of time it would take, Boechler said.\nSelf-assembly offers a scalable, faster and less expensive way to manufacture microstructured materials.\nThe team then used laser ultrasonic techniques to observe the dynamics between microscale granular particles as they interact. That involves sending a laser-generated acoustic wave through the crystal and using a separate laser to pick up very small vibrations of the microscopic particles.\nResearchers have studied the dynamics of granular crystals with large particles, but this is the first time such complex dynamics have been observed and analyzed in microscale crystals, which have advantages over their larger counterparts. Their small size makes it easier to integrate them into coatings or other materials, and they also resonate at higher frequencies, making them potentially useful for signal processing and other applications.\n\"The larger systems are really nice for modeling, but can be difficult to integrate into many potential products,\" Boechler said.\nSo far, the team has conducted its experiments using low-amplitude waves. Next steps include exploring high-amplitude, nonlinear regimes in 3-D crystals -- in which the granular particles are moving more vigorously and even more interesting dynamics may occur.\n\"Ultimately, the goal is to use this knowledge to start designing materials with new properties,\" Boechler said. \"For instance, if you could design a coating that has unique impact absorbing capabilities, it could have applications ranging from spacecraft micro-meteorite shielding to improved bulletproof vests.\"", "A majority of 500 Ohio residents polled support the repeal of a five-year-old tax on satellite-delivered television services and believe the excise tax is unfair because it is not paid by cable customers, according to a survey conducted by a Columbus-based research firm and publicized by the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association.\nThe trade association commissioned the survey as a bill is pending in the state to amend a sales tax bill to eliminate the DBS levy. The repeal, sponsored by Rep. Louis Blessing Jr. (R-Cincinnati) would edit out the line taxing DBS services in a bill that applied taxes to a wide range of services, such as landscaping, hotel occupancy and product repair services.\nThe repeal was introduced in July but debate in Ohio House committees heated up in mid-November.\nWhen Blessing introduced the bill last July, he said legislators had been \u201csold a bill of goods\u201d when it was persuaded to tax satellite subscribers. Cable operators argued, as the tax was being considered, that it was unfair that terrestrial providers pay franchise fees of 5% on their gross revenues while DBS suppliers did not pay any taxes.\nBut Blessing said that franchise fees are \"an inherent cost of doing business for cable,\" adding that government has \"no business imposing additional costs\" that favor one competitor over another.\nThe law is also subject to a lawsuit, filed by providers DirecTV Inc. and Dish Network. In that challenge, Judge Daniel Hogan ruled in November 2007 that the state excise tax is unconstitutional. However, the state&apos;s Department of Taxation appealed the ruling and asked the court to allow the tax to be collected as the challenge is litigated.\nThe survey, in support of the repeal, was conducted by the Columbus-based research firm, The Strategy Team Inc. It polled 400 Ohio cable and DBS subscribers, plus another 100 homes that were known to subscribe to DBS, asking their opinion of the 5.5% sales tax on DBS bills.\nEighty-six percent of those polled said they would tell elected representatives to repeal the sales tax; two-thirds of the satellite users in the poll said a repeal is a fair remedy and would save them money.", "Pioneering British physicist Stephen Hawking passed away yesterday at the age of 76. He'll be forever remembered for both his outstanding contributions to science and the way he tirelessly championed them to the public. But we'll also remember him for his wonderful contributions to the pop culture we love - through his lifetime of cameo appearances.\nMaking appearances on everything from The Simpsons to Big Bang Theory, Hawkings' wit and humour allowed him to share his groundbreaking work in theoretical physics with even an wider audience, inspiring new generations with his passion and desire to understand the universe. As we remember him today, here are a few of our favourite moments from Hawking's vast pop culture resume.\nOn Futurama, Hawking was one was one of the series' beloved celebrity heads-in-a-jar as well as a member of Al Gore's timeline-guarding Vice Presidential Action Rangers (alongside Dungeons and Dragons creator Gary Gygax, IBM's Deep Blue computer, and Star Trek's Nichelle Nichols, naturally). Season two's \"Anthology of Interest I\" provided arguably his funniest turn on the series, thanks to his running joke of glibly taking credit for any scientific discovery he comes across - and naming it after himself - while trying to ensure Fry doesn't destroy the timeline.\nEven more than Futurama, Hawking will always be remembered for his other collaboration with Matt Groening: Four separate appearances on The Simpsons. The physicist once joked that more people knew him for these appearances than his scientific works - in particular his first in season 10's \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\", in which Hawking shows up to save Lisa from Springfield's dysfunctional chapter of Mensa in a tricked out wheelchair (that he mainly uses to punch people with a comical boxing glove attachment).\nHe'd go on to make smaller appearances in another three episodes of the show between its 16th and 22nd seasons: \"Don't Fear the Roofer\", \"Stop or My Dog Will Shoot\", and \"Elementary School Musical\", in which he rapped with Flight of the Conchords, as you do.\nHawking's most recent cameo occurred just last week, when he made his debut as the titular Hitchhiker's guide in BBC Radio 4's adaptation of the sixth novel in Douglas Adams' sci-fi series, And Another Thing..., which reveals that the Guide previously lived as the actual Hawking, keeping his voice in its latest form. You can listen to the first two episodes here.\nWhether you love or loathe the biggest nerd-sitcom on the planet, Hawking played a memorable antagonistic role to Sheldon Cooper in multiple appearances, toying with expectations to portray himself as a petty rival to Sheldon's own scientific prowess. Bet you never thought you'd hear Hawking make a joke about black holes and sucking!\nPerhaps his most beloved appearance in sci-fi, however, comes in Star Trek: The Next Generation's season six episode \"Descent, Part I\", in which a young Hawking plays himself in hologram form. Joining some of the greatest scientific minds of Earth's history - Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein - Hawking plays poker (and wins) as part of a program created by Data to better understand humanity. Hawking made several other fictional contributions to Trek (the Enterprise-D had two different shuttles named after him), but he remains the only real person to actually portray themselves in Star Trek history, outside of stock footage.", "In submitting the proposed General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 2009, Mrs. Arroyo also asked the Senate and the House of Representatives to pass a joint resolution increasing the pay of government workers.\nTo give it flexibility to address economic challenges, the government officially \u201cjettisoned our timetable to balance the budget this year in submitting the proposed GAA,\u201d he said.\nThe proposed national expenditure program is anchored on the following macroeconomic assumptions: Gross Domestic Product growth of 6.1 to 6.8 percent; inflation of six to eight percent; Dubai oil at $115 to $125 per barrel; exports growth rate of seven percent; and foreign exchange rate of P42 to P45 to the US dollar.\nThe 2009 budget is premised on revenues of P1.393 trillion, representing a 16.3-percent revenue effort, 11.4 percent higher than this year\u2019s projected take of P1.250 trillion, he said.\nOf the target, the Bureau of Internal Revenue\u2019s share is P968.2 billion while the Bureau of Customs is tasked to collect P300 billion, he said.\n\u201cLike in the past, the 2009 budget is a catalogue of rebates for the tax payments of our people. But next year the dividends will be bigger,\u201d Andaya said.\n\u201cAs to the VAT, we are instituting a 100-percent plowback policy, meaning all receipts from this tax, estimated at P111 billion next year, will be funneled to a verifiable spending menu called HEARTS for Health, Education, Agriculture, Roads, Technology and Tourism, Shelter and Security,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe need to provide the vulnerable social protection takes precedence over the satisfaction of turning in a balanced budget scorecard,\u201d he said.\nAndaya said this will be aggressive because we cannot forever rely on foreign granaries to feed our people.\nHe said the executive branch is increasing the budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) by 17.2 percent from P102.4 billion to P120 billion as roads are being built to generate jobs and, when finished, spur economic activity.\nHe said the Department of Health (DOH) will be \u201cgiven a shot-in-the-arm\u201d as its budget would be increased up to P27.8 billion next year, or an increase of 37 percent.\n\u201cBut of all the agencies, it is the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) that will receive the biggest funding hike, by 117 percent, or from this year\u2019s level of P4.8 billion to P10.5 billion next year as welfare armor,\u201d Andaya said.\nThis (increase in budget) will give DSWD more resources to provide \u201cwelfare armor\u201d in the form of conditional cash transfers and subsidies to families at risk from food and fuel prices spirals, he said.\nIn terms of prioritization of resources, social protection and investment tops the proposed budget, Andaya said.\nBy sector, the Arroyo administration is boosting the allocation for social services to 30.7 percent of the budget pie, and economic services to 25.5 percent, he said.\n\u201cBy agency, we are increasing the budget of DSWD by 117 percent, of DA-AFMA (Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act) by 56 percent, and DOH by 37 percent,\u201d he said.\nIn nominal terms, the top three agencies that will get the biggest augmentation are DepEd by P20.7 billion, DPWH by P18 billion, and DA-AFMA by 14.3 billion, he said.\nBy sectoral allocation, the Palace increased the share of economic services from this year\u2019s P299 billion to P361.4 billion next year.\nUnder this group are agriculture and agrarian reform for which the amount of P673 billion, from P43 billion this year, has been earmarked,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSocial services allocation spending, the bellwether of any social payback drive, is increased from P377.5 billion to P434 billion,\u201d Andaya said.\nIn this category is \u201ceducation, culture and manpower,\u201d with a proposed budget of P204.9 billion, up from P186.6 billion this year, he said.\nMeanwhile, Andaya sought a 50 to 100-percent increase in salaries of over a million government personnel, including the President, Cabinet members, senators and congressmen.\nHe submitted the proposal yesterday to Speaker Prospero Nograles, together with President Arroyo\u2019s proposed P1.1415-trillion national budget for 2009.\nAndaya said the government-wide pay upgrading would be undertaken over four years, starting next year up to 2012, and would cost taxpayers a total of P109 billion.", "Georgia Tech coach Paul Johnson and the Yellow Jackets are pushing to improve in 2018.\nGeorgia Tech coach Paul Johnson has experienced his share of success and failure during 11 seasons with the Yellow Jackets.\nLosing all six road games last season \u2014 including three losses by just six points \u2014 and not being eligible for a bowl game for just the second time in his tenure led to obvious frustration for Johnson.\nWith the majority of his offense intact and a new defensive scheme aimed to keep Georgia Tech in contention, Johnson\u2019s unit could be one of the most improved teams in the country next season.\nGeorgia Tech still faces challenges in the ACC and is No. 89 in Orlando Sentinel college insider Matt Murschel preseason 2018 college football rankings. Murschel ranked all 129 Football Bowl Subdivision teams in the country. The Sentinel staff takes a closer look at a new team daily, counting backward from No. 129 to our projected No. 1 team.\nLook back: It seems Georgia Tech was a play or two away from wins at several points last season. Going for the two-point conversion and ending with a one-point loss in double overtime against Tennessee in the season opener. Giving up a game-winning field goal at Miami for another one-point loss. Surrendering a late lead at Virginia.\nGT, which played only 11 games after its game at UCF was canceled during to Hurricane Irma, suffered its second losing season in three years.\nThe results prompted Johnson to hire new defensive coordinator Nate Woody from Appalachian State with hopes of turning larger deficits into manageable games and close losses into victories.\nTop returnees: QB TaQuan Marshall, BB KirVonte Benson, AB Qua Searcy, AB Nathan Cottrell, AB Clinton Lynch, LB Victor Alexander, DB A.J. Gray, LB Brant Mitchell, LB Bruce Jordan Swilling, DE Anree Saint-Amour.\nStrengths: Most of Georgia Tech\u2019s offense \u2014 nine starters to be exact \u2014 returns for next season, headlined by quarterback TaQuan Marshall (1,146 yards rushing, 17 rushing touchdowns, 10 passing touchdowns); B-back KirVonte Benson (1,053 yards, six touchdowns); and offensive linemen Parker Braun, Kenny Cooper, Andrew Marshall and Jake Stickler.\nAll of them, except for Benson, missed the spring game due to illness or injury, but they are expected to be ready for next season. The continuity should help Georgia Tech take another step in its offensive development.\nThe Yellow Jackets also expect a big season out of senior back Clinton Lynch, who has fully recovered from knee and hamstring injuries a year ago. Lynch scored 16 touchdowns his first two seasons on campus.\nWeaknesses: Georgia Tech\u2019s defensive linemen and inside linebackers will see more action in the heart of the new 3-4 defense. But the relatively inexperienced defensive backs and outside linebackers need to work on mastering the new scheme in order for the unit to click on all cylinders.\nGT has to replace production from four starting defensive backs last season in Corey Griffin, Step Durham and Lawrence and Lance Austin. And the outside linebackers must also grow accustomed to working in space, but the team remains encouraged after spring practice.\nOutlook: Johnson\u2019s team might not be in position to win its first ACC title since 2009 or appear in its first conference championship since 2014. But the grit it displayed in so many close games last season could be a solid foundation the Yellow Jackets can build on to exceed expectations during the 2018 season.", "JOHANNESBURG (AFP) - Jailed murderer Oscar Pistorius has been put on suicide watch following mysterious wrist injuries that landed him in hospital earlier this month, media reported on Sunday (Aug 14).\nPrison officials told City Press newspaper that the athlete who is serving a six- year sentence for murdering his girlfriend was under 24-hour monitoring, with increased cell visits by warders.\nSome inside sources told the paper that razor blades were found in the disgraced athlete's cell last Saturday afternoon, and that his wrist injuries, described as \"severe\", were self-inflicted.\nPrison authorities have launched a probe into the incident.\n\"Our internal investigation is at an advanced stage,\" said Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo.\nThe 29-year-old double-amputee, who is being held at the Kgosi Mampuru II Prison in Pretoria, had told prison officials he sustained the injuries falling off his bed.\nAccording to the newspaper, the injury occurred soon after he had an altercation with prison officials over medication prescribed by state doctors. The Paralympian had refused to take the medication, saying it was \"toxic\" and demanded to be given medication prescribed by his private doctor.\nHe alleged that the prison official wanted to kill him and demanded to be transferred to another jail.\nWarders also raided his cell and found a pair a scissors, prescription drugs and \"toxic pills\".\nPistorius's family has rubbished reports that the \"Blade Runner\" who made history by being the first disabled person to compete with able-bodied athletes in the 2012 London Olympics had tried to kill himself.\nPistorius initially escaped a murder conviction for shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a locked bathroom door three years ago.\nAn appeal by prosecutors saw his manslaughter conviction upgraded to murder, and in July he was sentenced to a six-year jail term.\nBut prosecutors have said they would push for a longer sentence, saying six years was \"shockingly lenient\".", "Participants in the ISP Showdown at Fall Internet World had a clear message for customers: If you want voice over IP, you won't have to wait too long. But if you want security and quality assurances, you better sit tight. Representatives from five of America's's top ISPs went head to head to debate experts, audience members and each other about the services that are and aren't on the horizon.\nParticipants in the ISP Showdown at Fall Internet World had a clear message for customers: If you want voice over IP, you won't have to wait too long. But if you want security and quality assurances, you better sit tight.\nRepresentatives from five of America's top ISPs went head to head to debate experts, audience members and each other about the services that are and aren't on the horizon.\nAlan Taffel, vice president of business and marketing development at UUNET, was the first to get hit with questions about quality of service via customer network monitoring.\n\"Monitoring software raises serious security issues in the hands of customers,\" Taffel said. But panelist Denise Pappalardo, senior editor at Network World, asked how customers are supposed to feel comfortable with the service-level agreements they've signed with UUNET.\n\"We can show them the logs and the source material if they need it,\" Taffel replied.\nIn fact, quality of service seemed to be a huge stumbling block for the ISPs. While standards bodies are hard at work developing a set of protocols, including the much-anticipated Differentiated Services (Diff-Serv), to monitor QoS across various ISP backbones, ISPs themselves seem hesitant to jump in just yet.\n\"The spaceship that is going to deliver [QoS] services hasn't landed yet,\" Taffel said. \"It's difficult to engineer these tiered services. The timeframe [for delivery] depends on third-party vendors.\"\nPSINet CEO Bill Schrader agreed that Diff-Serv and Multi-protocol Label Switching are not yet reliable. PSINet relies on frame relay and ATM in its network for quality of service.\n\"There is a cultural requirement with [Diff-Serv] that every ISP that I might connect to needs to support it,\" Schrader said. \"Until [Diff-Serv] becomes a standard, that's not going to be possible.\"\nTaffel said 1999 will be the year for advancements in QoS.\nThat is also when progress is expected in the IP telephony world, according to Kathleen Earley, vice president of Internet services at AT&T. But some ISPs questioned the role of traditional voice vendors in the up-and-coming voice over IP market.\nSchrader asked Earley if she thought IP telephony would cannibalise AT&T's voice focus.\nEarley said AT&T's voice market is mostly confined to the U.S. whereas IP offers the company a worldwide audience. \"We're No. 1 in voice in America. We're No. 1 in voice over IP in Japan, as you know, Bill,\" she said.\nVirtual private networking took its hits, too. While John Curran, chief technology officer at GTE Internetworking, was quick to tout his company's commitment to virtual private networking, he admitted that thus far the company had not announced any VPN products.\nFinally, mergers and acquisitions offered a spirited debate between MCI/WorldCom addition UUNET and the ever-independent PSINet. Taffel asked Schrader why he wanted to stay away from the popular world and acquisitions.\n\"It comes down to focus,\" Schrader replied. \"[Merged ISPs] are not focused.\"\nBut Taffel shot back that PSINet is missing out on millions of dollars in capital.\nSchrader said he wasn't worried. \"We have hundreds of millions of dollars and we can get hundreds of millions of dollars.\"", "\u201cThe Big Barn\u201d will be host to a wide variety of music this summer as part of the Yellow Barn Festival.\nAll concerts take place in the Big Barn, at 8 p.m., unless otherwise noted. Patrons can purchase tickets by calling the Box Office at 802-387-6637, by emailing info@yellowbarn.org, or by visiting www.yellowbarn.org. Advance reservations are strongly encouraged for guaranteed admission. Senior and student discounts available.\nPUTNEY\u2014On Friday, July 6, The Big Barn opens its doors for the opening weekend of Yellow Barn\u2019s 49th anniversary season with evening concerts on Friday and Saturday, plus a Saturday morning masterclass and Saturday evening discussion.\nOpening with Handel\u2019s Concerto Grosso in D Major, the first concert of the festival is a playful exploration of sonic connections between composers from varying time periods and countries, whose personal lives with music span a great distance.\nTwo pieces by John Cage follow the Handel, resulting in an unexpected view of the avant-garde Cage.\nCage\u2019s 44 Harmonies from Apartment House 1776 evoke a chorale, sonically linking to Kurt\u00e1g\u2019s J\u00e1t\u00e9kok Games and J.S. Bach Transcriptions, which appears on the second half.\nThe program also includes Morton Feldman\u2019s Structures for String Quartet, Icelandic composer Anna Thorvaldsdottir\u2019s Shades of Silence, and George Enescu\u2019s Impressions d\u2019enfance for piano and violin (Donald Weilerstein and Vivian Hornik Weilerstein).\nThe Saturday night concert opens with the North American premiere of Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara\u2019s Ballad for Harp and Strings, a dream-filled work that transports the listener to another world.\nThe second half features Johannes Brahms\u2019 Waltzes, Op. 39 for piano four-hands (Peter Frankl and Gilbert Kalish), followed by Gustav Mahler\u2019s heart wrenching and romantic Songs of a Wayfarer.\nThe program concludes with Cage\u2019s Experiences No. 2, again bringing the composer into a new light (baritone William Sharp). The piece was composed for a production of dancer Merce Cunningham\u2019s choreographed piece Experiences. The text of Cage\u2019s piece comes from poet e.e. cummings\u2019 Tulips and Chimneys.\nOn Saturdays, pre-concert discussions give audiences the opportunity to join the musical conversation that takes place among Yellow Barn musicians and gain insight into the evening\u2019s program.\nOn opening weekend, new music champion and longtime Yellow Barn faculty pianist Gilbert Kalish and Artistic Director Seth Knopp will lead a discussion about the evening\u2019s program. Saturday night discussions take place at 7 p.m. in the Putney Public Library.\nYellow Barn\u2019s opening weekend also includes a piano master class by Gilbert Kalish on Saturday, July 7, at 10:30 a.m. Yellow Barn\u2019s master classes have become mainstays of the festival, giving music enthusiasts and educators the opportunity to experience first-hand the festival\u2019s unique approach to the work and inspiration that comes from chamber music study.\nEnter the last letter of the word satellite.\nOriginally published in The Commons issue #466 (Wednesday, July 4, 2018).

The reaction would have been more or less similar had the 2017 champions Peshawar Zalmi managed to clinch the crown. That\u2019s because the crowd had come to enjoy top-class cricket more than to support a particular team. That\u2019s the reason the PSL is so much more important to Pakistan cricket than any ordinary T20 league. Termed as a \u2018resilient\u2019 PSL by the country\u2019s cricket chief, this T20 league has played a major role in giving a boost to the campaign that is aimed at bringing international cricket back to Pakistan. For ten long years since the March 2007 terrorist attack on Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore, Pakistan cricket has suffered as the country became a no-go zone for international teams. Even for the 2017 PSL final in Lahore, not many foreign stars made the trip to Pakistan. Quetta were without any of their key overseas players and were duly thrashed by Peshawar in the final. This time, however, things were different. A total of 39 foreign players made the trip to Karachi. Quetta, too, had all its key players including Australian star Shane Watson, the players of the tournament. Their full-strength team comfortably cruised to a title-winning triumph.\nThe smooth holding of the last eight PSL games in Karachi must have sent all the right signals to the cricket world. On the sidelines of Sunday\u2019s finale, ICC\u2019s chief executive Dave Richardson acknowledged that the PSL has changed the perception about Pakistan abroad. He rightly pointed out that the foreign players felt at home in Karachi. When fireworks exploded soon after Sunday\u2019s final, they were not just exploding in celebration of Quetta\u2019s well-deserved victory. It was a celebration for an entire nation which has, over the years, been one of the biggest victims of terrorism.\nIt was also a celebration of Pakistan cricket which saw several new stars in this latest season of the PSL. Players like Hyderabad\u2019s 18-year-old Mohammad Hasnain who played a key role in Quetta\u2019s victory used the PSL platform just like players like Hasan Ali and Shadab Khan did in past editions of the league. Hasan and Shadab are now big stars and household names and youngsters like Hasnain and Rawalpindi\u2019s 19-year-old spinner Umer Khan are now following suit. Plans are now being laid for a full season of the PSL on Pakistani soil next year. Prime Minister Imran Khan has given his go-ahead for it and the PCB has already begun doing its homework. It would be great for Pakistan cricket if this target is achieved.", "The Rev.

As Information Technology advances, researchers are able to create many new and revisit even more old systems in human society and in nature. These new and old systems receive tremendous amounts of new research attentions because of brand new technologies of collecting large amounts of data. Data of various formats, high dimensional point cloud or high frequency time series, or networks of many types and sizes, is collected and explored to shed new lights of authentic understanding into systems of interest.\nWhy integrative thinking is desperately needed now is because all these data formats contain complex dependence structures among and between sampled subjects and measured features. Such structural dependences consist of two closely coupled systemic characteristics: deterministic structures and inherent randomness. This concept is one well-known in statistical physics, particularly in the field of Complex System. This concept prescribes scientific endeavors in complex systems as formulating and discovering patterns of deterministic structures and mechanisms of inherent randomness.\nIn contrast, these two systemic characteristics clearly are in defiance of majority of statistical principles, concepts, modeling and bootstrapping approaches that are based on unrealistic independent and stationary assumptions. Therefore statistical investigations are commonly conducted by ignoring systemic sensitivity. This is why statistical results for complex system are likely unrealistic or even illusory.\nThe primary achievement of my research group in the past five years is that I build an integrative foundation for discovering systemic characteristics by combining principles from three perspectives of: 1) Statistical physics: I quantify the deterministic structure through the lowest energy macrostate with respect to a suitably chosen Hamiltonian; 2) Computational geometry: I develop a new computing paradigm, called Data Mechanics, by building two highly coupled Ultrametric trees on row and column axes of any data matrix to bring out its multiscale block patterns as the optimal resolution for the macrostate; 3) Information theory: I take the mutliscale block patterns as minimum sufficient statistics of Kolmogorov\u2019s algorithmic statistics, and construct algorithms for capturing mechanisms for inherent randomness within all involving blocks.\nThe computed deterministic structures and inherent randomness is then called a coupling geometry on a data matrix. Such a coupling geometry indeed embraces a matrix version of Kolmogorov complexity. Kolmogorov\u2019s two-part coding scheme then becomes the integrative principle for mimicking or bootstrapping a matrix by retaining its systemic characteristics. That is why such a coupling geometry plays the new foundation role for studying a complex system at a single phase, which is approximated by a network or high dimensional data cloud or time series.\nFor the study of an entire system, a partial coupling geometry computation is developed to compute the causal and predictive associations linking two adjacent phases. In such a fashion, an evolution of phases can be sequentially linked and studied to manifest systemic understanding.\nNetwork bootstrapping ensembles as technical devices are derived to bear with various scales of structural information, and then give rise to an energy distribution profile. This energy distribution profile becomes the base for inferring and testing hypothesis regarding systemic structure. Then a mutual energy derived from partial coupling geometries plays the role of mutual information in Information Theory to evaluate degrees of association between two adjacent phases. These computational developments are under one unified theme: Learning-From-Data.\nUnder this theme, complexity of dependence structure is not only computable, but visible. This visualization surly enhances researchers\u2019 understanding about the system as one whole. I envision the coupling geometry computing is the foundation of Data Science, and is critical in any scientific computing.\nHere we list all the real world systems investigated in my research group. They include NCAA Football League with focuses on nonlinear ranking hierarchy and systemic robustness, Rhesus Macaque monkey society with focuses on nonlinear ranking hierarchy and behavioral network interactions, winemaking system with focuses on propagating effects of water-stress on grapes to bottled wine as the ending phase, ecological and biogeographic systems with focuses of mutualism and phylogenetic effects, stock market with focused on networking among and along many dimensional high frequency time series data, and the last, but the least, one is the English words system through the Lewis Carroll\u2019s word game called Doublet, or Word-L adder .\nThe take-home message is: Via Data mechanics and its coupling geometry, systemic knowledge is computable and visible.\n1.Hsieh Fushing, C.-R.

Many drivers tweet updates throughout the week, and many teams tweet updates throughout races. But now Twitter and NASCAR have made their relationship official with a new partnership.\nThe first race that will take advantage of this new partnership will be the Pocono 400 on June 10. The race will revolve around the #NASCAR hashtag on Twitter. During the race Twitter will sift through all the tweets with the hashtag, from the teams, drivers, teams families, commentators, celebrities, and other fans and surface the best tweets and photos when you search #NASCAR on Twitter.com.\nTwitter says it partnered with NASCAR due to the fact that races end up attracting dozens of teams and and drivers, where in other sports would only attract a couple of teams at a time. It will make this experiment even more interesting.\nNASCAR fans are very active on Twitter both during races and during the week. Drivers connect with their fans on Twitter in a way that wasn't possible in the past. Last year driver Brad Keselowski tweeted photos of a crash from inside his race car while on the track. The tweets ended up gaining him an additional 100,000 followers in about two hours.\nNASCAR and Twitter will reveal more details surrounding the partnership before the Pocono 400 in June.\nIs this partnerships a harbinger of things to come? Should Twitter partner with other forms of racing in the future?

The bill would also make digital radio pay for music recorded before 1972, which some platforms have avoided paying for because of a loophole in royalty rules.\nAs it stands, the amount an artist gets paid for a radio play depends on the platform on which his or her song is played. Digital-radio services like Pandora pay one rate, while satellite radio pays another, lower rate. And traditional AM/FM radio is not required to pay royalties to artists at all\u2014they only pay songwriter royalties.\nBroadcasters say they shouldn't have to pay artists royalties to play their music on the air because of the benefits of the mass exposure that radio affords. A statement from the National Association of Broadcasters expressed strong opposition to the legislation introduced Monday.\n\"It is disappointing that this bill retreads years-old policy positions rather than advancing the copyright dialogue through policies that help grow the entire music ecosystem,\" the association's top spokesman, Dennis Wharton, said in the statement. \"NAB stands ready to work with Congress on a balanced music-licensing proposal that promotes innovation and recognizes the benefit of our free locally focused platform to the benefit of artists and listeners.\"\nBut the newly introduced bill would hold AM/FM radio to the same rules that Internet and satellite radio must follow. It would also even the playing field by making all radio platforms pay the same amount per play.\nThe bill includes protections for small and local radio stations, which broadcasters have said in the past would be harmed by a royalty requirement. Radio stations that make less than $1 million in annual revenue will only have to pay $500 a year in royalties, and college and local radio stations will be on the hook for $100 a year.\n\"Large radio conglomerates will no longer be able to hide behind truly smaller and public stations to perpetuate this injustice,\" Rep. Jerrold Nadler said at an event in New York to announce the bill.\nRep. Nadler, a New York Democrat, introduced the Fair Play Fair Pay Act along with Reps. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, and Democrats John Conyers and Ted Deutch.\n\"It's a question of basic economic fairness, but it is also a matter of fair competition between music services. No more special privileges for old technologies. No more giveaways,\" said Ted Kalo, executive director of the musicFIRST Coalition in a statement. The coalition is made up of groups that represent artists, managers, and music businesses.\n\"Let the best services win\u2014fair and square, on the depth of their playlists and the quality of their products,\" Kalo said.\nThis post has been updated with further details about the bill and a quote from Rep. Nadler.", "From WikiLeaks' Julian Assange to a larger-than-life billionaire who is rebuilding the Titanic, the Australian election boasts a cast of unlikely candidates who are shaking up the political scene.\nWhen Australians go to the polls on Saturday, a mandatory exercise for all adults, they will have 1,717 candidates from more than 50 parties to choose from.\nThey include the usual sprinkling of former sports stars, far-right fringe groups and everything from the Animal Justice Party to the Smokers' Rights Party and The No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics Party.\nFrom Ecuador's embassy in London, the Australian-born Assange leads a party that hopes to bring \"transparency, accountability and justice\" and potentially become a global movement.\nAssange, who has been living inside the embassy since June 2012 as he fights extradition from Britain to Sweden, has been unable to campaign Down Under but has got into the spirit with a spoof video.\nSporting a blond mullet wig -- short on top but long in the back -- and with Australian rock star John Farnham's 1986 hit \"You're the Voice\" playing, Assange sings of making things \"leak so we can get much bolder\".\nThe WikiLeaks Party, the lyrics say, is \"the light that the world's demanding, make it bright and make things clear\".\nThe 42-year-old, who co-founded the whistleblowing WikiLeaks website which went on to dump hundreds of thousands of US military and diplomatic documents online, says his chance of winning a seat in the upper house Senate was promising.\n\"There's many Australians who support us,\" his father John Shipton, who helped form the party, told AFP at a recent Sydney fundraiser.\n\"The Senate of Australia is one of the world's finest political institutions. It's a house of review and has, despite the two major parties trying to fill it up with cabbage heads from time to time, had an excellent influence on politics generally.\n\"So we wish to extend that influence... and bring accountability and transparency and thus justice to issues.\"\nPlaying on deep dissatisfaction with the major players -- the ruling centre-left Labor Party led by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the conservative opposition Liberal/National coalition headed by Tony Abbott -- new parties have emerged to take their share of the vote.\n\"They are so boring those guys,\" said Clive Palmer, the flamboyant businessman best known for his project to rebuild the ill-fated luxury liner the Titanic. He is standing for a seat in the lower house of parliament.\n\"You've got Kevin Rudd that is more concerned about his hair than the benefit of the Australian people and Tony 'Rabbit' who just doesn't want to talk at all,\" he said, using his nickname for opposition leader Abbott, the election frontrunner.\n\"Everyone knows they're boring and everyone now is searching for a solution. And we've got that solution.\"\nHis fledgling Palmer United Party is standing a candidate in each of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives and teams in the Senate as it spreads its populist message, which includes changing company tax rules.\nAnother renegade is Bob Katter, a 10-gallon-hat-wearing rancher from far north Queensland who has been in parliament for more than a decade as an independent, but who formed his own party in 2011.\n\"I know how to play this game and we will play it with a fair degree of ruthlessness,\" Katter, who champions rural issues, said recently.\nPauline Hanson, founder of the anti-immigration One Nation party who rose to prominence in the 1990s, has also thrown herself back in the ring, saying Australians deserve better than \"selfish, dysfunctional, egotistical political parties\".\nRob Manwaring, a lecturer in politics at Flinders University in South Australia, said there was \"no chance of any significant vote breakthrough\" for WikiLeaks and that the smaller parties would struggle for any influence.\nBut he said: \"In general, the share of the vote for minor parties has been increasing for a number of years... so we are seeing a shift in voting behaviour.\"", "Dean Heller at his Reno office on Wednesday.\nSen. Dean Heller discusses life in the Senates from his Reno office on Wednesday.\nSen. Dean Heller says there is a list of things that keep him awake at night: global issues such as the economy, debt and the nation's lack of a growth strategy, and specifics such as the potential listing of the sage grouse and the spread of Internet gaming.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Nevada Appeal, Heller said the two major parties have differences on issues including unemployment insurance benefits extensions and restoration of cost-of-living raises for veterans, but \"not differences big enough we can't get this thing done.\"\nHe's less confident about big issues such as tax reform and the economy.\n\"There are 10 million jobs that don't exist today that existed 10 years ago,\" he said. \"And we're going to add another trillion to our deficit this year.\"\nHe criticized the program of so-called quantitative easing in which the government is \"buying back our own bonds and basically propping up the stock market.\"\nBut Heller said the core problem is America's lack of a real growth strategy.\n\"The reason we don't have one is because America is not competitive today,\" he said. \"The reason we're not competitive is because we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world.\"\nUntil those issues are dealt with, he said, there's little chance of bringing businesses back from overseas.\nHeller said that if little long-term reform can be managed, Congress must at least renew the tax extenders that allow Nevadans, like those in other states without income taxes, to deduct sales taxes on their IRS returns.\n\"Tax extenders has to happen,\" the Carson City resident said.\nThe potential listing of the sage grouse as an endangered species is another worry, he said.\n\"Harry (Reid) and I are trying to stop that listing,\" Heller said.\nHe said the federal Fish and Wildlife Service must make a decision by September and has been told by a federal judge it has to put aside 20 million acres of habitat for the bird in Nevada.\n\"The question is this: Who do we want to determine that? Someone in the federal government, or should the state of Nevada decide where that habitat is going to be?\"\nHe said Nevadans should make that decision.\nWhere his friend and House colleague Mark Amodei said he was frustrated and doubtful that a deal can be reached on extending unemployment insurance benefits again, Heller said he was more optimistic.\n\"I'm working with Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island),\" he said. \"Philosophically we're far apart, but we both understand the need for that safety net.\"\nHe said he also is pushing hard to restore the Paul Ryan/Patty Murray compromise that reduced cost-of-living adjustments for veterans. The problem is how Democrats wanted to pay the tab, Heller said, basically pushing the cost down the road 10 years. He said Reid, the Senate majority leader, was an honest broker who wanted to get the problem fixed, but that the block was his own party members.\nComprehensive tax reform is a no-go this year, and the Ryan/Murray plan took any substantive changes to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security off the table, Heller said.\nInternet gambling, he said, \"has the potential to really wreak havoc with the economy in the state of Nevada.\"\n\"We have 16 states now considering Internet gambling,\" he said.\nHeller said his biggest fear is that California gets into the market.\nWhen Europe authorized online gaming, he said, there was a 20 percent drop in revenue at bricks-and-mortar casinos, and half of them have since closed.\nAnother issue, he said, is the elimination of the Payments In Lieu Of Taxes program that compensates counties where the vast majority of lands are federally owned and non-taxable. That program primarily benefits Western states such as Nevada, which receives about $22 million a year that makes up a significant portion of budgets in counties as much as 98 percent federally owned.\nThe economic impact on those counties is huge because they simply have nowhere to grow, he said.\n\"I just signed on with Sen. (Mark) Udall (D-Colo.) to fully fund PILT in the future so it doesn't become a pawn in this game,\" Heller said. \"I want a permanent fix. Let's get this thing off the table.\"\nA better solution, he said, would be for the federal government to release a large portion of the 87 percent of Nevada it owns.\n\"We ought to be like states east of the Mississippi, where most of the land is owned by the state.\"\nHeller expressed some frustration that the Yerington lands bill that would allow development of a major copper mine is stalled in the House.\n\"The Senate is not the problem,\" he said. House leadership wants it to be part of an omnibus lands bill wrapping several land deals together, Heller said.\nIf approved, the bill will enable a project that could provide several hundred high-paying mining jobs in economically depressed Lyon County.\n\"It should have been done a year ago,\" he said.\nOver his years in the House and now Senate, Heller has made several immigration-reform proposals that include a structured path for people here illegally to become citizens. He was rebuffed, primarily by his own party. He said he thinks the bill that came out of the Senate last year contains \"an earned citizenship.\"\n\"I think it came close,\" he said.\nHeller said that while he would encourage House leadership to act, \"it's going to be tough to do this year because it's an election year, and election year changes everything.\"", "To take the weight off personalization at scale, pick some moments that are really important.

Sullivan did not offer specifics on the nature of the contact that led to the injury.\nThis is the third time in his NHL career the 24-year-old Murray has been diagnosed with a concussion. He suffered one in practice last February and missed nearly a month. He also suffered a concussion late in the 2015-16 season when he collided with Philadelphia's Brayden Schenn.\nSullivan said the team is focusing on Murray's health and not the number of concussions he has suffered.\n\"It's really hard to make any sort of, to draw any conclusions with this stuff because I think everybody is different,\" Sullivan said. \"That's been my experience in dealing with concussions over the years. The nature of these is different. Sometimes players bounce back extremely quick and others tend to linger and it's hard to predict.\"\nMurray, who won a pair of Stanley Cups with the Penguins in 2016 and 2017, struggled during the opening week of the season. He allowed six goals in an overtime victory over Washington and then let in five in a loss to Montreal. Sullivan was quick to spread around the blame for Pittsburgh's sluggish start, pointing to a group that played sloppy away from the puck.\n\"We've got to be a more difficult team to play against,\" Sullivan said.\nCasey DeSmith will get the first chance at replacing Murray.

Even though director Edgar Wright has been attached to the project since 2007, Ant-Man has been put on the back-burner while Marvel Studios and Wright worked on their other projects.\nWith Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and The Avengers all set with release dates and production starts, fans wonder what comes next. Ant-Man is one of the characters who'll get his own solo flick, we just don't know when. According to Marvel Studios President of Production Kevin Feige, it could be pretty soon.\nAt the Iron Man 2 press event this week, journalists and bloggers had the opportunity to speak with some folks at Marvel and Superhero Hype discussed Edgar Wright and Ant-Man with Feige.\n\"Edgar was in L.A. last week, we sat down, and we started working on a calendar of when to get him back into it once he finishes promoting 'Scott Pilgrim,' so I think towards the end of this year, early next year we'd start looking at early prep for that, but certainly for a release date after 'The Avengers.'\"\nMarvel Studios wants at least two films per year starting next summer with Thor and The First Avenger: Captain America. The summer after currently has The Avengers sitting by itself and my thoughts were that it will be joined by either Iron Man 3 or Ant-Man later that summer. There were two years between the first and second Iron Man installments, so a two-year gap between the release of the third is not unexpected.\nThings are definitely in motion for Ant-Man as we reported last week that The Avengers director Joss Whedon recently met with Edgar Wright, no doubt to talk about Ant-Man's place in The Avengers and the Marvel movie universe.\nEdgar Wright also met with the legendary Stan Lee in February and Lee came away with nothing but praise for that, again re-iterating that Marvel has the Ant-Man movie in the works, along with projects for Black Panther, Iron Fist and others we could see in the future.\nAnt-Man will likely be introduced in The Avengers as I've said a few times over the last two years and that will lead to his spin-off film.

That\u2019s only a 5.7 percent decrease in loan activity, during a time when the country fell into one of its worst recessions ever and most small-business owners I talk to saw sales decline between 10 and 30 percent. It seems to me that most of the small decrease in lending is due to the large decrease in business. Less business means smaller inventories, smaller receivables, and less need for new equipment \u2014 three key reasons small companies borrow money.\nThe Fed chairman went on to say that \u201cjust 40 percent of small businesses attempting to borrow in 2009 had all of their credit needs met.\u201d I\u2019m certainly not in favor of restricting the resources that flow to small businesses, but I really don\u2019t know what to make of this statement. It sounds like something you would hear from a small-business owner who\u2019d just been turned down for a loan \u2014 not from the nation\u2019s top banker. The obvious question, which Mr. Bernanke does not address, is what percentage of small businesses should have \u201call of their credit needs met\u201d?\nThe fact is, many small businesses are not qualified to get a loan. It\u2019s always been that way. Maybe only 40 percent are qualified to have their credit needs met. Does Mr. Bernanke know what the percentage was in 2007? Maybe nothing\u2019s changed. In fairness to Mr. Bernanke, he did say elsewhere in his speech that additional small-business loans should go to \u201ccreditworthy\u201d borrowers. But my concern is that his speech will reinforce two common misconceptions: 1) throwing more debt at small businesses is the way to create jobs and turn around our economy and 2) banks are somehow obligated to meet the \u201cneeds\u201d of all small businesses.\nBanks are not investors. They need to get paid back. We have an S.B.A. loan program that works. Some people complain that it requires too much paperwork. I\u2019ve taken two S.B.A. loans, both many years after I started my business. The amount of paperwork involved was not unreasonable. This is the land of opportunity. Entrepreneurs have an opportunity to borrow money, if they can, or to look for investors. If they can\u2019t find the money that way, they may have to do it the old-fashioned way \u2014 earning it themselves and using their own money.\nI know of lots of creditworthy small businesses that are getting loans. And when I put out a call on this blog to see what experiences others were having, we heard from lots of other people who have been able to get loans \u2014 especially from community banks and credit unions. Of course, it\u2019s worth emphasizing that in most cases these loans are not coming from the big banks. All local markets are different, but my experience in Chicago is that there are many smaller banks that are hungry to make small-business loans. Why? Because there is money to be made from qualified borrowers.\nIn both cases, I had no problem finding another local bank that was happy to get my business. Actually, they were fighting for my business. Here\u2019s a tip for entrepreneurs. Every day, the big banks spend millions of dollars marketing themselves as the bank for small business. This is partially true. They do want small-business accounts. They love the no-interest balances from those accounts. They love the merchant fees collected from charge and debit cards, and they love the service charges. But as for making loans to the same small businesses? In my experience, that\u2019s another story.\nWhile I am sure that there are some loan committees that have become too restrictive, I don\u2019t think it will do anyone any good to create a new loan crisis. The fact is, lending money to a small company does not necessarily create a job. In fact, the loan might buy a machine that eliminates a job. Or it might merely fund losses \u2014 putting off the inevitable and increasing bad debts to suppliers, hurting other businesses.\nIt\u2019s the economy, Mr. Bernanke. Encouraging banks to lend more and small businesses to borrow more isn\u2019t necessarily the answer to our problems. In fact, if I\u2019m not mistaken, aggressive lending had something to do with getting us into this mess.", "BAKU, Azerbaijan, Sporting Alert \u2013 Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has made four modifications to the side that beat West Bromwich on Saturday for today\u2019s Champions League Group C travel to Qarabag.\nTV Channels and Streams: Fox Sports 2 USA, FOX Soccer Match Pass, ESPN3, WatchESPN, FOX Sports GO and fuboTV.

Younger workers have the luxury of taking on more risk, while those nearing retirement age are more conservative. Regardless of your age, there are several common 401k mistakes to avoid.\nThe good news is these mistakes can be avoided with minimal effort.\nSome of the most common mistakes are tax-related errors. The IRS can help with that as it features a wide array of 401k investing tax mistakes and guides on how to fix those errors.\nSay you work for a public company. There\u2019s a good chance that your employer allows staffers to purchase company shares in retirement plans \u2014 maybe even at a discount. Unfortunately, history is littered with examples of employees being too heavily exposed to their employer\u2019s stock only to be burned by negative corporate events. Enron is one of the most glaring examples. More recently, General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) has generated some negative attention regarding employee ownership of its flailing shares.\nThe lesson from Enron, General Electric and others is simple: No matter how long an employee has been at a company or how devoted he or she is to that firm, it is unwise to put too many 401k eggs \u2014 or shares \u2014 in the employer\u2019s basket.\nOne of the most common 401k mistakes is forgetting to rollover the plan when leaving for a new job or not rolling it into an individual retirement account (IRA) when retiring from a company. There are some ways to deal with the rollover process. If you\u2019re changing jobs, simply roll into the new employer\u2019s plan or stay in the old workplace plan, but no new contributions can be made under the latter scenario.\n\u201cIf allowed, this option lets you consolidate your 401(k)s into one account while continuing tax-deferred growth potential. Investment options vary by plan,\u201d according to Fidelity.\nThis is one of the easiest 401k mistakes to fix. Many employer-sponsored retirement plans feature exposure to low-cost index funds. Unfortunately, some don\u2019t. Either way, investors should make every effort to evaluate fund fees on the offerings in their 401k plans because when investing for the long haul, fees really do take on added importance.\nWhile investors are increasingly drawn to low fee funds, including exchange traded funds (ETFs), they are not major parts of the 401k landscape yet. Some studies suggest investors need some prodding when it comes to considering the funds with the lowest fees in respective asset classes.\nA recent study by Morningstar and the University of Chicago presented investors with choices of three S&P 500 ETFs with fees ranging from 0.04% to 0.40%.\n\u201cThe optimal financial choice with these options would naturally be \u2014 no surprise here \u2014 to invest all of one\u2019s money in the cheapest fund. But that did not happen. Instead, only 42% of the funds went to the cheapest option; 31% to the ETF priced in the middle, and 27% to the most expensive ETF,\u201d said Morningstar.\nWhile this is not the most common 401k mistake, some workers with high-risk tolerances may be tempted to treat their 401k plans as trading vehicles. In reality, 401k plans are not built for a trading lifestyle, but some workers tempt fate on this front anyway. The reason this is a big for 401k investing mistake is two-fold.\nFirst, let\u2019s assume your job is not directly tied to financial markets. That increases the likelihood your real job will pull you away from important, market-moving trades, meaning the chances of 401k investing mistakes increases.\nSecond, the more trading an employer does within his or her retirement, the more transaction costs add up, eating away at total returns in the process.\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2018/07/common-401k-mistakes-how-you-can-avoid-them-invtlk/.", "AT&T powers up its blazing new 4G LTE network in Beantown, but does it measure up to Verizon? We jump in the car with a bunch of phones to find out.\nBOSTON\u2014It's still nowhere near the size of Verizon's, but slowly but surely, AT&T is ramping up its 4G LTE network. Today, it flipped the LTE switch on four more cities: Boston, Washington D.C., Baltimore, and Athens, Georgia. That brings AT&T's total number of LTE markets to nine, including Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas Fort-Worth.\nSince I live in northeastern Massachusetts, I hit the road to run some tests in downtown Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline. I also stopped by West Newton, about five miles west of the city border, to see how far it extended. For this test, AT&T sent us two brand new phones: the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket and the HTC Vivid. Both have a nifty little 4G LTE icon that lights up whenever you're in the right coverage area. For comparison purposes, I also brought along a Motorola Atrix 2, which supports AT&T's older HSPA+ 21 protocol, and the HTC Thunderbolt, which works on Verizon's LTE network.\nFirst, let's get the big news out of the way: AT&T's LTE network is fast. With the right conditions, it's as speedy as Verizon's LTE network, or even faster, as we had found in our tests in Houston. I saw speeds in excess of 25 Mbps down, in fact. But it's not terribly consistent yet, at least in direct comparison to Verizon\u2014and not unlike what we found in our nationwide Fastest Mobile Networks test earlier this year.\nFor example, in Cambridge (\"A\" on the map, above left) and downtown Boston (\"B\"), I saw easily repeatable 25 Mbps+ results on Verizon, but AT&T results hovered in the 15 Mbps to 16 Mbps range\u2014which is still extremely fast for a cellular data connection. In Brookline (\"C\"), AT&T took the lead, with results surpassing 25 Mbps, whereas Verizon LTE fell to about 10 Mbps down in my test location. Once I drove out to West Newton (\"D\"), LTE performance degraded on both Verizon and AT&T, at least to the point where it was now equivalent to a fast HSPA+ conncetion (in the 8 Mbps to 10 Mbps range).\nAt first, I had trouble achieving LTE-like speeds with the HTC Vivid, but it turned out AT&T didn't provision its SIM card correctly. I confirmed this by swapping the SIM cards; once I did that, the Vivid hit LTE consistently, and the Skyrocket stopped connecting to it, showing only \"4G\" instead (like other HSPA+ phones on AT&T). Once I learned this, I doubled back and redid my Cambridge results, just to make sure both phones pulled down the same numbers on AT&T 4G LTE (they did).\nThat said, the handset itself has a lot to do with the equation. When you put the Skyrocket next to the Vivid, it's clear the Skyrocket is both thinner and lighter; in fact, it looks just as thin as an original 3G Galaxy S. Considering the new model contains LTE support, it's a pretty amazing feat of engineering\u2014that is, until you try and use it. Unfortunately, Samsung sacrificed reception quality to get the Galaxy S II Skyrocket so thin. Several times during the test, the Skyrocket latched onto 4G LTE, but then failed to deliver data. That's despite waiting over a minute, and after a reboot to double-check. The HTC Vivid, on the other hand, performed much more consistently in the same locations that had given the Skyrocket trouble. This is why we test reception so heavily in each and every one of our reviews, incidentally.\nAnother surprise: the Atrix 2, with its HSPA+ 21 radio, delivered results all over the board, from a low of 2100 Kbps down (roughly equal to HSPA 7.2 on a good day), to a very fast 13 Mbps down (which is squarely in LTE territory, if on the low end).\nI'm glad I had both LTE phones for this test, because if AT&T had just sent me the Skyrocket (and with the good SIM), I would have ended up thinking AT&T's LTE network was spotty and inconsistent. Instead, I can report that while AT&T LTE doesn't extend quite as far as Verizon LTE in Boston, and doesn't always reach the same speeds, it's capable of the same blistering performance with the right conditions. All told, not bad for a launch day.\nIf any of this interests you, AT&T 4G LTE customers can get 200MB for $15 per month, and an additional $15 for another 200MB with DataPlus. AT&T's DataPro plan offers 2GB for $25 per month, plus $10 per gigabyte afterwards. You can also use your phone as a mobile LTE hotspot for $45 per month; that plan comes with 4GB of data.\nIn the meantime, look for full reviews of the Skyrocket and the Vivid soon.\nUpdate 11/09/11: After more testing, we eventually traced the Skyrocket's reception issues to a faulty SIM card (even when provisioned correctly). Samsung sent us a second Skyrocket, which performed similarly to the HTC Vivid on a new round of LTE speed tests.\nFacebook, Fox News Survive Nov. 5, Did You Switch Banks?", "Experts say, the key to ageing gracefully is simple - eat healthy!\nThe key to ageing gracefully is simple - eat healthy. So make changes in your diet instead of going for Botox for wrinkle treatment, say experts. Tanu Arora, Head Of Department - Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics, Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital, and Zodi, senior dietician, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, have a few suggestions. He suggests to include certain foods in diet, which are rich in vitamins like riboflavin, niacin and cyanocobalamin. Plus, excluding poor quality of food, which causes inflammation and ultimately affects skin, is also important.\nMoreover, it is imperative to keep our body hydrated to flush out all the toxins from the body. Dr. Arora suggests to avoid high consumption of sugar and processed carbohydrates as our skin collagen gets damaged; however, intake of foods like fruits and vegetables are good for skin. Deep fried food can add to inflammation. On the other hand, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low fat dairy and lean protein can help fight inflammation. Lettuce, broccoli, spinach, tomato, watermelon, grapefruit, guava, salmon, chickpea, oatmeal and brown rice help in curbing inflammation. A long way to preventing wrinkles is to eat food items like carrots that are loaded with vitamins.\nAdding almonds and walnuts to our diet will help increase Vitamin E, which is known to help fight skin problems. In addition, green tea has powerful antioxidants that protect our skin from damage. Consuming yogurt is also quite beneficial as it has probiotics that nourish skin from inside and outside.\nDr. Arora also recommends to add honey to our daily diet as it is hygroscopic in nature, plus all berries are healthy antioxidants. They kill radicals that are in bodies, damaging DNA and cells and causing premature ageing. Berries can fight damages caused by environmental pollutants and toxins. Similarly, turmeric acts as antioxidants. You may add it in your milk or food. He also insists on avoiding alcohol as it creates free radicals, which damage cells and accelerates ageing.\nThe most powerful anti-ageing tool is antioxidants. The pigments that give food and vegetable their colour are potent antioxidants. Including deep green vegetables like spinach, mustard and fenugreek tin our diet is important. They are packed with polyphenols and chlorophyll. Carotenoids and flavonoids found in most fruits and vegetables help build cell membranes and protect collagen. Always opt for bright red tomatoes, carrots, purple cabbage, beetroot, yellow orange-red capsicum, sweet potatoes and broccoli.\nTo optimise phytonutrient content of foods, it is important to fuel yourself with seasonal fruits and vegetables. Opt for organic produce, avoid peeling your fruits as some phytonutrients are concentrated in the skin. Steam or lightly cook to preserve water soluble nutrients.\nOur body can make all the fats it needs except for two essential fatty acids: Linoleic Acid (LA) and Alpha Linolenic Acid (ALA). These two are like the team leaders to build strong cell walls for beautiful and well-nourished skin. They are also known to maintain cellular hydration, reduce inflammation and balance blood sugar control. Include flax seed oil in your diet, which comprises all the essential fatty acids for a beautiful complexion and great health.\nOther EFA rich foods are coconut, avocado, walnut, almonds, mustard seeds, pumpkin seed oil and oily coldwater fish. Always remember, EFAs will not make you fat; in fact, they breakdown and eliminate cholesterol and bad fats from your body. EFAs are wonderful wrinkle softeners and moisturise the skin from within.\nDid you know that 98% of our hair, skin and nails are proteins?! Therefore, ample amount of protein would wade off the visible signs of ageing, while protein deficiency can result in premature ageing and even droopy facial muscles. It is advised to include beans and legumes, organic eggs, chicken and fish in your diet, which play havoc on your hormones.", "Susie Wolff is used to making history.\nA former DTM racer, the Scot was a test and development driver for the Williams Formula One team between 2013 and 2015.\nShe became the first female driver in 22 years to take part in a grand prix meeting when she drove in a practice session ahead of the 2014 British Grand Prix, something she did again at that year's race in Germany and in the following season in Spain and Silverstone.\nNow, Wolff has trod new ground again by becoming the first female team principal in the short history of Formula E -- the world's premier all-electric racing series.\nShe now leads the Monaco-based Venturi team and was on the grid for the recent season finale in New York.\nAfter retiring from competitive driving in 2015, Wolff founded the Dare to be Different initiative with the aim of getting more women involved in motorsport.\n\"It's a two-step problem,\" she tells CNN's Supercharged when asked about the number of women participating in motorsport.\n\"The first is that there's not enough role models that are visible to inspire the next generation, and that leads to the second problem that we simply don't have enough women entering the sport.\n\"To be successful in this sport you need to be talented -- your gender is actually irrelevant.\"\nWolff isn't overly concerned about the groundbreaking nature of her new role. But she does take satisfaction in the thought it could encourage young women to get involved in the industry.\n\"I thought the whole gender issue was over when I stopped racing,\"explains Wolff, who is married to Mercedes F1's CEO and team principal Toto Wolff.\n\"But I can also see that it's causing quite a lot of interest with me becoming a team principal. If that's inspiring to other women, if that's showing what's possible, then I think that's a great byproduct of what I'm doing -- but it's most certainly not my absolute aim.\"\nWolff is a racer -- one who wants to be judged on her results rather than her gender.\nWith her appointment at Venturi, Wolff occupies a high-profile role within a sport that will be under increased scrutiny as it attempts a leap forward -- in terms of technology and design -- with its radical new car.\nVenturi is also something of an FE enigma. Co-founded by Leonardo DiCaprio, it has taken just three FE podiums and is yet to win a race. Stephane Sarrazi did cross the line first at the end of the second London E-Prix race in 2015 but was penalized for exceeding his energy limit.\nLast season, Venturi finished seventh in the team standings, despite moments of promise from its drivers.\nEdoardo Mortara looked set to win in Hong Kong before a spin meant he finished second. From there, the team showed flashes of speed -- Maro Engel was fourth in Paris, a result Tom Dillmann matched in the first New York race -- but lacked consistency.\nImproving Venturi's results is Wolff's primary challenge.\n\"We're a team not performing as well as we should,\" she admits. \"We all have the wish to improve our performance, we have some great people.\"\nAfter a winless first four seasons, Venturi is aiming upwards. It has recently been executing an expansion plan, which included launching a young electric driver academy and signing ex-F1 racer Felipe Massa for season five.\nVenturi CEO and founder Gildo Pastor explained that hiring Wolff -- who's original contact with Venturi came while she was still racing and led to discussions about an FE drive -- marked the start of the next phase of the team's development.\nWolff has been reunited with her former Williams teammate Massa, who raced for the team between 2014 and 2017.\n\"He can bring a lot to the team,\" says Wolff. \"I'm a great believer of creating a culture and energy in a team that allows everyone to flourish and he's someone that I definitely believe can bring that to Venturi.\"\nBut Wolff doesn't believe the prospect of more F1 drivers following Massa into the FE paddock is a vital step for the now-established series.\n\"I don't think you need F1 drivers in Formula E,\" she insists. \"I have a lot of respect for a lot of great drivers in the paddock already and I think they have rightly found their way in Formula E.\n\"It's turning into a championship with so much potential.\"\nIndeed, FE needs to create its own stars. Drivers such as Felix Rosenqvist and Mitch Evans have shone brightly since joining the series, while, away from the driving, Sam Bird's race engineer at Virgin Racing is leaving to take up a new role with Red Bull's F1 team.\nVenturi's past form means the pressure is immediately on Wolff.\nBut if she achieves what she wants, she could become an FE superstar.", "San Diego State redshirt-junior forward Matt Shrigley couldn\u2019t buy a basket in his first six games since coming off an ACL tear in the offseason, missing his first 14 shots, 13 of them behind the arc.\nBut Saturday night against Air Force Academy, he took the monkey squarely off his back with 12 points to help lead the SDSU men\u2019s basketball team to a 70-61 win.\n\u201cHe needs to see the ball go through the net in a game, and hopefully that\u2019ll happen before I retire,\u201d head coach Steve Fisher jokingly said Friday of Shrigley.\nWell, Fisher got his wish, and then some, as Shrigley drained the first four shots he took, all 3-pointers, in a span of less than three minutes midway through the first half.\n\u201cHe made some timely ones early and I think that helped other guys make 3\u2019s,\u201d Fisher said.\nThat would be the extent of his point production, although he was still the team\u2019s third-highest scorer.\nBarring Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry, most 3-point shooters are streaky in nature, but even Shrigley said he\u2019s never been in a slump like the one he was in to begin this season, at least at SDSU.\nSeeing the first one go in was just something he had to just see to believe, because as he said after the game, he thought his 14 previous shots were all going in.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have this weight on my shoulders coming back but it\u2019s definitely nice to knock a few down,\u201d Shrigley said.\nAs Fisher predicted in prior press conferences, the crowd gave Shrigley a standing ovation after he made his first one, and then began chanting his name after the fourth.\n\u201cOur fans did a wonderful job expressing their appreciation for what he did,\u201d Fisher said.\nAlso in the boat of looking to right some early-season wrongs was sophomore forward Malik Pope, who had a team-high eight rebounds and also added 13 points on 3-of-5 shooting from from beyond the arc.\nBesides the feel-good story, without Shrigley\u2019s contribution the Aztecs may have been saddled with consecutive losses, something about as rare as seeing the Loch Ness Monster around the Mesa.\nThe team was without leading scorer, freshman point guard Jeremy Hemsley, who sat out the entire game with a bone bruise on his right foot.\nHesmley\u2019s foot was stepped on during the Fresno State game and Fisher said he was \u201cshocked\u201d when Hemsley told him he didn\u2019t think he could start, but may have been available in an emergency situation.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t get tempted to try and put him in,\u201d Fisher said.\nShrigley also led the team with six assists, his first six of the season, something that Fisher said was equally, or more, important than his 12 points.\nWhile the team\u2019s 30.8-percent mark from behind the 3-point line was nothing to write home about, the Aztecs made a huge improvement on what Fisher said was the biggest reason for the loss at Fresno State: turnovers.\nThe team had 13 less turnovers than its streak-breaking loss against the Bulldogs.\n\u201cThey knew it, they knew (turnovers) cost us last game,\u201d Fisher said.\nWithout a starter over 6-foot-7, Air Force employed a compact 3-2 zone to get as many bodies inside the paint as possible.\nThis made the 3-point line vacant territory on many occasions, but the Aztecs were not able to capitalize most of their possessions, outside of Pope and Shrigley and sophomore guard Trey Kell toward the end of the game.\n\u201cThey dared us, then double-dared us to shoot the ball from the perimeter,\u201d Fisher said.\nFisher said he \u201chopes\u201d teams zone the Aztecs down the stretch, but also thought that 39 3-point attempts was more than he\u2019d like.\nWith the height advantage, though, the Aztecs dominated the offensive glass, which has been an issue in many of the team\u2019s games this year, with 13 offensive boards compared to three for the Falcons.\nThat led to a 12-2 advantage on second-chance points as well.\nThe Aztecs will now get a week\u2019s rest as their next matchup will come 1 p.m. next Sunday at San Jose State University.", "President Buhari, Wednesday, has received

The sequel has had plenty of ups and downs over the years with Michael Bay leaving the project in the hands of director Joe Carnahan, who ended up leaving even after writing the script. Now the project finally seems to have firm footing with directors Adil Arbi and Bilall Fallah as the latest filmmakers getting behind the camera, and we finally have word on what kind of problem Will Smith and Martin Lawrence will be dealing with this time.\nProduction Weekly (via Heroic Hollywood), released the Bad Boys for Life plot synopsis, which reveals the Miami police department has a new elite team called AMMO that has been tasked with taking down a drug cartel leader named Armando Armas (Jacob Scipio). The druglord villain is described as \u201ca cold-blooded killer with a vicious, taunting nature,\u201d and for some reason, his seemingly equally as ruthless mother has tasked him with killing Mike Lowery (Will Smith).\nThat takes care of the action side of things, but there\u2019s also an interesting comedic and romantic twist in the sequel with actress Paola Nu\u00f1ez playing Rite, a tough and funny criminal psychologist who has been named the head of the new AMMO team. Coincidentally enough, Rite just so happens to be Mike\u2019s ex-girlfriend, the one who got away. Surely that will create some tension between Rite and Mike, especially if he and his partner Marcus (Martin Lawrence) are put on the team.\nAs for the rest of the cast, we know Joe Pantoliano will be reprising his role as angry Captain Howard, and Alexander Ludwig, Vanessa Hudgens and Charles Melton are also getting in on the sequel this time.\nFor all the failed attempts to get Bad Boys for Life off the ground, this actually looks like it\u2019s going to happen. Our own sources tell us that the sequel is doing camera tests in Atlanta next week, so production should be starting very soon with the script from Joe Carnahan, Peter Craig and Chris Bremmer. As for whether directors Arbi and Fallah will be able to bring the same kind of action and excitement that Michael Bay deliver before, we\u2019ll find out in a little over a year.\nBad Boys for Life will be hitting theaters next year on January 17, 2020.", "Safety first: The Department of Transportation is suggesting refuge islands, mid-block signals, and new traffic patterns along Ralph Avenue in Flatlands to improve public safety.\nFury road: The city plans major changes for a six-block stretch of Ralph Avenue where 34 pedstrians were injured \u2014 one fatally \u2014 in 2012\u20132016.\nLocals are hopeful these street-safety improvements will \u201cYield\u201d results.\nThe city plans to add pedestrian islands, mid-block signals, curb extensions, and more improvements to a deadly stretch of Ralph Avenue in Flatlands where drivers failing to yield to pedestrians and left turns have been the major cause of crashes.\n\u201cNot yielding is a particular problem at this corridor,\u201d said an official from the Department of Transportation who presented the plan to Community Board 18 at its April 18 meeting.\nThe stretch of Ralph Avenue from avenues J to T is a Vision Zero \u201cPriority Corridor,\u201d singled out for special attention by the mayor\u2019s office due to the high number of severe accidents there.\nFrom 2012 to 2016, one person was killed and nine were seriously injured in traffic incidents along that corridor, according to city stats.

Over the past three years, the American people have learned even more about how this law affects their jobs, their paychecks and their care.\nThe president has a responsibility to address honestly the concerns surrounding this law. I hope he\u2019ll do that Friday.\nFirst, President Obama should admit that millions of hardworking Americans will see their premiums continue to rise.\nThe health care law is a maze of new mandates, regulations, and tax increases. Those tax increases, on everything from medical devices to health insurance plans, will be passed on to consumers. Every item the law requires insurers to provide will add to the cost.\nFor example, it doesn\u2019t make sense for a woman to have to pay for an insurance policy that provides screening exams for prostate cancer.\nHow much will premiums go up? At first glance, it looked as if the increases in the Covered California exchange might not be so bad. Then Avik Roy, a health care scholar at the Manhattan Institute, realized the state was comparing apples and oranges. A more precise comparison showed that many Californians could see their rates double.\nFor a typical 40-year old man who doesn\u2019t smoke, premiums in the exchange could increase by 116 percent. In Santa Clara County, his rates could go up 126 percent.\nSome Californians will get help paying those increased rates, but a lot of people will have to cover the extra cost on their own. That\u2019s a far cry from President Obama\u2019s promise that the average family would see their premiums go down by $2,500 a year.\nSecond, the president should admit that paying for his health care law is balanced on the backs of young Americans. Under the law, young healthy people have to pay more, so that older, sicker people can pay less. They have to buy high-priced, government-mandated insurance they may not need, or want, or that\u2019s not right for them. If they don\u2019t, the whole scheme will collapse under its own weight.\nAt the same time, many businesses are hesitant to add new workers or are shifting to more part-time employees. It\u2019s because the law says companies with more than 50 full-time employees have to provide expensive one-size-fits-all health insurance. That means many of these same young people are having a tough time finding a good job.\nEven the city of Long Beach is limiting most of its 1,600 part-time employees to less than 27 hours a week, on average.\nThe city says that if it doesn\u2019t cut back hours, the new health benefits would cost up to $2 million more next year. They also say the extra expense could trigger layoffs and cutbacks in city services. This means reduced take home pay for workers who see their hours cut.\nBetween higher premiums and smaller paychecks, young people will be paying more than their fair share. In return, all they\u2019re getting is a chance to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until they\u2019re 26. When they turn 27, the law\u2019s higher premiums will hit them hard.\nThird, the president should correct the record on his promise that if you like your insurance, you can keep it. Millions of Americans will soon learn that the health care law actually takes away the plan they have now.\nA University of Chicago study found that most individual insurance plans now on the market will not be allowed to exist because they don\u2019t meet the law\u2019s many requirements.

Kim encouraged participants to fully engage in the weekend and keep an open mind in order to receive the benefits of using the business model canvas to stimulate, create, and iterate.\n\u201cFollowing Kim\u2019s inspiring speech, people were invited to pitch an idea. Of the 42 registered participants 22 pitched, including 10 year-old Zaire Lodge who was part of a father-son team. Whilst Zaire\u2019s idea to create \u201cReaderz\u201d, an App that would allow young people to receive payment for reading to Seniors, wasn\u2019t selected, nine other ideas that ranged from a local health & wellness retreat to a motorized bike taxi were peer-selected to proceed through to Startup Weekend. Once selections were made, remaining attendees had to determine which idea they wanted to support and as a result teams were formed. Over the next two days teams worked together to build on and rearrange ideas until they came up with a MVP.\n\u201cUnder the stern but passionate facilitation of Ethan Bagley of Startup Global, teams immediately began working with most staying until 11pm on the Friday evening. The work began again the following Saturday [Mar 7] at 8:30am with breakfast, lunch and dinner being served by local entrepreneur, Anthony Belvedere of Peppinos, to keep teams fed and motivated.

On the one hand, you get to be involved in the building process, working together with your builder to create a home specifically tailored to your preferences. On the other hand, more involvement also means more responsibility. You play a critical role in making sure that your home build goes smoothly.\nThe good news is that your builder will be there for you every step of the way to support you and keep you on track. With their help, there\u2019s no need to be overwhelmed. Designing your own home can be challenging, but with a few tips you can be on your way to living in your dream home.\n1. Research your builder and ask for recommendations. Choosing a trustworthy company is the most critical step to a successful building process. Before selecting a builder, take the time to do your research and examine your possibilities. Look for someone who has experience building the type of home you\u2019re looking for with some of the special accommodations that you need. Once you narrow down your search, speak directly to previous customers to find out what they have to say about your contenders. Was their experience positive? Did the builder complete their home on time? Was the builder approachable and communicative? High customer satisfaction from previous customers is often the best indicator of future success.\n2. Get to know your builder\u2019s construction manager. A good builder should make sure that your home\u2019s construction manager is on site and available to answer questions. Introduce yourself early and let them know the level of involvement and awareness you\u2019d like to have throughout the process. If you\u2019d like to know more about the products being used, your builder can help. He or she should also be available to update you on your home\u2019s progress, and to conduct a walk-through of your home to see how the building process is coming along.\n3. Come prepared with a wish list. Customization is one of the biggest benefits of building a home instead of buying an existing home off the market. Take full advantage of the ability to customize your home by preparing a wish list of what you\u2019d like to see in your forever home.\nFor example, Paula May, a homeowner living in the Gardens at Fieldstone community in the town of Greece, knew that she wanted to live in a homeowners\u2019 association and that she didn\u2019t want to be responsible for any outdoor maintenance. She came to Wegman Companies Inc. with these preferences and others in mind.\n\u201cTogether, we designed our bathrooms and kitchen, chose flooring, cabinetry and countertops, to create our dream home. This was our third home that we\u2019ve built and WCI made it by far the easiest and best experience,\u201d May said.\nWhether it\u2019s a gas fireplace, built-in shelving, or electrical outlets on the mantle, your requests for options and upgrades can be general or specific. Don\u2019t be shy, either \u2014 now is the time! It can\u2019t hurt to ask for something you want, even if you\u2019re not sure it\u2019s possible. In any case, a good builder will work with you to either fulfill your requests or come up with reasonable alternatives. The more you know about your needs and desires, the more time you can save during the planning process.\n4. Do your part to keep the process on schedule. Most customers are incredibly eager to keep their projects on schedule. While not everything about the building timeline will be in your control \u2014 or in your builder\u2019s control, for that matter \u2014 there are some things you can do in order to help speed the process along. First, do your best to make appointments with contractors in a timely manner. Then, after you meet with them, make your selections even before they are due to the builder. Making your choices even a day early will give your builder more time to work on your house, just as making them late will delay the process.\n5. Try not to get caught up in the minutiae. There\u2019s an idea that since you have the opportunity to customize your house, everything should be absolutely perfect, even the smallest details. That can be liberating, but also stifling. With unlimited options, something as simple as choosing a paint color can seem to be overwhelming; you can easily find yourself spending hours or even days deliberating between shades of grey. While you certainly should take each decision seriously, try not to put too much pressure on yourself. The process should be enjoyable, not a series of chores. Get the big decisions right, but cut yourself some slack on the small ones.\nTo begin building your dream home or home addition, visit Wegman Companies.", "An unsolicited offer from Hilltop Holdings (HTH) sent SWS Group (SWS) soaring on Friday.\nNEW YORK (TheStreet) -- An unsolicited offer from Hilltop Holdings (HTH - Get Report) sent SWS Group (SWS soaring on Friday. By market close, Hilltop added 8.4% to $25.41, while SWS popped 20.1% to $7.28.\nSWS Group, a Dallas-based financial services company, confirmed it had received an unsolicited acquisition proposal from Hilltop for all outstanding common stock for $7 a share. The transaction will be comprised of 50% cash and 50% Hilltop common stock. The offer puts shares at a 15.5% premium to Thursday's close of $6.06 a share. Hilltop Holdings currently owns 24% of SWS' common stock.\n\"We believe that Hilltop's and SWS's businesses are highly complementary, and that the proposed transaction is a compelling opportunity for SWS's stockholders,\" said Hilltop chairman Gerald J. Ford in a statement. \"The transaction represents a premium to market for SWS stockholders, while also enabling stockholders to participate in the continued growth of the combined enterprise. In addition, we believe it will create benefits from being part of a larger organization that is strongly capitalized and positioned to compete on an expanded scale.\"\n\"We rate SWS GROUP INC (SWS) a SELL. This is driven by a number of negative factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its disappointing return on equity, poor profit margins and weak operating cash flow.\"\nCurrent return on equity is lower than its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of weakness within the company. Compared to other companies in the Capital Markets industry and the overall market, SWS GROUP INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.\nThe gross profit margin for SWS GROUP INC is currently extremely low, coming in at 13.07%. It has decreased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 0.40% significantly trails the industry average.\nNet operating cash flow has significantly decreased to -$80.16 million or 50.84% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing to the industry average, the firm's growth rate is much lower.\nRegardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 8.8%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 7.4%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share.\n\"We rate HILLTOP HOLDINGS INC (HTH) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, compelling growth in net income, good cash flow from operations, impressive record of earnings per share growth and solid stock price performance. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows low profit margins.\"\nHTH's very impressive revenue growth greatly exceeded the industry average of 9.0%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues leaped by 555.6%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.\nThe net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Insurance industry. The net income increased by 914.3% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from -$4.05 million to $32.96 million.\nNet operating cash flow has significantly increased by 3898.28% to $448.01 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, HILLTOP HOLDINGS INC has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -23.48%.\nHILLTOP HOLDINGS INC reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. Stable earnings per share over the past year indicate the company has sound management over its earnings and share float. We anticipate these figures will begin to experience more growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, HILLTOP HOLDINGS INC's EPS of -$0.12 remained unchanged from the prior years' EPS of -$0.12. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.36 versus -$0.12).\nPowered by its strong earnings growth of 614.28% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 60.59% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Looking ahead, the stock's sharp rise over the last year has already helped drive it to a level which is relatively expensive compared to the rest of its industry. We feel, however, that other strengths this company displays justify these higher price levels.", "Thirty-four-year-old Staff Sgt. Matthew A. Pucino, 34, of Cockeysville died Monday in Pashay Kala, Afghanistan, when his mounted patrol unit was attacked with an improvised explosive device, the Pentagon said. Sergeant Pucino was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group of the Maryland Army National Guard in Glen Arm. He is the 11th Maryland Army National Guardsman to die in the war on terror. Sergeant Pucino was deployed to Afghanistan in July 2009. He had also served in Iraq. A native of Boston, he enlisted in the Army in 2002. Survivors include his wife, Crystal Pucino, of Clarksville, Tenn.; parents Albert and Kathryn Pucino of Orlando, Fla.; and a sister, Lisa Haglof of Sagamore, Mass.\nBaltimore County Executive James T. Smith Jr. said he will not approve pay raises for his successor or for County Council members, despite recommendations by an advisory board that he do so. \"I do not believe this is the time to raise the salary of elected officials,\" Smith said in a news release Tuesday. \"We are in the midst of a difficult economy and individuals and families are working hard to make ends meet.\" The advisory panel had recommended that the county executive's salary be raised 8 percent and the council members' salaries 2 percent. His decision, which has the support of Council Chairman Joseph Bartenfelder, means officials' salaries will remain unchanged for eight years. The last raise was in 2006. The council must enact pay increases for those who serve in the next term, which begins in December 2010. The annual salary for council members will remain at $54,000, with an additional $6,000 for the chairman. The executive is paid $150,000 a year. \"The advisory board is mandated by state law to make recommendations every four years,\" said Don Mohler, county spokesman. \"The board justified its recommendations.

The boater returned a few hours later and found an empty kayak and life jacket.

My lovely wife Dani.\nI must admit, it's been tough getting back into the swing of things after my honeymoon in the Cayman Islands last week.\nHere, I'm just a sportswriter. There, I was an international sports star.\nIf you want to relax like a king, I highly recommend Grand Cayman. If you're into recreationally competitive running - as Dani and I are - and want to clean house, it's the place to go, too.\nWe discovered that on the last morning of our trip.\nEvery day last week in the Caymanian Compass, one of the country's two newspapers, there was a quarter-page ad for a two-mile road race on Saturday. Friday's edition even had a preview of the race as one of its leading stories in the sports section. It had all the makings of a major sporting event on the island - something for me to maybe write about when I returned.\nWhile we certainly had no intentions of \"racing\" during our honeymoon, it was only two miles and we did have our running shoes. We'd just treat it as a \"fun run.\" The opportunity to pick up a race T-shirt from a foreign land just couldn't be dismissed.\nAnd it became fairly apparent to us as we registered before the race that we were the only foreigners in the field. We were the only ones who paid the entry fee in non-island currency. And why would any normal tourists want to disrupt their vacation with something like this anyway?\nIt's stinking hot there, even in early October. The summer months are even worse. It's a seemingly impossible place for someone to become much of a runner. (Last year's Cayman Islands Marathon had only 17 finishers).\nStill, I never expected to be holding down about 25th place 600 yards into the race. Though already sweating profusely, I wasn't out of my comfort zone.\nThen, even more surprisingly, they just started dropping like flies in front of me. It was like a gym-class run. By the time I hit the half-way mark in 5:55 - only a blazing mile time in gym class - I was sixth, and full of smiles for all the photographers and cameramen.\nSo, to end the suspense, I didn't win. I finished fourth, while Dani was the award-winning third female.\nAll in all, it made for a nice flight home that evening. While we weren't flocked by reporters when we landed at BWI, we did get a surprise phone call from the race director the next day.\nHe thanked us for competing and told us he'd send us the story from the paper, which he was probably also writing because he was filled with questions.\nDon't worry, though, I won't let it go to my head. The small box of Habanos I smuggled back will take care of that.", "I can\u2019t believe anyone really expected Samuel Eto\u2019o would sign for an Uzbekistan soccer club. In fact I wager nobody \u2014 myself included \u2014 could even name a Uzbekistan club. This one is called Kurvchi and Eto\u2019o did actually travel there for talks. He left saying he was going back to Barcelona to train and play and he would consider his options in the coming weeks. I am certain such a soccer backwater is not where Eto\u2019o intends to float his boat. If he does, he has lost his appetite for the top level of the game.\nAnyone remember a plan by Brazilians to put an end to the creeping defensive wall. You know, when the referee pulls the wall back the required 10 yards from where a free kick will be taken and then turns a blind eye as that wall creeps forward and forward as the kick is taken. That was when referees were supplied with spray paint to mark where the line must be drawn. As an idea if faded. Well, it has been revived in Argentina, which is trying the tactic.\nI am happy to say Chelsea have given a free transfer to it faithful servant Claude Makelele, the Chelsea fan favourite who has spent years running a tight ship in from of the back four. This is a man who reads the game as well as anyone in the game; the man who tackles like a demon; the man who sets attacking moves in motion. He has been doing for years at Chelsea and is about to start doing it at Paris St. Germain. He wanted to go home and Chelsea helped make it possible. You see, even the biggest clubs have big hearts some of the time.\nIt\u2019s often premature to talk of transfers during the frenzied musical chairs that go on each summer across Europe. But one does fascinate me. Sunderland\u2019s Roy Keane wants to pull of a four-man raid on Tottenham that would transform the shape of his club. He\u2019s ready to part with $46 million to sign up Pascal Chimbonda, Younes Kaboul, Teemu Tainio and Steed Malbranque. Chimbonda is already talking about how impressed he was in his chat with Keane so we can expect him to show up in the North East. Landing all four could be the coup of the transfer season.", "Since May, New York magazine has launched an irregular series of \u201cpop-up blogs\u201d to expand its coverage on a variety of topics including relationships, the arts and travel.\nThe blogs focus on a specific theme \u2014 exploring Paris, untangling love lives or navigating New York\u2019s art scene, said Ben Williams, digital editor of New York Media (which owns New York and its associated properties). They run for a month, and they have bolstered the magazine\u2019s traffic and its bottom line, he said.\nEach \u201cpop-up\u201d is basically a Web version of a traditional magazine insert, Williams said. The editorial team comes up with a series of topics they think would be a good fit for New York, and the advertising staff tries to sell those concepts to advertisers. If the sales team finds a sponsor, the editorial side creates the blog and fleshes out plans for coverage.\n\u201cAdvertisers like them because they\u2019re kind of a TV miniseries, so you have a beginning, middle and end,\u201d Williams said.\nAlthough the blogs are targeted to specific advertisers, they do not contain native advertising, Williams said. Beyond approving the initial concept, the sponsors don\u2019t have any control over the editorial content.\nWilliams said readers have responded positively to the blogs. Two blogs finished their run with a combined 1.4 million unique views, and had individual stories (including this Rachel Corbett post about art selfies) that have gotten more than 100,000 views.\nHe declined to say exactly how much revenue the blogs bring in but said they\u2019re a \u201cbonus\u201d rather than a fundamental part of New York\u2019s business model.\nThe biggest challenge to creating the blogs, Williams said, is \u201cstaffing up\u201d once an advertiser has agreed to bankroll the content. He said the magazine takes a portion of the revenue from each blog and invests in finding writers who fit each topic. So far, contributors have included Jen Doll, Tim Murphy and Thessaly La Force.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good challenge because these are things we actually want to do,\u201d Williams said.", "Steps Being Taken to Facilitate NK Power Shift.

O Kuk Ryol are considered leading candidates for vice chairman, while several other elite bureaucrats from the Workers\u0092 Party and the Cabinet will also vie. In this case, Jang Song Taek, the party\u0092s director for administration and Kim\u0092s confidant and brother-in-law, could also be named a vice chairman.\nKorean and Japanese media also reported that Kim Jong Un has been designated successor, and news has spread to the Workers\u0092 Party and the military accordingly. No official confirmation on this has yet to come, however.\n\u0093Since North Korean leader Kim has always been accompanied by Jong Un whenever inspecting military units since late last year, military insiders have speculated who his successor is,\u0094 the source said.\nSources on North Korean affairs said the commission is also relocating to Government Building 3 in Pyongyang, which is packed with key organizations of the Workers\u0092 Party. Commission departments have moved into the building while those of the party left early to late last month. Jong Un neither is a member of the North Korean parliament nor holds a known official title, but his office will reportedly be set up at the commission in the building.\nLicense plate numbers with \u0093Pyongyang 03\u0094 are reserved for vehicles for officials named to posts at the \u0093standing\u0094 National Defense Commission, according to sources.", "Airgas in Woodland is the place to get helium. We have 2 tanks. Take an empty one and exchange it there for a new one.\nSometimes there may be helium shortages, so call ahead to make sure they have it on hand.\nBefore leaving campus, be sure that you have all supplies needed by using the blimp field check list, located in the folder Y:\\Projects\\Wood\\Wood_Documents\\Field List. Check that you have all items on the list and you are ready to go.\nItems loaded in the truck bed are the helium tanks, blimp, car battery, wooden tiles, and linoleum tiles.\nFirst load in the helium tanks and secure them to the truck with the clamp straps. Use one strap around the bottom of the two tanks to secure them together. Use a second strap to secure the two tanks to the truck, using the hook on the truck rack at the truck cab to help hold the strap in place during transport. Use a third strap to secure the tanks to the truck at the neck of the tank safety caps.\nPlace the 12 volt battery between the wheel well and the inside helium tank, against the side of the truck bed.\nNow load the blimp and tarp diagonally across the truck bed. Place the wood tiles equally across the tarp then spread the linoleum tiles evenly across the tops of the wood tiles to hold everything in place. The driver should watch for tarp blowing up from the truck bed \u2013 and stop to rearrange the tiles as soon as this occurs. With all tiles evenly spread, this should not happen, but you should check the arrangement from time to time.\nAll other equipment goes into the truck cab.\nOnce at the site, set up tiles and GPS their coordinates before doing anything with the blimp. The more tiles you lay out, the more tiles you will get in a photo closer to the ground and the better the ability to accurately stitch together the photos. Make a crude map of tile numbers and locations so that you can match up pictures and tiles for analysis.\nFirst, prepare the helium tank using plumbers tape on the connector and tightening the pressure regulator onto the helium tank. Open the tank valve and check for leaks. I found that there was a small leak even with plumbers tape, but not too bad (could be the individual tank).\nAttach the clear plastic hose to the helium tank hose barb. When putting away equipment, be sure this item is on top of the pressure regulator rather than underneath it, to prevent damage to the hose.\nMove the tarp and blimp to the top of the truck cab. Determine the blimp\u2019s direction \u2013 the input valve has to be adjacent to the tank so that the plastic hose remains attached to the blimp during the fill procedure. Be sure the two release valves on the opposite side of the blimp are closed before starting to fill the blimp.\nAt this point, attach the blimp to the truck with a green clamp strap. Use the white blimp loop located near the junction of the stays for this attachment. It is very important that the blimp is attached to you or to a solid object at all times!\nNow attach the black-taped end of the hose to the blimp, and turn the smallest knob on the pressure regulator to begin filling. If the helium is noisy at the input valve, simply open the small knob some more. The large knob can also be manipulated. I believe it regulates how fast the helium from the tank can flow through the pressure regulator.\nIt does not take long to fill the blimp, about 5-10 minutes. There is a string that is attached at the top and bottom of the blimp that assists in navigation. While filling, position this string so that as the blimp tightens, the string on the fill side is positioned close to the input valve and the string on the far side is positioned between the two release valves.\nToward the end of the fill, it is possible that the pressure inside the blimp will pop the plastic hose off of the input valve, so you may want to hold the valve/hose connection at this point. Note: the whole valve pulled out of the blimp during one deployment as I was pulling the plastic hose off of the valve. The valve is now inserted further into its opening and seems to be doing fine. The position of the valve no longer permits the valve cover to attach to it. This does not seem to be a problem either in flight or in storage.\nThe amount of helium used to fill the blimp is ~ 900-1000 psi. An entire helium tank holds ~1800 psi, so you can get 2 fills per tank.\nThe blimp is full when the strings are tight and the multiple creases at the seam are smallish. Remember that the goal is not how much helium can we get in the blimp; all we want is enough loft so that the blimp is capable of lifting the camera.\nDuring the fill time, you should be straightening out the blimp\u2019s stays, positioning the blimp strings, tying the ribbons to the stays (do not make knots!), and generally making sure that the blimp\u2019s mechanics look functional.\nOnce the blimp is full, tie the kite string to the blimp feeder string. We\u2019ve attached the string to the blimp with knots, then have duck-taped the entire connection for safety.\nBefore moving the blimp, be sure to attach it to your body in some way! The blue clamp strap works well cinched onto the kite winder handle then knotted onto a belt loop.\nNow get the camera ready.\nThe settings should be flash on, manual, continuous, and ISO400. Be sure the battery is fully charged and that the memory card is empty. Make sure that the maximum resolution is being used. For a 16 GB card, that should yield ~2400 potential pictures. If the camera says there are 9999 pictures remaining, it tells you the resolution is too low.\nAttach the camera to the blimp once the settings are confirmed.\nThe last thing before launching the blimp is to set up the open shutter on the camera. Saving this for the final step will save you a bunch of pictures.\nUse the device sent with the blimp for holding down the shutter. Use two rubber bands to secure it to the camera. Make sure the camera is clicking away as you loft the blimp.\nTo empty blimp, open the two release valves and gently assist pushing helium out of the blimp. Blimp needs to be completely empty before wrapping it into the tarp. Detach the short stay as before from its ribbons and fold it along the other stay for ease of transport.\nFAA regulations only permit a maximum flight height of 500\u2019, but the blimp often goes at an angle, so the spool has up to 1000\u2019 of string.\nHow high up you go depends on how wide the channel is and what resolution you are aiming for. ~250\u2019 seems like an ideal balance, but if the channel is too wide, then you might have to go up to the full 500\u2019but the closer to the ground the clearer the pictures.\nThe best approach to using the blimp is to go right up to the maximum height of 500\u2019 and do a run along the river at that height. Then drop down to the preferred height and do another run at that height to get the maximum resolution with reasonable coverage.\nDepending upon wind conditions, it may take lots of blimp manipulation (more or less height via the kite string), walking, or boat maneuvering to get the shots needed. Wind plays a big role in how much effort it takes to reel in the blimp.\nIf the blimp simply will not go up, then that tells you there is an air inversion taking place. This usually happens when hotter air gets trapped under cooler air, which we have seen several times in canyons. The cooler air prevents the blimp from rising. There is no solution other than to hold off until the next morning or when conditions change.\nUse these tables to determine the height at which the blimp is flying. The table assumes that there is no slack in the line. Remember to add the height from the ground to the position of the clinometer.\nYou will be able to see the flash flashing, so you should be able to tell if the camera is still taking pictures. I\u2019ve tried the \u2018no flash\u2019 setting and it uses up the memory card space in less than five minutes \u2013 not good.\nTypically I have the blimp lofted for 30-60 minutes per deployment. Just keep looking for the flashes and as long as that is going, then you know you are good.\nThe camera takes pictures every 5-20 s, slowing down over time. It helps to count out so you know to steady up when a photo is about to be taken.\nThe most tedious part of the deployment is reeling in the blimp. It is also the hardest part if it\u2019s windy.\nDid I mention to always have the blimp tied down? We don\u2019t want to lose it!\nIf it is windy, you may want to weigh down the tiles with a rock so they don\u2019t blow off of their GPS location.\nIt\u2019s easy to re-deploy the camera again and again once the tiles are in place.\nRecharge the camera battery between deployments!! The one battery will run out of power more quickly than our desire to get more pictures. Plug the battery and recharge unit into the inverter as soon as you have downloaded the pictures and erased them from the memory card.\nUse the time in between deployments to have a good look at the latest pictures. Use knowledge from previous deployments to figure out where you might need to walk/boat to to get pictures of other needed areas.", "German crime novelist Norman Ohler rocked the boat with historians when he published \"Blitzed,\" his well-researched and compelling argument that Adolf Hitler was high as a kite during World War II.\n\"Nazi Junkies\" (out now on DVD and Digital) is a documentary series that relies heavily on Ohler's research for \"Episode 1: Hitler the Junkie,\" digging deep into the F\u00fchrer's relationship with sketchy doctor Theodor Morell, a man whose \"vitamin shots\" were laced with cocaine and Eukodal, a German version of oxycodone.\nOhler appears in the documentary, which uses excellent footage from the war years to support the case that Hitler's questionable military decisions were fueled by the sense of invincibility his drug habit caused.\nWe've got an exclusive clip from \"Hitler the Junkie\" below.\n\"Episode 2: Nazi Junkies\" explores the widespread use of methamphetamine in the German military. After its introduction in the 1930s, Pervitin became widely used all over Germany and was even sold mixed into chocolate bars. Meth supported the booming economy, and historical records indicated that it fueled the troops during the Blitzkrieg.\nThe use of drugs in battle by the Nazis is far more established in WWII historical literature, and this episode seems to have been made before Ohler's research into Hitler caused such a stir. His book also tells this story, but the novelist-turned-historian didn't participate in this part of the documentary.\nThe filmmakers make a point of emphasizing the fact that German doctors insisted that troops have their access to Pervitin severely curtailed before they began fighting on the Eastern Front. The size of the territory they aimed to conquer was far bigger than they'd tackled in Poland and France, but could their effectiveness have also been undercut by a lack of access to drugs?\nBoth episodes make the case that drugs were a critical part of Nazi Germany's rise and fall. The conclusions are logical, and the arguments are coherent. \"Nazi Junkies\" takes these arguments from history books and shares them with the audience that loves WWII documentaries. It's worth a look.", "CARACAS, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Crystallex\u2019s victory in a legal battle with Venezuela that paves the way for it to collect a $1.4 billion award hinged on a finding that state oil company PDVSA is not separate from the Venezuelan government, court documents showed on Friday.\nThe U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware granted Crystallex\u2019s request to take ownership of shares in PDVSA subsidiary of PDVH, which owns U.S.-based refiner Citgo, as part of a decade-long dispute over the 2008 nationalization of Crystallex assets.\n\u201cCrystallex has met its burden to rebut the presumption of separateness between PDVSA and Venezuela and proven that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela,\u201d wrote Judge Leonard P. Stark in the decision.\nThe issue has been closely watched by investors holding billions of dollars in Venezuelan bonds, which are almost all in default as the OPEC nation struggles under the collapse of its socialist economy.\nLegal experts had generally believed that creditors of Venezuela, which has few foreign assets available to be seized by creditors, would have a difficult time pursuing claims against PDVSA because the two were considered separate.\nVenezuela two years ago put up 49.9 percent of Citgo shares as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian oil major Rosneft. The remaining 50.1 percent was set aside as collateral for PDVSA\u2019s 2020 bond.\nJudge Stark said the court had not yet determined when it would issue a writ allowing Crystallex to assume ownership of the shares of PDV Holding Inc, or what mechanism should be used to sell those shares.\nInformation Minister Jorge Rodriguez, asked by a reporter about the decision during a press conference on Friday, declined to comment on it.\nLegal counsel for Crystallex declined to comment.", "Opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan, who organized street protests in the Armenian capital last month, has been elected the new prime minister by the parliament. He had threatened more protests otherwise.\nPashinyan was elected by a vote of 59-42 by the parliament in the Tuesday election in the 105-seat legislature, according to Interfax. His previous attempt to secure the office last week failed when he received only 45 of the 53 votes necessary.\nHe responded with renewed street protests, pressuring the ruling Republican Party to pledge that several of its MPs would vote for him in the next election.\nThe 42-year-old charismatic politician seized a chance to get the most powerful office in Armenia by rallying public rage against his predecessor, Serzh Sargsyan, who previously served as Armenia\u2019s president. Under his term the country changed its political system from presidential to parliamentary. Sargsyan reneged on his promise not to seek the newly empowered PM\u2019s seat, sparking mass demonstrations in capital Yerevan.\nRiding the wave of the protest, Pashinyan not only pressured Sargsyan into retirement days after his election as prime minister, but also seized the office for himself. Pashinyan insists he will not stick to the position for longer than necessary to pass political liberalization reforms and said he will be the \u201cpeople\u2019s prime minister\u201d.\nPashinyan previously stated that he does not seek to change Armenia\u2019s foreign policy in any radical way.

Armenia\u2019s location and the state of relations with its neighbors make international trade very difficult, which hinders economic growth.

Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy testified he chose not to buck government overseers who selected him to run the bailed- out insurer.\nDeveloping trust with regulators was for the \u201cbenefit of AIG,\u201d he told the attorney for Maurice \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg\u2019s Starr International Co. in the trial over claims the bailout cheated the insurer\u2019s shareholders out of at least $25 billion.\nDavid Boies, the lawyer, asked him if he made any major decision without the input of Federal Reserve or U.S. Treasury Department officials.\n\u201cI could have, Mr. Boies. I just chose not to,\u201d Liddy replied.\nStarr, which was AIG\u2019s largest shareholder before the 2008 rescue, accuses the government of illegally taking 80 percent of its stock in consideration of an $85 billion bailout loan. The U.S. also broke the law by taking control of the company, Starr contends.\nThe U.S. had a hand in everything from vetting press releases to selecting AIG board members, according to testimony and documents introduced into evidence by Boies this week.\nThe AIG board voluntarily accepted the terms of the deal and its only alternative was bankruptcy, the government contends. A bailout was needed to prevent catastrophic damage to the economy, according to Kenneth Dintzer, a Justice Department lawyer.\nLiddy, a former CEO of Allstate Corp., was serving on Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s board when, according to his testimony, he was recruited to the AIG post by Christopher Cole, at the time the head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s investment banking unit.\nLiddy testified that he considered Cole an emissary of then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs CEO, who called him after he agreed to take the post.\nAnother former Goldman Sachs executive, Ken Wilson, who was serving as an adviser to Paulson, also urged him to take the position, Liddy told the court.\nStarr contends the government wanted control of AIG\u2019s assets to facilitate a \u201cbackdoor bailout\u201d of the New York- based insurer\u2019s investment bank trading partners, including Goldman Sachs, and that it manipulated the company\u2019s governance to avoid a shareholder vote on the rescue package.\nGoldman Sachs was described in Congressional testimony introduced into evidence as receiving $12.9 billion from AIG, the largest payout of counterparty funds from the insurer.\nLiddy said he agreed to serve as AIG\u2019s CEO on Sept. 16, 2008, the first day of the bailout.\nHe replaced Robert Willumstad, whose resignation was a condition of the rescue.\nBoies sought to show that Liddy was acting as CEO before he was confirmed by the AIG board on Sept. 18.\nThe lawyer confronted Liddy with talking points for a town hall meeting with AIG executives e-mailed on Sept. 17 to Sarah Dahlgren, an official with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York charged with monitoring the insurer. Dahlgren earlier testified that Liddy had requested them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember them,\u201d Liddy said.\nAlthough the details of the bailout loan weren\u2019t fully fleshed out until Sept. 22, Liddy said he felt AIG had a binding agreement with the Fed on Sept. 16, because funds were \u201cflowing.\u201d The government provided AIG with $14 billion that night, according to earlier testimony.\nA term sheet approved by regulators on Sept. 16 \u201cis what gave rise to the arrangement between the Federal Reserve and the company,\u201d Liddy said. The loan had many \u201cto-be-determined\u201d elements before it was finalized on Sept. 22, he said.\nWhen asked about some of the details of the loan, such as a provision for a trust to hold the government\u2019s stock in AIG and a requirement for equity, Liddy said \u201cthe mechanics of this were very complicated\u201d and he relied on the advice of lawyers.\nStarr\u2019s complaint alleges that the government shifted the kind of equity it demanded to preferred shares when it realized that a warrant would be subject to shareholder approval it could not win.\nLiddy testified that he concentrated on trying to lengthen the initial two-year term of the loan, and on lowering what Starr says was a 14 percent interest rate. Liddy said he regarded improving the terms as a more pressing concern than the nature of equity going to the government.\n\u201cIt was like walking on eggshells,\u201d he testified regarding efforts to get the Fed to bring down the rate.\n\u201cIt was a negotiated process,\u201d he said. The rate was lowered weeks later as part of a restructuring of financing that also included an injection of $40 billion via the Treasury from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\nLiddy is scheduled to continue his testimony today.\nhow do you figure Starr would have been wiped out?\nThe US bailout was not to save AIG, \u201cThe goal was to save the world from AIG.\u201d If not for the US govt, there wouldn't be a Starr Companies nor a US Economy!", "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Paul Harvey, the news commentator and talk-radio pioneer whose staccato style made him one of the nation\u2019s most familiar voices, died Saturday in Arizona, according to ABC Radio Networks. He was 90.\nHarvey died surrounded by family at a hospital in Phoenix, where he had a winter home, said Louis Adams, a spokesman for ABC Radio Networks, where Harvey worked for more than 50 years.\nNo cause of death was immediately available.\nHarvey composed his twice-daily news commentaries for ABC from a downtown office near Lake Michigan.\nPerhaps Harvey\u2019s most famous broadcast came in 1970, when he abandoned that stance, announcing his opposition to President Nixon\u2019s expansion of the war and urging him to get out completely.\n\u201cMr. President, I love you \u2026 but you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Harvey said, shocking his faithful listeners and drawing a barrage of letters and phone calls, including one from the White House.\nIn 1976, Harvey began broadcasting his anecdotal descriptions of the lives of famous people. \u201cThe Rest of the Story\u201d started chronologically, with the person\u2019s identity revealed at the end.

It was a dangerous industry and there was a poor safety culture, he said.\nNeither had a software background but they \"took a punt\" and found some clever people with those skills.\nZero Harm Farm offered turnkey farm safety solutions including a cloud-based safety management app, safety signs and equipment.\nThe app had a special focus on the management of contractors, rather than just employees, as it had proven difficult for farm or work site managers of remote or unmanned locations to share safety information with workers consistently.\nFarmers regularly used contractors who often worked \"outside their sphere of influence\". The digital platform was a good way to deal with that.\nZero Harm Farm relished the opportunity to pitch to Melbourne-based SproutX, seeing it as a great opportunity.\nThe intention had always been to \"go for scale\" \u2014 as a digital platform could \u2014 and it wanted to have a global reach. There were the same issues whether it was \"Ireland, UK or Canada\", he said.\nSproutX had bought into 8% of Zero Harm Farm\u2019s valuation, opening up large distribution and investment channels across Australia.\nWhile the company would now have a second office presence in Melbourne, it was business as usual for its development and support team in Queenstown.\nThe Zero Harm Farm application was launched in Australia this month during Australia\u2019s National Farm Safety Week.\nWhile a digital app would not solve every problem, Mr Orr said it was a \"cog in the wheel\" of trying to engage more people about health and safety culture and make it easier.\nHe likened it to what Xero was to accounting.\nIt was estimated $12 billion was spent in Commonwealth countries each year on compliance management and insurance.\nHe enjoyed the opportunity of working with Zero Harm Farm which was an exciting and interesting trip so far \u2014 \"just the fun of helping people, trying to solve a problem ... having a crack\", he said.", "Observers and operators gave a cautious welcome Monday to proposed changes to a draft Italian broadcasting law that has been criticised as a menace to freedom of expression on the internet.\nThe draft decree was approved last Thursday by lawmakers on committees in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies (upper and lower houses of parliament) but with a request for sweeping changes, particularly in the section governing the internet, which had aroused widespread condemnation.\nDeputy Communications Minister Paolo Romani, who was responsible for promoting the decree, said the government would \"take rigorous account\" of the lawmakers' suggestions.\n\"Given the differences in the texts approved by the Chamber and the Senate it is clear that we will have to find a way of harmonising them,\" Romani said.\nLawmakers said there would be no web censorship under the new rules.\n\"Blogs with amateur videos, online newspapers, search engines and the online versions of magazines are free, and editorial responsibility does not fall on providers who host content generated by others,\" Alessio Butti, the government lawmaker who drew up the text approved by the Senate committee, told reporters.\n\"The Chamber and Senate Commissions have proposed significant and positive changes to the draft broadcasting law,\" Marco Pancini, senior European public policy counsel for Google Italy, said in a prepared statement Monday.\nGoogle's YouTube subsidiary is being sued by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset broadcasting company for alleged copyright violation for allowing users to post videos taken from the company's three national TV networks.\nUnder the original draft of the broadcasting law, which the government says enacts a European Union directive, YouTube risked being treated as a conventional television broadcaster, requiring a special licence from the government and assuming editorial responsibility for all material uploaded to its website.\n\"It is premature to give a definitive verdict. The text still needs to be finalised and the government still needs to accept the amendments,\" Pancini's statement said.\nPaolo Nuti, president of the Association of Italian internet Providers (AIIP), said he welcomed the change of heart expressed by the parliamentary committees but pointed out that their recommendations were not binding on the government.\n\"What counts is the text that comes out from the government. There is just one problem: that the recommendations of the European Union directive on electronic commerce are incorporated into Italian law. If I don't have that written down in black and white I can't be satisfied,\" Nuti said in a telephone interview.\n\"My impression is that the government realised its text went well beyond the terms of the EU directive. Certainly the parliamentary committees have realised that.\"\nBloggers were also quick to welcome the government's apparent U-turn.\n\"This is a new U-turn made necessary by the incompetence of the geriatric ward that, unfortunately for us, on both sides of the political spectrum, occupies Italy's seats of power,\" said Andrea Guida, writing on the blog geekissimo.\n\"It seems that asking that a law on a delicate subject like the web be written by someone aged under 60 is asking too much.\"\nThe government's initial attempt to tighten control of the internet was also decried by Nicola D'Angelo, a commissioner in the Communications Authority, which is likely to be given a role in policing internet video content under the new law.\n\"Personally I am opposed to sheriffs of the web,\" D'Angelo said in an interview published Saturday by the Turin daily La Stampa. \"There is a general tendency to try to exercise greater control over internet. That is particularly grave in a country like ours where other forms of communication already show signs of a heavy concentration.\"\nMuch of that concentration is in the hands of Silvio Berlusconi, whose family owns newspapers, magazines, book publishers and three national TV networks, and who exercises indirect control of the state broadcaster RAI through parliament.\nIt will be reassuring for Berlusconi to know that one of the people responsible for rewriting the law in the Chamber of Deputies committee is Deborah Bergamini, a member of his People of Freedom Party and his former personal assistant. Bergamini was briefly suspended from her duties as a director of marketing when she worked previously for RAI over allegations that she maintained telephone contact with colleagues at Mediaset to coordinate coverage of major news events.", "While much of the high-tech industry has spent the last several months focusing on security\u2014for their information as well as their physical assets\u2014a small but growing number of influential executives has been working toward the long-term goal of making the security industry obsolete.\n\"The security industry as we know it today goes away in 10 years,\" said Chris Darby, CEO of @Stake Inc., a security consultancy and research company in Cambridge, Mass.\nAs things stand now, the security market is a confusing and fractured m\u00e9lange of technologies with exotic-sounding names such as firewall and IDS (intrusion detection system). Vendors in every segment tout their wares as the final piece of the puzzle, the magic potion that promises to make an IT managers security headaches vanish.\nThey play on customers fears, telling them there are dozens, if not hundreds, of vulnerabilities in the software on which theyre running their enterprises and that the only way to keep corporate data safe is to install yet another layer of security.\nHowever, the dirty little secret of the security industry is that if the big software vendors paid more attention to security, security hardware and software vendors would be out of business, according to experts.\nAnd thats exactly the scenario that companies such as @Stake, Microsoft Corp. and others are trying to bring about.\nMicrosoft has long been a favorite target of crackers, much to the displeasure of customers that have been burned by vulnerabilities in the companys broad line of software. Microsoft has been quick to issue patches when someone identifies a new flaw in one of its products, but this spring, the company launched Trustworthy Computing, an all-out effort to improve the security of its products during the design and development phase, something its critics have suggested for years.\nThe main focus of the effort is training developers to write secure code and eliminate common and easily exploitable vulnerabilities such as buffer overruns. @Stake, which offers secure-coding training services, has seen a lot of demand for those services in recent months.\nSuch training and coding practices should lead to more secure products in the short term and in the long term, to a marked decrease in the number of vulnerabilities in corporate networks, which will mean fewer successful attacks, security insiders claim.\nAnd that, in turn, will mean less demand for security countermeasures such as firewalls and IDSes.\n\"In the long term, over time, as we design more-secure products, what we should see\u2014what wed better see\u2014is fewer successful attacks, better stability and better security,\" said Scott Charney, chief security strategist at Microsoft, in Redmond, Wash. \"We should be able to measure and say vulnerabilities are going down. Things should improve.\"\nBut \"should\" is far different from \"will.\" Many of the common vulnerabilities that crackers use to invade corporate networks and Web servers have been around for years, if not decades. Buffer overruns, for example, were identified as early as the 1960s, and yet they continue to show up in new software packages such as Windows XP.\nThis leads some security experts to challenge the notion that the security industry is on the verge of collapsing.\n\"Todays simple-to-fix vulnerabilities, like buffer overflows, will likely be gone [in 10 years],\" said Steven Bellovin, AT&T fellow in the Network Services Research Lab at AT&T Labs Research, in Florham Park, N.J., and a pioneer in network security. \"But more complex semantic problems will remain. Most security holes are caused by buggy code. Buggy code is the oldest problem in computer science, and I see no reason to think that will change.\n\"Well make progress\u2014but its fundamentally a very hard, and possibly insoluble, problem,\" Bellovin said. \"I also think that the right approach for systems architects is to design their systems differently. A lot more has to be done to understand what the security-sensitive modules are so that they can be made as small as possible and can be properly isolated from the rest of the system.\"\nBut in the end, @Stakes Darby said he believes that the changes being made by companies such as Microsoft are moving the industry inexorably toward a fundamental shift.\n\"The notion of overlaying security products on networks after the fact is inefficient,\" Darby said. \"And technology in the long run is about efficiency.\"\nThe changes that Darby, Charney and others envision for the security industry will not happen overnight. But if they do occur, users will eventually be better off, experts say. \"I think that Microsoft will apply a lot of effort to fix their security problems because it seems that they have been ridiculed to the point that they have finally decided to get right with God,\" said Phil Zimmermann, chief cryptographer at Hush Communications Corp., based in Dublin, Ireland, and inventor of the PGP e-mail encryption program. \"I think Linux, FreeBSD and Apple [Computer Inc.] will try to reach parity with OpenBSD in security discipline. These changes will take years but will eventually bear fruit. Firewalls and IDS as add-on products will become less needed.\"", "When the first live-action Transformers movie broke out and made millions at the box office, there was a sudden rush to make movies about giant fighting robots. For awhile that meant there were several different efforts underway to turn the classic animated series Voltron: Defender of the Universe into a feature film, but nothing ever came of it. Now they\u2019re trying again.\nRelativity Media, the company behind such upcoming movies as Immortals and The Raven just informed us they\u2019re teaming up with Atlas Entertainment to bring Voltron to the big screen.\nThe original show, based on a series of Japanese anime properties, was big in kid\u2019s programming back in 1984. It involved a team of five young warriors who drive robot lions which can connect together to form one giant, humanoid, fighting robot named \u201cVoltron\u201d. Remember Power Rangers? It\u2019s basically that except set in a dystopian future.\nIn recent years the show has returned to the airwaves with a new Voltron Force series on Nickelodeon. If you have kids, maybe you noticed. The show still has a big fanbase, but if I were Relativity I\u2019d be more excited about the toy sales possibilites if they actually get this off the ground. Back in 1984 the Voltron toys were much lusted after. I never could convince my parents to buy them, but my cousin had all five lions and whenever I went over to his house, formed them up into Voltron as if to taunt me. Ok he probably wasn\u2019t really taunting me, but those goddamn robots still haunt me. I need that toy, like, now.\nThe live action film is slated to be produced by Atlas Entertainment\u2019s Charles Roven (who worked on The Dark Knight) among others. They\u2019ve hired Thomas Dean Donnelly, who wrote the Conan remake script, to write it along with Josh Oppenheimer.\nBefore you get too excited, remember this is at least the fourth time in the past ten years someone has tried to make a movie out of Voltron, and somehow it\u2019s never actually gotten done. There have been other scripts and other producers, nothing ever came of them. Hopefully this production will fare better.", "A growing body of research about trends in educational technology, presented at the annual conference of the American Educational Research Association, raises important questions about how digital tools are being used inside and outside of schools. How effective, for instance, is online credit recovery? And what does the new \"digital divide\" look like?\nHigh school students who took an online makeup course after failing Algebra 1 had lower scores, grades, and credit-recovery rates than their peers who took the same course in a traditional face-to-face setting, according to new research from the American Institutes for Research.\nHowever, while students benefited from the face-to-face credit-recovery course in the short term, the long-term impact appeared to be minimal. Successfully making up Algebra 1 via a credit-recovery class of either type did not appear to lead to students becoming more likely to succeed in more-advanced math classes later in high school, or becoming more likely to graduate.\nThe \u201cBack on Track\u201d study, presented as a series of research briefs at the AERA conference, represents one of the first comprehensive examinations of how online credit recovery impacts student achievement and outcomes.\nThe study covers 1,224 9th grade students from 17 Chicago public schools who failed Algebra 1 and enrolled in summer school in 2011 or 2012. According to the primary brief released this month, titled \u201cComparing the Effectiveness of Online and Face-to-Face Credit Recovery in Algebra 1,\u201d that subject was picked because more students fail Algebra 1 than any other course, and doing so leaves them particularly unlikely to graduate.\n66 percent of students who took the online Algebra 1 makeup course successfully recovered credit, compared with 76 percent of students who took the face-to-face version of the course.\nFlorida public schools have made dramatic strides in providing students with equitable access to computers, but a divide continues to separate how poor and more affluent students actually use that digital technology, according to new research presented at the AERA gathering.\nThe shape of the new digital divide: Low-income Florida students are more likely to use software for drill-and-kill practice of basic skills than their more affluent peers, who are more likely to use software in ways that foster creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.\nThe disparity is particularly pronounced at the elementary level.\nRitzhaupt\u2019s paper, titled \u201cA Longitudinal Study of the Digital Divide in Florida Schools: Beyond Access,\u201d was co-authored with Kara Dawson and Matthew Wilson of the University of Florida and Tina Hohlfeld of the University of South Florida. The study relies on seven years\u2019 worth of survey data, which the state collected from public K-12 schools as part of Florida\u2019s Technology Resource Inventory in each year from 2008-09 to 2014-15. All told, 2,244 schools from 67 districts are represented in the study.\nStudents in lower-income elementary schools were consistently more likely than their more affluent peers to use classroom software for \u201cdirected instruction\u201d type activities, such as drill-and-practice.\nStudents in higher-income elementary schools, on the other hand, were more likely than their low-income peers to use classroom software for \u201cconstructivist\u201d purposes, such as creating (via software for painting/drawing and creating desktop videos and presentations), engaging with simulations, using tool-based software (such as graphic organizers, spreadsheets, and databases), and conducting research.\nCan Ed Tech Power a Social-Justice Approach to \u2018Disruption\u2019?\nEducational technology is often discussed in terms of its transformative potential: to personalize teaching, to put students in control of their own learning, to take schools out of the Industrial Age, to better prepare young people for a rapidly changing economy.\nBut new research presented at the AERA conference outlined a more radical vision: By leveraging the ubiquity of mobile devices and the power of new digital tools for everything from mapping to media creation, students at the bottom of America\u2019s social and economic ladder can be empowered to change the policies and conditions that limit their opportunities for success, says San Francisco State University African studies professor Antwi Akom.\nAkom presented his research, titled \u201cYouth Participatory Action Research 2.0: How Technological Innovation and Digital Organizing Sparked a Food Revolution in East Oakland,\u201d at the AERA annual conference. It is pending publication in the academic journal Qualitative Studies of Education.\nThe work, which falls to the left on the political spectrum, will surely ruffle some feathers.\nAnd even those who embrace the approach\u2014including Oakland Unified School District educator Timothy Bremner, who partnered with Akom several years ago to test an early version of the \u201cYPAR 2.0\u201d model in his classroom\u2014say that implementing and scaling the model inside schools can be exceptionally challenging.\n\u201cBridging the Digital Divide in Classrooms,\u201d July 2, 2014.", "Data pirates, watch out. The real estate industry is coming after you \u2014 collectively.\nThat\u2019s one message a new nonprofit organization created to protect the intellectual property rights of multiple listing services and brokerages wants to convey. Here\u2019s another: It needs members to join the cause.\nREDPLAN Inc., which stands for Real Estate Data Protection Legal Association Nonprofit, incorporated in Delaware at the end of June. The 501(c)(6) organization will hold its first board meeting on Tuesday, July 9.\nGregg Larson, founder and CEO of Clareity Consulting Inc. and Clareity Security, has spearheaded the effort and is one of REDPLAN\u2019s five founding board members. The others are John Mosey, CEO of St. Paul, Minn.-based NorthstarMLS; Martin Scrocchi, CEO of paperless transaction management firm Instanet Solutions; Jay Gaskill, CEO of real estate technology company Real Estate Digital; and Claude Szyfer, an antitrust lawyer and partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP.\nOne of REDPLAN\u2019s main goals is to inform those who scrape MLS data without permission, known as \u201cdata pirates\u201d or \u201cdata scrapers,\u201d that MLSs will enforce their intellectual property rights, Larson said.\n\u201cThere are dozens of operators that have been stealing data for decades and have been able to stay underground or nearly underground and aren\u2019t afraid of MLSs. There just hasn\u2019t been a national deterrent,\u201d he said.\nThus far, any attempts to stop data pirates have been made on an individual basis with each MLS or brokerage engaging their own local attorneys, even when a scraper has been operating in multiple cities nationwide, Larson said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very uncoordinated approach and it\u2019s very fragmented,\u201d he said.\nLarson envisions REDPLAN as an organization that will allow members to share information and serve as a \u201ccentral office\u201d for alerts and advisories concerning data theft and misuse. It will also be a legal clearinghouse where the board will decide the most important cases to pursue to best promote the industry\u2019s intellectual property rights and will proactively investigate possible copyright violations, he said.\nREDPLAN will target specifically the types of litigation that will protect not just some firms, but the entire industry, Szyfer said.\n\u201cUnless there is widespread action against these infringers, there is little incentive for them to stop stealing your intellectual property,\u201d he said.\nThe harm to MLSs from data pirates is twofold, according to Szyfer.\n\u201cThey\u2019re diverting sales away from your agents and diverting money from the MLSs,\u201d he said.\nThe MLS\u2019 reputation is also at stake. \u201cIf the information on (a scraper\u2019s site) is wrong, the presumption is it\u2019s coming from you,\u201d he said.\nUnlike large data firms like CoreLogic, most MLSs do not have the staff to ensure compliance with intellectual property laws, Larson said.\n\u201cLarger MLS organizations have compliance staff and they have some of the skills to dig deeper and \u2026 do investigations, to prove there\u2019s a violation. But for the most part, MLSs, associations and brokers do not have the technical staff to do this. They don\u2019t have the time or they don\u2019t have the talents,\u201d he said.\nInitially, REDPLAN will have a small staff, including a full-time administrator to be hired sometime next year and founding board member and attorney Claude Szyfer. Clareity\u2019s chief technologist, Matt Cohen, will coordinate investigations into possible violations.\nSzyfer will be on hand at least partially to combat any allegations of antitrust, Larson said.\n\u201cAnytime real estate organizations and brokers and franchisors get together behind something there is the potential for somebody to scream antitrust. There (is) still a lot of existing law that intellectual property owners have every right to get together and collectively protect their intellectual property, as has the music industry and the software industry,\u201d Larson said.\nREDPLAN will coordinate and help fund lawsuits, but it will not be suing data pirates itself because it does not own the data, Larson said. Members will sue with REDPLAN\u2019s help, he said.\nVia its standing as an association, REDPLAN could also help class-action lawsuits take hold so that MLSs, brokerages and other companies do not have to \u201cfight for the protection of their intellectual property rights through individualized, and inefficient, isolated litigation,\u201d the organization said on its website.\nThe idea of forming an MLS copyright enforcement group came up last fall at the Council of Multiple Listing Services\u2019 annual conference. Two attorneys, one of them a legal services exec at the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), suggested MLSs take a cue from the music industry and form a group to collectively enforce copyright rights, spread the risk and cost of litigation, and develop a coordinated strategy to combat piracy and shape laws in their favor.\nThe proposal was prompted partially by copyright infringement lawsuits filed by two large MLSs, Rockville, Md.-based Metropolitan Regional Information Systems Inc. (MRIS) and St. Paul, Minn.-based NorthstarMLS, against the owner and operator of agent ratings and referrals site NeighborCity.com.\nJohn Mosey, NorthstarMLS\u2019 CEO, said he was asked to be a founding board member for REDPLAN because he has been a long-term advocate of defending the intellectual property rights of MLS stakeholders.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a NeighborCity thing for me; albeit, I can see actors in our industry such as NeighborCity becoming the object of REDPLAN\u2019s attention,\u201d he said.\nFounding board member Jay Gaskill of Real Estate Digital said that as an MLS data aggregator, his company competes against data scrapers all the time.\nWhile in the very long term, Gaskill anticipates REDPLAN\u2019s efforts could make for a more level playing field for his company in the marketplace, he said he joined the organization primarily because he sees it as a benefit to his clients.\n\u201cAs a vendor in the industry \u2014 one that takes the intellectual property rights of our real estate broker clients and MLS clients seriously \u2014 anything that would help that cause we\u2019re going to support,\u201d he said.\nHe made sure to note that REDPLAN is not affiliated at all from a commercial point of view with his company, RED.\nREDPLAN leaders say one of the organization\u2019s aims it to collaborate on best practices for protecting intellectual property in the industry.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the guys in the white hats trying to educate and inform people about their intellectual property and in this case work together to defend it,\u201d Larson said.\nHe anticipates that members and their attorneys will share language for licensing agreements, for instance, and provide information on how to best copyright MLS data in their jurisdiction and ensure they have the rights to the content, such as photographs, entered into the MLS.\n\u201cA lot of (MLSs) don\u2019t know how to register copyright \u2026 so they\u2019re underprotected or not protected at all,\u201d Larson said.\nClareity has been involved with intellectual property rights since 1996, Larson said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of history with this stuff and we\u2019ve watched a number of clients over the years spend millions and millions of dollars in legal fees. We have a pretty strong opinion on this,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always new technology that comes out. Part of keeping up with technology (means you) have to continue to protect IP rights,\u201d he added.\nAnd just as the industry\u2019s technology has advanced, so has that of scrapers. \u201cAny 14-year-old kid can go out and scrape,\u201d Larson said.\nREDPLAN is currently recruiting additional board members and reviewing nominations. The permanent board will eventually have between 11 and 13 members with seats reserved for a local or state association executive, three MLS executives, three industry vendors, a consultant, and three to five large brokers or franchisors.\nThe company also hopes to recruit thousands of members that represent the entire industry. Applications can be submitted through the company\u2019s members-only association management platform: redplan.wildapricot.org.\nAnnual membership fees are posted on the platform and range from $1,500 for an MLS or association with 500 members or less to $20,000 for a technology company with more than $200 million in gross annual revenue; a legal, consulting, media or publishing firm with more than $200 million in revenue; or a brokerage or franchisor with more than $100 million in revenue.\nREDPLAN also offers a maximum of three \u201cClass A\u201d memberships for national associations or technology companies that guarantee a board seat for $200,000.\nAll other board members are volunteers and will pay the usual membership fees according to their organization\u2019s size, Larson said. Any interested in applying or submitting board member nominations should get in touch with him, he said.\nThe board is looking for incoming board members who are smart, passionate for the cause, and who will make a difference, Larson said.\nInstanet\u2019s Martin Scrocchi did not return a request for comment by publication time.\nInstanet has had its own experience with copyright litigation.\nIn 2010, Real Estate Industry Solutions LLC, a now-defunct for-profit subsidiary of Florida Realtors, filed a copyright suit against Instanet for allegedly appropriating its Form Simplicity transaction forms.\nInstanet countersued, alleging Form Simplicity was based on software code and other confidential information from Instanet\u2019s own transaction management platforms. The companies settled the suit in May 2012 with each side paying its own costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to note that REDPLAN is a 501 (c)(6) nonprofit, not a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.", "Governor Deval Patrick brought his gubernatorial campaign to Shirley Avenue Saturday afternoon under brilliant sunshine on a gorgeous fall day.\nAbout 100 residents flocked around the governor, exchanging conversations with him and wishing him well across the street from the Bagel Bin following a sign holding visibility on Broadway earlier in the morning.\nThe governor then went into the Bagel Bin where he was joined by dozens of supporters and Speaker of the House Robert DeLeo who gave the governor a rousing speech in support of his candidacy.\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to be here in Revere,\u201d the governor told the crowd outside the Bagel Bin.

Lewontin and Richard Levins have been colleagues and comrades for over forty years. They are the authors of The Dialectical Biologist (Harvard University Press, 1987), and Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA (HarperCollins, 1992). Lewontin is Research Professor in Biology at Harvard and taught a joint course in evolution with Steve Gould. Levins is the head of the Human Ecology program at the Harvard School of Public Health.\nEarly this year, Stephen Gould developed lung cancer, which spread so quickly that there was no hope of survival. He died on May 20, 2002, at the age of sixty. Twenty years ago, he had escaped death from mesothelioma, induced, we all supposed, by some exposure to asbestos. Although his cure was complete, he never lost the consciousness of his mortality and gave the impression, at least to his friends, of an almost cheerful acceptance of the inevitable. Having survived one cancer that was probably the consequence of an environmental poison, he succumbed to another.\nThe public intellectual and political life of Steve Gould was extraordinary, if not unique. First, he was an evolutionary biologist and historian of science whose intellectual work had a major impact on our views of the process of evolution. Second, he was, by far, the most widely known and influential expositor of science who has ever written for a lay public. Third, he was a consistent political activist in support of socialism and in opposition to all forms of colonialism and oppression. The figure he most closely resembled in these respects was the British biologist of the 1930\u2019s, J. B. S. Haldane, a founder of the modern genetical theory of evolution, a wonderful essayist on science for the general public, and an idiosyncratic Marxist and columnist for the Daily Worker who finally split with the Communist Party over its demand that scientific claims follow Party doctrine.\nWhat characterizes Steve Gould\u2019s work is its consistent radicalism. The word radical has come to be synonymous with extreme in everyday usage: Monthly Review is a radicaljournal to the readers of the Progressive; Steve Gould underwent radical surgery when tumors were removed from his brain; and a radicalis someone who is out in left (or right) field. But a brief excursion into the Oxford English Dictionary reminds us that the root of the word radical is, in fact, radix, the Latin word for root. To be radical is to consider things from their very root, to go back to square one, to try to reconstitute one\u2019s actions and ideas by building them from first principles. The impulse to be radical is the impulse to ask, \u0093How do I know that?\u0094 and, \u0093Why am I following this course rather than another?\u0094 Steve Gould had that radical impulse and he followed it where it counted.\nFirst, Steve was a radical in his science. His best-known contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium that he developed with his colleague Niles Eldridge. The standard theory of the change in the shape of organisms over evolutionary time is that it occurs constantly, slowly, and gradually with more or less equal changes happening in equal time intervals. This seems to be the view that Darwin had, although almost anything can be read from Darwin\u2019s nineteenth century prose. Modern genetics has shown that any heritable change in development that is at all likely to survive will cause only a slight change in the organism, that such mutations occur at a fairly constant rate over long time periods and that the force of natural selection for such small changes is also of small magnitude. These facts all point to a more or less constant and slow change in species over long periods.\nWhen one looks at the fossil record, however, observed changes are much more irregular. There are more or less abrupt changes in shape between fossils that succeed each other in geological time with not much evidence for the supposed gradual intermediates between them. The usual explanation is that fossils are relatively rare and we are only seeing occasional snapshots of the actual progression of organisms. This is a perfectly coherent theory, but Eldridge and Gould went back to square one, and questioned whether the rate of change under natural selection was really as constant as everybody assumed. By examining a few fossil series in which there was a much more complete temporal record than is usual, they found evidence of long periods of virtually no change punctuated by short periods during which most of the change in shape appeared to occur. They generalized this finding into a theory that evolution occurs in fits and starts and provided several possible explanations, including that much of evolution occurred after sudden major changes in environment. Steve Gould went even further in his emphasis on the importance of major irregular events in the history of life. He placed great importance on sudden mass extinction of species after collisions of large comets with the Earth and the subsequent repopulation of the living world from a restricted pool of surviving species. The temptation to see some simple connection between Steve\u2019s theory of episodic evolution and his adherence to Marx\u2019s theory of historical stages should be resisted. The connection is much deeper. It lies in his radicalism.\nAnother aspect of Gould\u2019s radicalism in science was in the form of his general approach to evolutionary explanation. Most biologists concerned with the history of life and its present geographical and ecological distribution assume that natural selection is the cause of all features of living and extinct organisms and that the task of the biologist, insofar as it is to provide explanations, is to come up with a reasonable story of why any particular feature of a species was favored by natural selection. If, when the human species lost most of its body hair in evolving from its ape-like ancestor, it still held on to eyebrows, then eyebrows must be good things. A great emphasis of Steve\u2019s scientific writing was to reject this simplistic Panglossian adaptationism, and to go back to the variety of fundamental biological processes in the search for the causes of evolutionary change. He argued that evolution was a result of random as well as selective forces and that characteristics may be the physical byproducts of selection for other traits. He also argued strongly for the historical contingency of evolutionary change. Something may be selected for some reason at one time and then for an entirely different reason at another time, so that the end product is the result of the whole history of an evolutionary line, and cannot be accounted for by its present adaptive significance. Thus, for instance, humans are the way we are because land vertebrates reduced many fin patterns to four limbs, mammals\u2019 hearts happen to lean to the left while birds\u2019 hearts lean to the right, the bones of the inner ear were part of the jaw of our reptilian ancestors, and it just happened to get dry in east Africa at a crucial time in our evolutionary history. Therefore, if intelligent life should ever visit us from elsewhere in the universe, we should not expect them to have a human shape, suffer from sexist hierarchy, or have a command deck on their space ship.\nGould also emphasized the importance of developmental relations between different parts of an organism. A famous case was his study of the Irish elk, a very large extinct deer with enormous antlers, much greater in proportion to the animal\u2019s size than is seen in modern deer. The invented adaptationist story was that male deer antlers are under constant natural selection to increase in size because males use them in combat when they compete for access to females. The Irish elk pushed the evolution of this form of machismo too far and their antlers became so unwieldy that they could not carry on the normal business of life and so became extinct. What Steve showed was that for deer in general, species with larger body size have antlers that are more than proportionately larger, a consequence of a differential growth rate of body size and antler size during development. In fact, Irish elk had antlers of exactly the size one would predict from their body size and no special story of natural selection is required.\nNone of Gould\u2019s arguments about the complexity of evolution overthrows Darwin. There are no new paradigms, but perfectly respectable \u0093normal science\u0094 that adds richness to Darwin\u2019s original scheme. They typify his radical rule for explanation: always go back to basic biological processes and see where that takes you.\nSteve Gould\u2019s greatest fame was not as a biologist but as an explicator of science for a lay public, in lectures, essays, and books. The relation between scientific knowledge and social action is a problematic one. Scientific knowledge is an esoteric knowledge, possessed and understood by a small elite, yet the use and control of that knowledge by private and public powers is of great social consequence to all. How is there to be even a semblance of a democratic state when vital knowledge is in the hands of a self-interested few? The glib answer offered is that there are instruments of the popularization of science, chiefly science journalism and the popular writings of scientists, which create an informed public. But that popularization is itself usually an instrument of obfuscation and the pressing of elite agendas.\nScience journalists suffer from a double disability: First, no matter how well educated, intelligent, and well-motivated, they must, in the end, trust what scientists tell them. Even a biologist must trust what a physicist says about quantum mechanics. A large fraction of science reporting begins with a press conference or release produced by a scientific institution. \u0093Scientists at the Blackleg Institute announced today the discovery of the gene for susceptibility to repetitive motion injury.\u0094 Second, the media for which science reporters work put immense pressure on them to write dramatic accounts. Where is the editor who will allot precious column inches to an article about science whose message is that it is all very complicated, that no predictions can be made, that there are serious experimental difficulties in the way of finding the truth of the matter, and that we may never know the answer? Third, the esoteric nature of scientific knowledge places almost insuperable rhetorical barriers between even the most knowledgeable journalist and the reader. It is not generally realized that a transparent explanation in terms accessible to the lay reader requires the deepest possible knowledge of the matter on the part of the writer.\nScientists, and their biographers, who write books for a lay public are usually concerned to press uncritically the romance of the intellectual life, the wonders of their science, and to propagandize for yet greater support of their work. Where is the heart so hardened that it cannot be captivated by Stephen Hawking and his intellectual enterprise? Even when the intention is simply to inform a lay public about a body of scientific knowledge, the complications of the actual state of understanding are so great that the pressure to tell a simple and appealing story is irresistible.\nSteve Gould was an exception. His three hundred essays on scientific questions, published in his monthly column in Natural History Magazine, many of which were widely distributed in book form, combined a truthful and subtle explication of scientific findings and problems, with a technique of exposition that neither condescended to his readers nor oversimplified the science. He told the complex truth in a way that his lay readers could understand, while enlivening his prose with references to baseball, choral music, and church architecture. Of course, when we consider writing for a popular audience, we have to be clear about what we mean by popular. The Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano asked what we mean by writing for \u0093the people\u0094 when most of our people are illiterate. In the North there is less formal illiteracy, but Gould wrote for a highly educated, even if nonspecialist, audience for whom choral music and church architecture provided more meaningful metaphors than the scientific ideas themselves.\nMost of the subjects Steve dealt with were meant to be illustrative precisely of the complexity and diversity of the processes and products of evolution. Despite the immense diversity of matters on which he wrote there was, underneath, a unifying theme: that the complexity of the living world cannot be treated as a manifestation of some grand general principle, but that each case must be understood by examining it from the ground up and as the realization of one out of many material paths of causation.\nIn his political life Steve was part of the general movement of the left. He was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement, in the work of Science for the People, and of the New York Marxist School. He identified himself as a Marxist but, like Darwinism, it is never quite certain what that identification implies. Despite our close comradeship in many things over many years, we never had a discussion of Marx\u2019s theory of history or of political economy. More to the point, however, by insisting on his adherence to a Marxist viewpoint, he took the opportunity offered to him by his immense fame and legitimacy as a public intellectual to make a broad public think again about the validity of a Marxist analysis.\nAt the level of actual political struggles, his most important activities were in the fight against creationism and in the campaign to destroy the legitimacy of biological determinism including sociobiology and racism. He argued before the Arkansas State Legislature that differences among evolutionists or unsolved evolutionary problems do not undermine the demonstration of evolution as an organizing principle for understanding life. He was one of the authors of the original manifesto challenging the claim of sociobiology that there is an evolutionarily derived and hard-wired human nature that guarantees the perpetuation of war, racism, the inequality of the sexes, and entrepreneurial capitalism. He continued throughout his career to attack this ideology and show the shallowness of its supposed roots in genetics and evolution. His most significant contribution to the delegitimation of biological determinism, however, was his widely read exposure of the racism and dishonesty of prominent scientists, The Mismeasure of Man. Here again, Gould showed the value of going back to square one.\nNot content simply to show the evident class prejudice and racism expressed by American, English, and European biologists, anthropologists, and psychologists prior to the Second World War, he actually examined the primary data on which they based their claims of the larger brains and superior minds of northern Europeans. In every case the samples had been deliberately biased, or the data misrepresented, or even invented, or the conclusions misstated. The consistently fraudulent data on IQ produced by Cyril Burt had already been exposed by Leo Kamin, but this might have been dismissed as unique pathology in an otherwise healthy body of inquiry. The evidence produced by Steve Gould of pervasive data cooking by an array of prominent investigators made it clear that Burt was not aberrant, but typical.

Thousands of healthy Americans are losing their current insurance and may have to pay higher premiums for new health care coverage.\nAndrew Leonard is a 26-year-old information technology consultant. He's losing his health coverage because it does not meet the standards required under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Leonard says a new plan will cost him three times as much, and the only expanded coverage he will receive is for medical care for children.\nDr. Kavita Patel, a health care reform expert at the Brookings Institution, says in many cases new policies are required under Obamacare to ensure equal coverage for men and women, with children or without, to equally share costs.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to pay more just because you are a woman, which is what had been happening before. So, as a result, we have a much more nationwide policy that does not necessarily penalize you for being a woman, and as a result of that we\u2019ve got benefits that apply to both men and women,\" said Patel.\nBut she says these changes should not significantly increase the cost of plans and that most young people will qualify for a government subsidy when they enroll.\nCritics of Obamacare, like Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, say the law is too complex and gives government too much control over the system.\n\u201cIt's a law transforming our health care delivery system in the wrong direction, we believe, by increasing premiums, canceling insurance plans, destroying relationships with doctors, raising taxes,\" said Alexander.\nAndrew Leonard says if he can\u2019t find an affordable alternative, he may drop his insurance completely and pay a fine for not having coverage.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t researched it enough, but if it ends up being that it is cheaper to go without health insurance, I just won\u2019t go to the doctor most of the year.

Should you file?\nProperty Tax Grievance. Should you file?\nDo you think you\u2019re paying too much in property taxes, but don\u2019t know where to start in order to prove this? Compare how much other similar properties are paying to what you are paying and double-check several other details about your property, then decide if you have a case for filing for property tax grievance (remember that Grievance Day for NYC falls on March 15, 2016!).\nAfter you locate your property\u2019s address on the map, you\u2019ll have to do some clicking on the parcels in the immediate vicinity to see how much others are paying. This information is displayed at the top of the mini report available for each property, making it very easy for you to compare the tax amount you are paying with what another property is paying.\nIf you don\u2019t want to hire someone specialized to mine the data for you, there are a couple of things you can do on your own. First of all, you need to get on the New York Department of Taxation and Finance\u2019s website and learn as much as you can about the grievance procedures and forms.\nWhat your neighbors with similar homes are paying in taxes \u2013 your appraiser might have taken into account other properties which are not similar to yours.\nOf course, you don\u2019t have to go knocking on people\u2019s doors to find out how much they pay in taxes.

Jungers, Ph.D., a paleoanthropologist at Stony Brook University Medical Center, and his colleagues in Hawaii, Oregon, Massachusetts and Madagascar have been reunited and reconstructed via computed tomography (CT) technology by collaborators at Pennsylvania State University. The team used CT scanning and computerization to virtually glue newly discovered skull fragments of a rare extinct lemur found in 2003 back into its partial skull, originally discovered in 1899 and housed in Vienna, Austria. An article describing the work will be published in the early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences during the week of July 28, 2008.\nThe result of the digital manipulation is a nearly complete skull of Hadropithecus stenognathus, which is one of only two known skulls for this extinct lemur. To date scientists have known little about this giant lemur, the size of a large baboon, because few of its fossil remains have been found until recently by Dr. Jungers and colleagues. The first specimens, partial skull pieces, found by fossil collector Franz Sikora in Madagascar in 1899 and the early 1900s are in Vienna. The modern finds of frontal skull bone pieces remain in the United States.\n\"Hadropithecus stenognathus is a poorly known and enigmatic 'monkey lemur' that went extinct in the recent past, but this new virtual restoration offers a fascinating glimpse into the brain and skull of what appears to be one of the most advanced giant lemurs,\" said Dr. Jungers.\n\"From the moment we combined the two datasets, it was obvious that the fossils belonged to the same individual,\" said Timothy Ryan, Ph.D., anthropologist and lead author of the PNAS paper, titled \"A reconstruction of the Vienna skull of Hadropithecus stenognathus.\"\n\"Because the newly discovered fragments fit into the skull so cleanly, we decided to attempt a more thorough virtual reconstruction,\" said Dr. Ryan. \"All the work was with the help of computers and neither all the scientists nor all of the specimens were ever in the same room.\"\nThe end result was a beautiful image and three-dimensional print of the skull of the extinct lemur species that opened doors to new findings. For the first time, its cranial capacity (115 ml.) has been measured accurately. The team could also estimate its body size reliably from limb bones, as well as figure out accurate brain measurements. Hadropithecus not only had one of the largest brains relative to its body size of any known prosimian (a group of lemurs, lorises, and other similar animals), it also had a brain as large as that of some large monkeys.\nOther members of the research team included D.A. Burney, National Tropical Botanical Garden, Kaleheo, Hawaii; L.R. Godfrey, University of Massachusetts; U.B. Gohlich, National History Museum of Vienna; N.Vasey, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon; Ramilisonia, Musee d'Art Archeologie, in Madagascar; A.

The federal government claimed Switzer received confidential information and then traded stocks based on that information for his own financial benefit.\nThe entire case, according to court records and lawyers involved in the case, came down to the believability of Switzer\u2019s testimony. Likewise, many legal experts believe the SEC\u2019s ongoing insider trading trial against Cuban rests on whether jurors believe the Dallas billionaire when he testified last week.\n\u201cThe similarities between the two cases \u2014 factually and legally \u2014 are striking,\u201d said former SEC senior lawyer Jeff Ansley, who is now a lawyer at Bell Nunnally in Dallas.\nThe SEC claims Cuban received confidential information about Mamma.com and then sold more than 600,000 shares of his stock the day before the information went public. The information involved a private stock offering, which would have diluted the value of Cuban\u2019s shares by about $750,000.\nThe trial, which enters day eight on Tuesday, is expected to conclude this week.\nVery few SEC prosecutions of high-profile defendants make it to trial. Those individuals usually decide to cut a deal or negotiate a settlement, which is cheaper than paying the legal fees to go to court.\nBut Switzer and now Cuban are different.\n\u201cThere are definitely parallels in the two cases,\u201d said Jason Ross, a white-collar criminal defense lawyer at Dykema. \u201cBoth defendants are sports celebrities. Neither worried about the legal fees. In both cases, the SEC was applying the insider trading laws aggressively in ways they haven\u2019t done previously.\n\u201cAnd both cases relied on whether you believed the defendant,\u201d Ross said.\nHarry Woods, an Oklahoma City lawyer who represented a co-defendant in the Switzer case, says the SEC brought the Switzer case because he was so high profile.\n\u201cThe SEC wanted to make an example of Barry Switzer \u2026 which may be what is happening to Mr. Cuban,\u201d Woods said.\nSwitzer had previously signed several autographs for Platt and agreed to consider upgrading Platts\u2019 season tickets for Sooner football games.\nAccording to Switzer\u2019s testimony, he walked around the stadium meeting a few hundred supporters, but needed to rest during a long afternoon break in the track meet.\nSwitzer testified that he \u201claid down on the bleachers behind the Platts to sunbathe,\u201d according to court records.\nAs the football coach lay there, he overheard Platt telling his wife that he needed to return to New York because Phoenix was planning to hire the investment firm Morgan Stanley to conduct a liquidation of the company the next week.\nSwitzer said that he did not discuss the matter directly with Platt and that Platt was not aware of Switzer\u2019s presence on the bleachers behind him, court records show.\nThe next day, Switzer informed two friends about the information and together they purchased tens-of-thousands of shares of Phoenix stock, which they sold days later, pocketing about $600,000.\nThe federal judge ruled in favor of Switzer, citing his testimony as irrefutable.\nBrad Foster, a securities litigator at Andrews Kurth in Dallas, wrote about the similarities between the Switzer and Cuban cases in 2008. He pointed out that Switzer\u2019s victory 30 years ago may have affected the SEC\u2019s investigation into Cuban.\n\u201cIf you overhear a private conversation in an elevator, on an airplane, or even sunbathing, you are free to trade away,\u201d Foster said.\nLegal experts, including Foster, are quick to point out that there are some key differences in the Cuban and Switzer cases.\n\u201cThe SEC didn\u2019t have Switzer\u2019s email or blog postings and it didn\u2019t have a company official claiming Switzer acknowledged he was receiving insider information,\u201d said Arnold Spencer, a former federal prosecutor and now a lawyer at Akin Gump in Dallas.\nSpencer is referring to the video recorded deposition of former Mamma.com CEO Guy Faur\u00e9, who claims that he told Cuban the information about the private stock offering was confidential and that Cuban agreed he could not trade based on the information \u2014 testimony that Cuban strongly denies.", "PANAMA CITY \ufffd Bay County\ufffds residential building market has been on an uptick for the last two years.\nIn 2012 and 2013, the number of single-family home permits the Bay County Building Department issued more than doubled the number issued each year in 2009, 2010 and 2011.\nThe Bay County Building Department issues permits for new construction in the unincorporated county areas and also in Panama City.\n\ufffdIt\ufffds pretty much broad spread over the county as far as building, in the rural areas especially,\ufffd said Carnley, noting high activity in subdivisions like Wild Heron on the west end of the beach, Lake Merial off State 77 and Magnolia Hills near Transmitter Road.\nThe jump began in 2012, when the county issued 267 residential home permits, more than double the 130 permits issued in 2011. Both 2009 and 2010 were slow years due to a depressed economy, with 132 and 121 permits issued, respectively.\nThis year, however, the department already has issued 261 permits, and Carnley said he expects to reach 280 by the end of this year. The increase in residential building also has been good for the county\ufffds pocketbook, with officials expecting $445,000 in permit and impact fees to be collected this year.\nBy comparison, the county collected about $408,000 in fees last year, up from just $152,000 in 2011.\nIt\ufffds a similar situation in Panama City Beach, where building official Ken Thorndyke said things have also been improving on the residential side.\nDuring the 2012-2013 fiscal year, which ended in September, the city permitted 93 new single-family dwellings, double the 46 permits the city distributed two years before and seven times more than the mere 13 permits issued during the 2009-2010 fiscal year.\nThe 2011-2012 fiscal year was also a good one for residential building in Panama City Beach, with 88 permits.\n\ufffdThat\ufffds a significant change from 13 to 93,\ufffd said Thorndyke, who noted city building officials are now reviewing plans on a steady basis.\nThorndyke said Breakfast Point, a planned development off Back Beach Road, will soon kick off a new phase, but for the first time in a long time the city is seeing growth in areas outside the St. Joe Company neighborhood.\n\ufffdBreakfast Point was the main place for quite awhile, but now we\ufffdre seeing some independent builders in some of these other neighborhoods,\ufffd said Thorndyke, citing several new builds in Colony Club and Tapestry Park.\nIn the beach\ufffds multifamily sector, a 38-building, 266-unit apartment complex called \ufffdEdgewater Crossings\ufffd is also under development on Clarence Street.

Its embassy in Sweden has not made public remarks.\nStill no comment from Russia, beyond those remarks by Peskov, at noon on Thursday in the United States.\nVideo footage that appears to show the suspect led out of a restaurant by 'S\u00e4po' (Sakerhetspolisen) officers is circulating on Swedish media, as the BBC reported.\nA witness quoted by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet said several officers of the Swedish security police, known as Sapo, stormed the restaurant and surrounded a table where two people were sitting having a meal.\nSwedish media said a second person was also detained in the operation but later released after claiming diplomatic immunity.\nHere is the Swedish government's news release about the arrest of the suspected Russian agent.\nAn individual has been arrested on suspicion of having carried out unlawful intelligence activities against Sweden. A criminal investigation into this matter, headed by a national security prosecutor, is being run by the Security Service.\nThe individual in question was arrested with the assistance of the Swedish Police in the evening of 26 February 2019 during a meeting in central Stockholm.\n\u201cThis individual is suspected of having been recruited as an agent by a Russian intelligence officer who was working under diplomatic cover in Sweden,\" explains Daniel Stenling, Head of Counter-Intelligence at the Swedish Security Service.\nThe Service has been carrying out intensive intelligence and investigative work in this matter for a long time: it is suspected that the criminal activities have been going on since 2017.\nThe arrested individual was working in a high-technology sector in Sweden on tasks known by our Service to be the type of intelligence sought after by foreign powers.\n\u201cThe threat to Sweden is greater than it has been for several years. Technological developments have made state actors\u2019 efforts to gather intelligence in cyberspace more sophisticated. At the same time, the more traditional intelligence-gathering approach, using recruited agents to collect information, is still being used. This combination enables state actors to broaden and deepen their collection of classified information,\u201d says Daniel Stenling.", "Jeff Jahn is the founder of DynamiX, an award-winning website development company.\nEntrepreneurs live to bend the rules. It\u2019s not malicious, we just see the world a bit differently.\nI was fired from my first job, working as a member of the IT staff at my high school, shortly after starting. While most would simply accept it and move on, I didn't. Instead, I called a meeting with the school headmaster, stated my case, and was rehired with a 100% raise. This taught me that simply accepting what is given to you isn't always the way to go.\nFour years later, as a sophomore in college, I started my first business. By senior year I had my first full-time employee while taking an 18-hour class load and working full time. We had only $2,500 in the bank and couldn't afford to \"take it easy.\"\nI worked during classes, left for meetings, skipped class and missed exams. It was incredibly difficult, but that time taught me the value of being cautious about who you take on as a client, because a poor fit could mean the end of a fledgling business for busy founders.\nIn the early days, we decided to take on a prospect despite having reservations about working with them. By ignoring these instincts, we found ourselves working with someone who didn't care about our business being able to finish his work, just how much he could get out of us. For example, in the middle of building the website, he decided that he wanted a second website for free. When I let him know that wasn\u2019t in our discussions or agreement, he replied, \u201cWell, the way I see it you\u2019re a young kid, and I can sue you. Would you rather be sued or build a second site for free?\u201d We built the site, and I learned to trust my gut.\nFast forward 11 years, and I still take that lesson with me into every prospective client meeting. Rather than seeing every potential sale as a \"must-have,\" we instead treat the meeting as if we are looking to hire a new person. They have to check the boxes for us in being a good, honest company that is genuinely interested in succeeding the right way. They have to recognize the value in our work and be willing to let us bring our creativity to bear in helping them. If any of those criteria aren't met, we'll refer them to another developer for the project.\nIf they check the right boxes, we then ask the question: \"Is this the best opportunity possible given the limited time we have available?\" Under these filters, we have turned down approximately 75% of the companies who come to us for a redesign.\nOn the surface, that might seem completely crazy, but consider the costs that have come from clients you took on who weren't a fit. The amount of emotional energy trying to satiate a client who would never be happy, the time spent doing things you knew weren't in their best interests because they didn't trust you to guide them -- these are real costs that cannot be understated. Now consider the power you have to prevent those situations from happening in the first place.\nI won't claim we're always 100% accurate on this, but making the decision to actively avoid those situations wherever possible has allowed us to grow into an awarded and recognized company in our space, while creating work that our entire team can be proud of.\nThere's no shame in turning away business, because no matter who you are or what you do, the fact is that you won't be the best fit for everyone. Recognize and embrace that fact the next time you take a sales meeting. Instead of making it about why you need the business, make it about what makes that organization special and whether they are going to be a true fit for what you can do for them. If so, you'll knock it out of the park. If not, have the courage to send that business to someone who you know will do it better based on their needs.", "The 17-year-old has scored 14 goals for the Cottagers this season.\nEngland Under-21 boss Aidy Boothroyd insists the Three Lions must learn the lessons of fast-tracking young stars too soon.\nRyan Sessegnon, the 17-year-old Fulham star, is with the Young Lions for the first time for games against Romania and Ukraine, having been considered for the senior side.\nSessegnon has scored 14 goals for Fulham this season as they challenge for promotion in the Sky Bet Championship having previously played for the England Under-19s.\nSenior boss Gareth Southgate name-checked him last week, leading to comparisons with Theo Walcott\u2019s surprise call for the 2006 World Cup at just 17.\nAnd, accepting the similarity, Boothroyd will not rush his new star.\nHe said: \u201cYes and we have to learn those lessons.

Two people talking to each other might play in primetime, but unless somebody\u2019s going to pick up a banana and hit the two guys talking over the head with it, it doesn\u2019t work for my audience. And I\u2019m not just talking about an onslaught of spit takes, although our demographic never grows tired of that. In our episode submission \u201cZeke\u2019s Last Ride,\u201d we tell a simple story about how Zeke copes with a career-threatening injury, and how his best friend Luther drives him nuts trying to be his nursemaid. Along the way we send our leads flying off 30-foot ramps. We\u2019re not a stage-bound sitcom, and our audience likes the difference. Maybe the academy will recognize that difference, too.\nDEADLINE: This is the show\u2019s final season. Why is a successful show going off the air?\nDEARBORN: It\u2019s pretty common for kids\u2019 shows. The stars grow out of it. Hutch Dano and Adam Hicks are now over six feet tall.\nDEADLINE: How did you get into the TV business?\nDEARBORN: I grew up in Marin County, and I always had low expectations for myself. At my high school graduation they were asking us to fill out where we hoped to be in 10 years, and everybody wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer, but I wanted to be a doorman at a hotel. I was attracted to the simplicity and the commerce that surrounded being a doorman at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel: you wear a great uniform, you open the door for somebody, and they hand you a buck. But, when I was a kid, I had an obsession with standup comics \u2014 but secretly. I never told anyone. In the mid-1980s, I was driving prop trucks for a lot of Los Angeles commercial and music videos and worked my way up; I was an art director for half adozen music videos. I met Karl Schaefer, a USC film school grad, who hired me to drive a camera truck on a low-budget movie, and out of the blue he said, \u2018You should be a writer.\u2019 Then when he later got a show on CBS, he had me write some audition scenes when they were casting their pilot and he put me on staff. It was a very quick way to jump into the world of writing.\nDEADLINE: How did you learn how to write TV scripts?\nDEARBORN: While I was still driving trucks, I got Syd Field\u2019s The Foundations of Screenwriting. As a craftsman, I understood that a screenplay would have a structure to it. One time I was driving a truck to Boise, and I sent my first script to The New Alfred Hitchcock Presents in 1986. I was thinking what was the worst revenge you could exact on somebody, and I thought of a woman who tattoos a murder confession on a guy\u2019s face. I called the secretary of the production company and she said: \u2018We don\u2019t take submissions.\u2019 But I just begged her to read it, and she liked it enough to pass it on to her boss. But I still didn\u2019t understand the realities of the budget, stuff like that. It didn\u2019t occur to me why it wasn\u2019t good to do a helicopter shot on the Paris skyline.\nDEADLINE: What happened after that?\nDEARBORN: I started working hour dramas, teen dramas \u2014 TV 101, Beverly Hills 90210, The Heights. Then, in 1995, I got asked to work on the Nickelodeon series The Secret World of Alex Mack. Then Even Stevens, and I am one of the 37 people who take credit for launching Shia LeBoeuf. He would have made it to the top anyway.\nDEADLINE: You write for kids\u2019 shows. Do you have kids?\nDEARBORN: I was a single dad: I raised my daughter in Los Angeles from about second grade through high school. Now she\u2019s got a kid of her own. But I also have a kid\u2019s sensibility. It\u2019s who I am \u2014 spilling stuff, falling.\nDEADLINE: Does it help you write the shows?\nDEARBORN: In Zeke & Luther we have no parents \u2014 you don\u2019t see them, you don\u2019t hear about them. We are trying to re-create a childhood that\u2019s about being outside, and making your own rules, as opposed to a parent walking in and asking if your room is clean and your homework done. We don\u2019t have any of that stuff. We don\u2019t have a high school principal or teacher. Usually you need those parental fi gures to relay the stakes in a story. We let the boys fi nd the stakes themselves.\nDEADLINE: Do you trust your instincts about what kids want to see, or do you research?\nDEARBORN: We just figured it out. Disney is big on testing. And when you are watching those test audiences, every time the kid gets clotheslined by that real estate sign, they sit up and grin. You get into a two-page dialogue scene, and they\u2019re fidgeting. Boys need to see things fall down, they need to see people get hurt (but not too hurt), they need goo, they need sort of raunchier humor. Girls have a little more patience in the broadest general sense. They like to listen to witty banter, and they like to hear about the relationships. That\u2019s why our scenes are only a page at the most, and that\u2019s why something hits the floor every scene.\nDEADLINE: What\u2019s it like doing a kids\u2019 show for Disney?\nDEARBORN: I would say they are very involved, they are very particular. But it\u2019s their deal, you know? I\u2019ve worked worse places, for sure. These executives that I\u2019m working with, I find that they think like writers for the most part. When they have a story problem, they\u2019re not wrong. They can usually sniff it out.\nDEADLINE: Are you and Tom equal partners in running the show?\nDEARBORN: He\u2019s the funniest writer I\u2019ve ever met. We have very similar sensibilities, just in terms of our absurdist view of childhood. The success of Zeke & Luther is equally shared between me and Tom. We are not a team; we are two guys who were teamed together for this show. I\u2019ve run four other shows. If you keep doing a good job and you get old enough and you don\u2019t move out of town, eventually they\u2019ll ask you to run a show.\nDEADLINE: What\u2019s your favorite TV?\nDEARBORN: I like Mad Men; and I like Lockup Raw, a reality show; and I like Family Guy; and I sample everything.", "HuffPost reported Monday that a customer smashed the window of the historic LGBTQ bar the Stonewall Inn, damaging the bar\u2019s iconic sign.\nAccording to the New York City Police Department, 19-year-old William Gomez smashed the establishment\u2019s window with a baseball bat after arguing with a bouncer on early Saturday morning. Gomez was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, criminal mischief, and reckless endangerment.\nAfter leaving the bar, Gomez returned shortly afterwards with a baseball bat and and proceeded to smash the bar\u2019s iconic window, punching holes into the glass and damaging the red neon sign. Gomez\u2019s outburst caused $6,800 worth of damages. Luckily, the window and sign were hastily repaired before the bar officially opened later that same day.\nGomez\u2019s mother came to his defense, telling reporters that her son is generally a quiet boy and claimed that the bouncer was \u201cmessing with one of his co-workers\u201d and had punched Gomez in the face before he had returned to smash the bar\u2019s window with a baseball bat. His mother also told the New York Daily News that her son isn\u2019t gay and is expecting a child with his girlfriend.\nPolice records indicate that Gomez was previously charged with assault in 2017 and had been arrested several other times.\nThe Stonewall Inn, which was recently declared a national monument in 2016, is the site of the historic Stonewall Riots, which occurred on June 28, 1969, lasting for six days. The riots are now widely considered the birth of the LGBTQ rights movement in the United States.\nGomez is not being charged with a hate crime.", "Lack of professionalism and the right skills among the UK's IT workers means that billions of pounds are wasted every year on new IT systems, according to a report by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the British Computer Society.\nIn a scathing assessment of the industry, the report, The Challenges of Complex IT Projects, claims that universities are failing to produce software engineers and managers with the necessary skills to commission and execute complex IT projects.\nThe report reckons that the UK public sector has spent an estimated \u00a312.4bn on software in the last year, while the overall UK spend on IT is projected to be an eye-watering \u00a322.6bn.\n\"We looked at a range of studies showing that only around 16 per cent of IT projects can be considered truly successful. Even conservative estimates put the cost of such failures into tens of billions of pounds across the EU,\" said Basil Butler, chairman of the working group that produced the report.\nThe most stinging criticism came from Professor John McDermid, Professor of Software Engineering at the University of York and a member of the working group that helped produce the report.\n\"It is time for the IT industry to recognise the engineering content of their work and to embrace the discipline and professionalism associated with traditional branches of engineering,\" says Professor McDermid.\n\"In fact, there is a powerful argument that registration should be mandatory for people working on high-consequence systems like safety-critical or banking software. We think the Office of Government Commerce should consider this.\"\nHe went on: \"It is a cardinal mistake to select suppliers for a complex IT project on the basis of price alone, since it is very difficult for suppliers to accurately predict costs at the outset. If a customer is asking for something unrealistic or ultra-high risk, the supplier should tell the customer and encourage them to review the project.\n\"Projects are often poorly defined, codes of practice are frequently ignored and there is a woeful inability to learn from past experience.\n\"The role of systems architects is critical - their job is to translate a business vision into a technical blueprint. They often hold the keys to success in complex IT projects but they are in very short supply.", "Over the years, many innovative products have been misinterpreted as \u201cdisruptive.\u201d No technology \u2013 no matter how innovative \u2013 is inherently disruptive. Google Search is a classic example of an innovative product that only truly became disruptive after a smart business model was introduced (AdWords).\nSimilarly, iPod and iPhone were both well-designed products, but only became disruptive due to the creation of iTunes and the App Store, respectively.\nThe recent acquisition of Metaio by Apple highlights another example: an innovative product based on Augmented Reality/Image Recognition (AR/IR) technology that couldn\u2019t become disruptive.\nOn one hand, we can see Apple\u2019s move as validation for the potential of a technology that, thus far, has struggled to gain traction with mainstream audiences. With the launch of Apple Watch and, now, the Metaio acquisition, Apple can be added to a growing list of the world\u2019s most influential companies who are quickly expanding with significant investments in wearables, AR/IR and virtual reality (VR) products.\nWhile many made similar statements around Google Glass as a sign of the industry\u2019s arrival, it\u2019s hard not to view Apple\u2019s involvement as proof that the wearables era will finally go truly mainstream.\nYet, the acquisition also highlights a sad fact about the industry and its slow growth to-date. While seemingly a win for both Metaio and Apple, the deal will likely deliver nowhere near the full potential value Metaio investors may have expected years ago.\nMetaio holds a tremendous amount of IP; content which is unlikely to be reflected in the purchase price. Nor should it, to be fair.\nThe reality is that Metaio followed the path of many other classic technology companies and focused on products rather than creating a sustainable business model to build long-term consumer behavior.\nIn taking the buyout, Metaio is somewhat acknowledging that it hasn\u2019t identified a way to deliver on the potential of its range of content.\nStrategically, this isn\u2019t a bad move for either company. In fact, it\u2019s a good one. Apple gets proven software and an established customer base to kick start its AR wearables efforts, while Metaio gets a nice exit and joins a team with a stellar reputation for innovation.\nSo while not a bad business decision, it\u2019s still disappointing to see a low appetite for risk from an emerging industry that has such strong potential for growth and disruption. This space is exploding, with many predicting that AR, IR and VR technologies will drive a transformation not seen since the introduction of mobile.\nAnd yet, despite all of the recent industry activity, it\u2019s still a pretty nascent market as companies develop new strategies that will forever change how we consume and engage with content.\nAs we stand on the cusp of a new stage in how consumers will interact with the world around them, it\u2019s important to remember the distinction between an innovative product and a disruptive business model.\nIt\u2019s easy to point to Google Glass as an example of a situation in which the scope of the technology outpaced the demand for it. That doesn\u2019t mean that it was a failure. Rather, it means Google learned a lot from user feedback and will come back stronger as a result.\nIn any quickly growing market, the industry\u2019s ability to innovate new technologies is exponentially faster than its ability to identify valuable utility for the end user. Identifying a business model that provides strong value to its customers and allows the business to scale is a challenge every company faces. The process requires strong leadership and patience from investors.\nFinding the right business model to match an innovative product is difficult. But the entrepreneurs that are willing to tackle this challenge and iterate, pivot and optimize their model will become the leaders that determine the future of the AR/VR market.\nWhile behemoths like Apple will continue to play a tremendous role in driving the market forward, there\u2019s plenty of room for a company with a foothold today to become the next Facebook, Uber or Snapchat.\nSelling a treasure chest of IP-related to AR now is analogous to being back in the 1990s -- and selling keys to the Internet.", "Feb. 23, 2018 11:26 p.m.\nKelly makes an excellent that being small does not make everyone happy.

If people aren't buying guns, manufacturers can't profit, and their stocks will tank.\nWhile there is indeed a slowdown under way and the stocks of gunmakers have borne the brunt of it, the industry is inherently cyclical and the current downtrend is nowhere near as apocalyptic as has been portrayed. The industry still offers several attractive investment opportunities, made even more so because of the hits their stocks have taken, but also because of their strong management teams and otherwise great operations.\nLet's take a look at three of the top publicly traded gun companies: American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ:AOBC), Sturm, Ruger (NYSE:RGR), and Olin (NYSE:OLN).\nUntil this year it was known as Smith & Wesson Holding, but American Outdoor Brands still produces the storied firearm under its well-known and respected brand name, and with good reason: Smith & Wesson is the biggest firearms brand in the country and has the greatest name recognition of any firearms on the market. One of every two revolvers owned in the U.S. is a Smith & Wesson. That's something you don't want to mess with.\nCEO James Debny has remarked the slowdown everyone is talking about is really just a normalization trend. The past year or so of outsize gun sales is the anomaly; the new pace the industry is setting is more in line with historical patterns, and that still means growth. Not in comparison with 2016, perhaps, and maybe not even 2015, which was also a banner year, but overall the trends of gun ownership and sales are rising.\nYet American Outdoor Brands also represents a play on the growing and much larger rugged outdoors market that closely parallels the shooting-sports industry, one it's targeting through acquisitions. It made three last year, and investors can expect more to come. There's also the promise of a \"transformative\" acquisition being made, though in what area still remains a question mark.\nThe gunmaker remains financially sound and still produces exceptional amounts of free cash flow, which over the trailing 12 months totaled $168 million. With an enterprise value of $1.17 billion, American Outdoor Brands is trading at less than seven time its free cash flow, making its stock exceedingly discounted. It also trades at eight times earnings and 11 times next year's estimates, and when you factor in analyst long-term earnings growth forecasts, the stock goes off at just a fraction of what they're predicting. This gunmaker's stock is cheap, and buying in ahead of the next upturn in the cycle will richly reward investors.\nSturm, Ruger has many of the same superlatives attached to it as industry peer Smith & Wesson. A well-known and respected brand, it also happens to be the biggest gunmaker in the country. Not only does it produce pistols and revolvers, but its rifles earn high marks and its 10/22 in .22LR rimfire is one of the most ubiquitous, dependable rifles on the market.\nRifles also account for the majority of its revenues, or $265 million in 2016, more than pistols ($250 million), or revolvers ($105 million). That it also produces three times as many rifles as does Smith & Wesson bodes well as gun sales have begun moving away from handguns and toward long guns, something American Outdoor's Debny acknowledged in his most recent earnings conference call with analysts, saying the switch caught him by surprise.\nMany of those rifles being purchased are probably modern sporting rifles, typically (but incorrectly) called \"assault rifles,\" and Ruger's AR-556 has been an extremely popular model since it was introduced a little over two years ago, helping to push the gunmaker's revenue to new highs.\nRuger is an even more financially sound gunmaker than its rival as it has no debt. While its stock is not as discounted as American Outdoor Brands, it still trades at a low 11 times earnings, and its enterprise value is a discounted 13 times its free cash flow.\nShares of the gunmaker enjoyed a run up over the past few weeks, as it stock became heavily shorted, but with its strong financial footing, it should handily survive the reported industry weakness and come out fine when the rebound occurs.\nNot a gun manufacturer, Olin makes ammunition, and its Winchester brand accounts for 13% of its total $5.5 billion in sales. Obviously, if people are buying fewer guns they'll also be buying less ammunition, and CEO John Fischer said last month he's witnessed an ammo slowdown, too, as dealers overbought in anticipation of a different outcome in the November elections and leaving themselves with excess inventory on hand. But that's not the whole story.\nThe boom in the gun business increased not just the supply of firearms in the market, but also the number of shooters coming to the sport. Recent National Shooting Sports Foundation data shows women are the fastest growing demographic in the sport, and between 2009 and 2014, 17 million new target shooters were brought in, a 50% gain. Furthermore, new shooters are younger, with 68% of new shooters between the ages of 18 and 34 compared to 31% of established shooters, meaning the industry will benefit from them for years to come.\nWhat this means for Olin and other ammo makers is there will be continued demand for ammunition even if gun sales don't grow. Citing NSSF data, Winchester recently noted that women shooters in particular \"hit a range for target practice at least once a month\" and it quotes economic research firm Southwick Associates as saying \"nearly half of all active target shooters introduce a newcomer to the range or field each year.\"\nJust because you're not buying a gun doesn't mean you're not brushing up on your shooting skills, and that will take ammo to do so. Certainly there may be an excess of inventory at the moment, but once that's worked through sales should pick up again.\nIt should be noted that Olin isn't just an ammo maker, but also a specialty chemicals company too, which holds favorable trends as well. Olin's stock has doubled over the past year and is up 27% so far in 2017, but there's good reason to believe Olin will continue to rise going forward too.", "Yesterday, your Daddy, Nanny Courtney and I took you to your two-month doctor\u2019s appointment. We had mixed emotions heading into the appointment, as people kept asking us how much you weighed and how tall you were, but we don\u2019t have an infant scale at home so we had to wait until the official weigh-in to find out. It was also at the appointment when you would receive your first vaccinations.\nWhen we scheduled our appointment, we asked for the first appointment of the day so that we wouldn\u2019t have to wait as long as we did the first time. The office staff was so apologetic to us last time and gave us all the \u201cinsider\u201d tips on how to schedule the appointments, etc. It worked, as we were only there a few minutes before we were called back to the exam room. We all entered with trepidation, knowing what was going to happen at some point during our time there. Daddy kept trying to deflect his anxiety about it by jokingly asking when the \u201cstabbings\u201d were going to take place. Of course, they didn\u2019t happen until the very end so we had to agonize with anticipation until that point.\nFirst, we had to strip you down and have you weighed. The nurse said that you were \u201cvery healthy\u201d and made a guess at how much she thought you would weigh. According to the averages, her guess would have definitely made you a \u201cvery healthy\u201d weight [meaning above average]. Daddy kiddingly scolded the nurse for calling you fat, which she never really did. When I put you on the scale, the nurse was within one ounce of being correct. You weighed in at 13 pounds, one ounce. We just had lunch the other day with a mom and one of your future boyfriends who is a couple months ahead of you. He weighed in at 14 pounds\u2014at his four month appointment. As soon as the doctor came in the room, Daddy said, \u201cWe have lots of stupid questions.\u201d One of the reasons we love your pediatrician is because she never makes us feel like our questions are stupid. \u201cMy first question is she overweight,\u201d said Daddy. The doctor quickly said, \u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d You see, you measured at 24 inches, which is also very tall for your age. You were at the 88 percentile for weight but the 95 percentile for height so you are perfectly proportioned, including the circumference of your head\u2014which I don\u2019t know what the average is there.\nWe were relieved to know that we weren\u2019t overfeeding you, and she explained that we should continue to let you eat as much as you seem to want to eat. We then moved through all of our questions, and she calmly explained everything to us. Then, we had the vaccination-related questions. Other friends had talked to us about the reports of an increase in autism in children and the thought that vaccinations might in some way be related. The pediatrician could not have put us more at ease. As she explained it to us, the vaccinations in the \u201cstudy\u201d were the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) shots. Those are given to children when they are one-year old, not the vaccinations given at two, four and six months. She also told us that the \u201cstudy\u201d come out many years ago and has since been found to have been erroneous, the results were retracted and the doctor who published the study had his medical license revoked. As your doctor put it, \u201cthere is no logical reason why you wouldn\u2019t follow the guidelines of the recommended vaccination schedule.\u201d She also explained the approval process that the companies that produce the vaccinations must go through to have them added to the schedule. It is extremely rigorous and thorough. The last thing a company would want is to have something go wrong with a product that is being given to every child in the country. Additionally, in those foreign countries and pockets of the U.S. where there has been an increase in the number of parents rejecting the MMR vaccine, there has been an increase in the number of cases of those diseases, which puts babies in harm\u2019s way. All of this made us feel much better about the decision we made.\nSome friends also told us to make sure to give you some liquid acetaminophen before or after the shots. We asked the doctor about that, and she said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to help with the pain of the injection. Have you ever known Tylenol to work THAT well? It isn\u2019t a narcotic.\u201d She also said that about 85 percent of children have no reaction to the vaccinations so we should wait to see if you needed the medicine before we gave it to you. Again, that\u2019s one of the reasons we like her; she is very conservative in her treatment.\nBy the end of the appointment, you had your vaccinations, and yes, you cried for about one minute. Daddy has a phobia of needles and didn\u2019t want to let on to you that he was scared/worried so he didn\u2019t watch. I wanted to make sure you didn\u2019t feel alone so I wanted to hold you while they gave you the shots. I don\u2019t know if it made you feel better, but it made me feel like I was at least comforting you. By the time we had all of your stuff packed back up in the diaper bag and walked out of the exam room, you were asleep and the happy baby that we know and love. You might have been measured as a \u201cbig baby,\u201d but I think your Daddy and I were the bigger babies in the room.\nEvery parent has to make the choice that is right for them and their children, but we felt much more comfortable making an informed decision after some research and speaking with your doctor. I\u2019m not looking forward to your four-month doctor\u2019s visit, but I at least feel better about knowing we are doing what we feel is right for our family.\nDo you have your children vaccinated?\nIf so, do you follow the regular bundled two-, four- and six-month schedule?", "ENGLAND need to copy the Germans if we are going to win the World Cup again.\nI can\u2019t quite believe I have said that, but it is about time this country faced some home truths.\nWe need to rip up this England team and start all over again.\nEven if we don\u2019t qualify for Euro 2012 in Poland and the Ukraine, it would be worth it if we can galvanise our squad and breathe new life into it.\nWe need to blood some new players and get rid of the dead wood. And that includes Fabio Capello, who is pathetic for not having already quit as boss.\nIf I had been England manager, we would have got through that group and still reached the last 16. Any manager in the country could have done it.\nWhen we finally faced a good team in Germany, they battered us, absolutely destroyed us. It was embarrassing.\nBack in 2000, Germany failed to escape from their group in the European \u00adChampionships and England beat them 1-0 in one of the group games.\nWe then went on to rip them to shreds 5-1 a year later in Munich, with the team you watched eat us alive last Sunday coming about after that humiliation.\nGermany backed their young players, \u00adgiving them the chance to flourish, and they now have a team which is in the quarter-finals of this World Cup, when in fact their real target is four years away in Brazil.\nEngland have to copy Germany\u2019s blueprint. Players like Adam Johnson, Jack Rodwell at Everton and Arsenal\u2019s Jack Wilshere have to be given a chance.\nJohnson was only played for six \u00adminutes in the two friendlies before this tournament, which was criminal.\nHe is first choice at Manchester City in front of Shaun Wright-Phillips, yet did not go to the World Cup.\nThis England team has had it and needs to be dismantled.\nIf a player in his prime like Joe Cole can\u2019t get into the side, then he might as well pack it in and forget about \u00adinternational football.\nI like Joe, but there is no longer any future for him with England after this tournament.\nThe FA have been paying Capello \u00adalmost \u00a36m a season, yet he got so many things wrong.\nIt is clear to everybody that 4-4-2 is completely outdated. We looked \u00adprehistoric in the way that we tried to play the game, which is just mad.\nPeter Crouch was scoring goals for fun going into the tournament, including two against Mexico, and was hardly used.\nYou then have the greatest scoring midfielder in Europe in the side and you don\u2019t allow him to go forward. Frank Lampard will probably get \u00adanother 25 goals for Chelsea next \u00adseason, and people will ask why he can\u2019t do it for England.\nWell, he was never \u00adgiven the chance under Capello.\nDarren Bent scored more than 20 goals for Sunderland, yet we stuck with Emile \u00adHeskey who can\u2019t buy a goal.\nAnd it is now quite clear that Rob Green should never have been in goal in the first place.\nCapello ended up an \u00adembarrassment and the players were clearly afraid of him by the end with the amount of screaming and shouting that he did.\nI would have Harry Redknapp as \u00adEngland manager all day long.\nHe would be perfect. For starters he is English.\nThe FA make coaches and managers spend a lot of time and money on \u00adgetting the right badges to work in the game in this country \u2013 and then they con them by giving the England \u00admanager\u2019s job to a foreigner.\nIt is just wrong. Capello has been hailed for getting England to the World Cup, but that should have been a given.\nThe only reason that was deemed a success was because of the disaster that Steve McClaren had in qualifying for Euro 2008.\nMcClaren was too raw to be England boss, but Redknapp is perfect.\nHe is the most wonderful \u00adman-manager I have known.\nI played for him at Portsmouth and he just says, \u2018Go out and enjoy yourself\u2019.\nHe wants footballers to express \u00adthemselves on the pitch. Every player in the world gives possession away, but there is no point doing your nut about it.\nAs a manager you have to get players wanting to perform for you, which is what Harry does.\nPeople talk about stuff \u00adgoing on off the pitch, but look at Diego Maradona. He has had a colourful life and been in and out of drug clinics, but what he gives the \u00adArgentina \u00adplayers is priceless.\nRedknapp would be the \u00adperfect \u00adinspiration for any England player. So, give him the job and allow him to start again.", "In a major development that was seen as an attempt to resurrect the Indo-Pak ties, the Imran Khan government in Islamabad decided to invite Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the South Asian Association Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit.\nThe announcement drew mixed reactions in India with some seeing it as a \u2018ploy\u2019 and some looking it as a window of opportunity to open a new chapter in their bilateral relations.\nPakistan Foreign Office Spokesman Mohammad Faisal announced it on Tuesday, as reported by The Dawn. The announcement followed Imran Khan's previous letter to PM Modi earlier this year that talked about constructive engagement between India and Pakistan and invited him to Pakistan.\nImran Khan wrote the letter on September 14, a month after he was sworn-in as the new Prime Minister of Pakistan. Khan was responding to the greetings sent by PM Modi on his election victory.\nThe previous letter talked about constructive engagement and said Pakistan had shown the spirit to talk by sending Pakistan's Minister of Law and Information to the funeral of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\nThe letter further highlighted how Vajpayee worked to better India-Pakistan relations and wanted a stronger SAARC.\nHowever, soon after the letter was sent, relations between the two sides fell off again, when stamps were issued in Pakistan in memory of the slain Kashmiri militant commander, which enraged New Delhi and led to war of words between the two sides.\nLast week, Pakistan government made an effort to repair relations by inviting India's foreign minister for the Kartarpur corridor inauguration ceremony. India confirmed that two ministers would be attending the event, which signaled a thaw in their relations.\nThe invitation by Pakistan to PM Modi for participation in SAARC Summit could have paved the ground for resurrection of ties between two neighbors. But, that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening for now.\nOn Wednesday, India put to rest any speculation over Modi travelling to Pakistan to attend the SAARC Summit.\nAddressing media, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj categorically stated that there was no way PM Modi would travel to Pakistan for the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) regional grouping.\nThe minister said no dialogue can take place between India and Pakistan till the time the latter puts a curb on terrorist activities emanating from its soil. \u201cPM Narendra Modi will not go to Pakistan to attend the SAARC Summit,\u201d she declared.\n\u201cFor many years, the Indian government has been asking for this (Kartarpur) corridor, only now Pakistan responded positively. It doesn\u2019t mean the bilateral dialogue will start because of this, terror and talks can\u2019t go together,\u201d Swaraj said.\nPertinently in 2016, India and several other nations had pulled out of the SAARC Summit in Pakistan citing the unfavorable regional security situation and for India, specifically the issue was about cross-border terrorism.", "Starcraft is being used to teach resource management skills in a new course offering at the University of Florida - but it's only open to students in the honors college, and students have to have some familiarity with the game.\nNate Poling, a Ph.D candidate at UF, came up with the idea and sold his department on it, so IDS 2935 \"21st Century Skills in Starcraft,\" will be offered as an online-only class this coming semester.\nStarcraft as a college subject isn't new; California-Berkeley offered a course on competitive Starcraft through its renowned Haas School of Business. At Florida, it sounds like Poling's lesson plan will also align Starcraft to business management.\nThose who run businesses, factories and hospitals must manage according to their knowledge of their personnel's strengths, weaknesses and different abilities, sort of the same calculus involved in StarCraft.\n\"A student who gets a normal education, gets an MBA, and is in the business world, he could realize that something he learned in his StarCraft course helps him think outside of the box,\" Poling told MIT's Technology Review. \"You synthesize this with an MBA program and voila - you have an innovative business practice.\"\nHe's careful to stress this is a supplemental course, not a replacement for traditional teaching methods. Poling anticipates it'll be a popular offering, but the StarCraft skillz and honors-only requisites should keep him from getting swamped by students wanting to play games for a grade.\nThere is no final examination, but the course does count toward undergrads' GPA.", "Making computers, software and the internet more accessible to users who have physical handicaps is the goal of Microsoft's two Accessibility Insights applications, which are now available as open source code.\nThe two free tools, Accessibility Insights for Windows and Accessibility Insights for Web, help developers find and fix common accessibility issues early in the software development cycle. They can be used as stand-alone tools or can be integrated through their rules engines into a developer's build process, Keith Ballinger, a developer services general manager with Microsoft, wrote in a March 12 post on the company's Open Source Blog.\n\"We're on a journey to design, build and launch more accessible products to foster inclusion\" for users with a wide range of physical disabilities, wrote Ballinger. \"That's why we created Accessibility Insights, a first step in developing tools that help developers address accessibility issues early in the design process. Our aim with Accessibility Insights is not to reinvent the wheel, but to modernize existing technology and optimize it for use in developer workflows.\"\nThe applications are built on open-source axe technology from Deque Systems, which works with companies to make their websites and mobile apps accessible to people with disabilities, wrote Ballinger. The Accessibility Insights applications are part of Microsoft's larger inclusion efforts that also involve inclusive hiring and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Trusted Tester program, he added.\n\"We are driven by the promise of more accessible products for more people,\" wrote Ballinger. \"That's why we\u2019re releasing Accessibility Insights to the open source and accessibility communities\u2014it's all of ours now, and together we'll continue to make it a better tool and build a more accessible future.\"\nTo foster the new open-source efforts, Deque Systems is providing GitHub issue filing for Accessibility Insights for Web and color contrast detection heuristics for Accessibility Insights for Windows, wrote Ballinger. Microsoft contributed its Windows rules engine to the axe accessibility project so all major platforms could be covered.\nUsing automated checking systems, Accessibility Insights can quickly identify common accessibility issues in a developer's code, enabling them to find code problems before proceeding to additional tests that require human judgment. Those human-powered tests also get assistance from the tools, wrote Ballinger, which helps the tests go more smoothly.\n\"By focusing on easy-to-use tooling, we hope to help make accessibility more accessible,\" wrote Ballinger.\nAfter downloading the code for the two Accessibility Insights tools, developers can join the open-source projects for Windows or for the web on GitHub.\nThe Accessibility Insights for Windows tool includes a Live Inspect feature that allows developers to verify that an element in an app has the right UI Automation properties when hovering over the element or setting keyboard focus on it. In addition, the FastPass feature is a lightweight, two-step process that helps developers identify common, high-impact accessibility issues in less than five minutes.\nTroubleshooting capabilities within the application allow developers to diagnose and fix specific accessibility issues, including viewing the patterns supported by a control and invoking associated user interface methods to see whether an element responds correctly to user input and recording application events to verify that an app is generating the expected events.\nThe Accessibility Insights for Web tool is a Chrome extension that helps developers find and fix accessibility issues in web apps and sites. It includes FastPass to help developers identify common, high-impact accessibility issues quickly and assessment capabilities that allow anyone with HTML skills to verify that a web app or website is 100 percent compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA.\n\"We value the insights of a diverse community to ensure that we build the best tooling in the industry,\" wrote Ballinger. \"Together, with partners, developers, designers, and the disability community, we can ensure equal access to information for everyone.\"", "Britney Spears will not face another trial on charges of driving-without-a-licence after a Los Angeles jury failed to reach a verdict.\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge James A.

There's their new vegan \"how-to\" site, a forthcoming restaurant, and so much more that we've covered over the years.\nDeGeneres went vegan back in 2008 after reading books like \"Skinny B*tch,\" \"Diet for a New America\" and watching documentaries \"Earthlings\" and \"Meet Your Meat.\" In a new interview with the Washington Post, however, the 54-year-old says the transition wasn't easy.\nAs the Washington Post article points out, DeGeneres' switch to veganism was made all-the-more easy by one gigantic addition: a private vegan chef. That reveal makes it a bit harder to sympathize with her \"it was hard\" position, but I credit her and Portia's dedication nonetheless.\nWhich brings us to the point of this interview in the first place. That vegan chef, Roberto Martin, has a new book \"Vegan Cooking for Carnivores,\" featuring some of the recipes he made for Ellen and Portia.\n\u201cThey were over-the-moon happy,\u201d said Martin, who says the key to making the transition easier is creative substitutions for traditional dishes. Portia provided the foreword to his new book, while Ellen contributed an afterword.\n\"Martin uses tofu, beans, faux meat substitutes, vegan mayonnaise, butter and cheese, and milk substitutes like soy and almond to make dishes that will appeal 'to carnivores,'\" writes one reviewer on Amazon. \"He does not include a recipe to make your own seitan \u2014 a basic vegetarian protein \u2014 however.

Time for India to speak the truth about false claims and actual losses on their side including the second aircraft shot down by Pakistan,\" Ghafoor said.\nHis remarks came after a report in US-based Foreign Policy magazine, quoting two senior American defence officials with direct knowledge of the situation, said the US personnel recently counted Pakistan's F-16s and found none of the planes missing.\nAfter the aerial confrontation, India said one of its MiG-21 fighter jets downed a Pakistani F-16 before itself being shot down on February 27. The pilot of that jet Varthaman was captured by Pakistan and handed over to India on March 1 in an effort to de-escalate the crisis.\nPakistan, however, has consistently denied the Indian Air Force's claim, saying none of its aircraft was shot down during the weeks of tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries.\nPakistan also claims to have shot a second Indian Air Force jet during the engagement, a claim India has dismissed.\nTensions between India and Pakistan escalated after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror group killed 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14.\nIndia launched a counter-terror operation against a JeM training camp in Balakot in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.", "All that adds up to a little over $6.6 billion.\nLet's look at sales taxes. Mississippi's general 7 percent sales tax plus other special sales taxes pulled in $3 billion in revenue for the last fiscal year. It's hard to calculate exactly, but upping the general sales tax by 2 percent to 9 percent could pull in an extra $800 million a year.\nSimple arithmetic ($6.6 billion divided by $800 million) says it would take 8.25 years of the extra sales taxes to generate $6.6 billion.\nThe MEC/Blueprint Mississippi report says the Mississippi Department of Transportation already spends an average of $234 million a year on repairs. It wants to count that as a source of funding to catch up on road and bridge repairs. The reality, though, is every year new repairs are needed. For simplicity's sake, let's say the $234 million is needed for ongoing annual repairs and the full $6.6 billion must be generated to restore our road and bridge system.\nSo, dear reader, it would take 8.25 years for a 2 percent general sales tax increase to provide the money needed (not counting inflation).\nHowever, even if the Legislature agreed with you that the sales tax is the fairest tax, it's not going to happen. But your idea was worth a look.\nAnother idea that is not going to happen is for the Legislature to ensure Mississippi gets an economic boost from the lieutenant governor's plan to eliminate business franchise taxes. Rather than just eliminating the tax and hoping that will generate business growth, the Legislature could take a different approach. Giving businesses a franchise tax credit for each new job created (and maintained), with extra credit for hiring unemployed people, would ensure employment growth while offsetting franchise tax liabilities.\nAny more readers have ideas to share?", "Both teams have plenty of offensive firepower.

The initiative is part of a campaign to counter anti-Muslim stereotypes and misinformation in the media.\nLike many Muslims, Asim Khan is tired of the prejudice against his religion.\nThe president of the Islamic Circle of North America New Jersey chapter welcomes curiosity. But he wishes those with questions about Islam would ask him or other Muslims before jumping to conclusions.\n\"Rather than absorb knowledge from Fox News, we invite people to come hear it from the horse\u2019s mouth. We invite them to ask us what our faith is about,\" Khan said. \"There is a lot of curiosity about Islam, but also misinformation, uncertainty, and a sense of fear in approaching us.\"\nAs the 10th anniversary of 9/11 approaches, asking a Muslim about Islam is now as simple as making a phone call. Two 48-foot billboards recently put up on the New Jersey Turnpike tell drivers with questions about the religion to dial (877) 949-47526 \u2014 a 24/7 toll-free hotline sponsored by the Islamic Circle of North America.\nThe New Jersey billboards are among more than 50 going up on highways around the country from El Paso to Daytona, from Wichita to Albuquerque. The ads \u2014 which began appearing on the Aug. 1 start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan \u2014 encourage anyone with questions about Islam to speak to those who experience the faith firsthand.\nFor the next month, northbound drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike near interchange 14E will find a billboard with a U.S. flag and a message: \"877-WhyIslam \u2014 Get the Facts.\" A second sign, near the interchange 16 toll plaza, reads \"Ramadan \u2014 1.57 Billion Celebrating. Find Out Why.\"\nCallers may find themselves on the line with Nahela Morales, a Union City resident and one of eight volunteers answering the phone. Morales, 35, was born in Mexico City, grew up in suburban California and moved to New York two months before 9/11.

The former clerk, Michael Jeanes, held the position since 1999, but retired in March.\nGov. Doug Ducey selected Chris DeRose as the interim clerk until the election.\nDeRose, a Republican, is running in hopes of keeping the seat permanently, but he faces a Republican primary challenger in the Aug. 28 primary. The winner of that race will then face a Democratic challenger in November.\nAlthough the role is administrative in nature, the Arizona Constitution establishes it as an elected position. The Democrat in the race, Roberta Neil Miller, has expressed concerns that her Republican challengers may politicize the office or use it as a stepping stone to a bigger political career. She said she'd like to see the office be nonpartisan.\nDeRose is no stranger to Valley political circles. Most recently, he unsuccessfully ran for Phoenix City Council.\nDeRose previously worked as a prosecutor for the Attorney General's office and a constitutional law professor.\nHe was selected by Ducey to serve as the interim clerk in March.\nThe \"Number 1 thing\" he wanted to accomplish related to retaining court clerks, he said. The office was losing about one-third of its clerks each year, primarily because the pay was not competitive. Clerks go through a six-month, $50,000 training program \u2014 making them expensive to replace.\nDeRose said he was told it would be impossible to fix the problem, but he said he did so on day 77 of his tenure. He got rid of 10 vacant positions, which provided enough room in the budget to increase clerk pay. No clerk has resigned since the pay raise was implemented a couple of months ago, he said.\nUp next is a plan to go paperless for all civil cases in the next six months \u2014 meaning lawyers and people involved in lawsuits can handle all of paperwork online.\nDeRose said he also ramped up efforts to locate crime victims who are owed restitution. He said his office recently located a victim now living in Australia and provided him with $45,000 he was owed from a vehicle theft years ago.\nDeRose denied Miller's claims that he is trying to politicize the office. He said he has not replaced a single employee since he took over.\n\"It's such a privilege being associated with this office,\" he said.\nFine has spent the majority of his professional life in and around the court systems of Arizona.\nAfter serving as an active duty member of the Air Force, he became a police officer in Goodyear.\nThe growing city was looking for an officer to handle enforcement in the city court, so he became the court marshal and years later, was asked to take over as the court administrator for another 11 years.\nIn 2010, he ran for Justice of the Peace in the southwest Valley and won. When he was running for re-election, a position opened up in Maricopa County and he decided to apply to be the court administrator for the county justice courts.\nHe's been in that role since 2014, but plans to retire next month. During his time at the helm, he implemented innovative strategies to improve services, he said.\nWhen he started, most people who were arrested on a warrant (for non-violent offenses like driving on a suspended license, missing court dates or failing to pay a fine) had to spend 10 days in jail before a judge could see them.\nFine implemented a video appearance room in 2016, which allowed judges to see more offenders without having to transport them great distances. The system reduced the time people spent in jail by more than 50 percent, Fine said.\nHis office is also implementing a text reminder system that alerts people the day before they need to appear in court. Other cities that have adopted similar programs have seen steep reductions in missed court dates, Fine said.\nFine said Maricopa County justice courts experienced similar troubles as the Maricopa County Superior Court with clerks leaving because of pay. He said he got rid of some vacant positions and bumped clerk pay last year, which he said resulted in less turnover.\n\"My goal is to make the court more efficient and easier to use by leveraging proven technologies and implementing best practices,\" he said.\nFine said he has no political ambitions beyond the clerk's office.\nMiller spent her career as a prosecuting attorney for superior, municipal and justice courts in Maricopa and Pinal counties.\nMost recently, she was a deputy county attorney in Maricopa County, specializing in property tax and eminent domain cases in the Superior Court.\nShe retired in October, but decided to run for clerk after Jeanes retired and DeRose was appointed.\nMiller said she's worried that DeRose will politicize the office or use it as a catalyst for his future political career.\n\"The office is too important to be used that way,\" she said.\nMiller said one of her top priorities as clerk would be making sure crime victims receive the restitution they deserve. The Superior Court has millions of dollars in unclaimed restitution.\n\"It's very important and justice is not completed in those cases until crime victims receive the money they're entitled to under the law,\" she said.\nShe also wants to improve access to make it easier for all people to interact with the court system seamlessly.", "Iraqi women must organize in order to ensure their rights in a new democratic system, the lone woman in Iraqs Cabinet said yesterday.\n\u201cThe window of opportunity was opened with the liberation of Iraq,\u201d Nasreen Barwari, minister of municipalities and public works, told a Washington luncheon audience. \u201cIraqi women are capable, are educated, are willing, are ready\u201d to be a part of the political process.\nAs members of the Iraqi Governing Council signed an interim constitution yesterday in Baghdad that included a goal of 25 percent female representatives, a panel sponsored by the United Nations and comprising women from Iraq, Turkey and the United States used International Womens Day to call for further progress.\nPanel member Judith Kipper, director of the Middle East Forum at the Council on Foreign Relations, urged Iraqi women to take advantage of existing social structures to improve their networking and to focus on empowering women economically as well as socially.\nIraqi women have demonstrated their power, using marches and protests in the past month to force the Iraqi Governing Council to repeal a law that would have made family matters subject to the strict Islamic Shariah law.\nAs a result, \u201cwomen now feel confident,\u201d Mrs. Barwari said.\nBut Anita Sharma, director of the Conflict Prevention Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said these achievements must be sustained and the laws must translate into practice on the ground, something that has not always happened.\nDuring the Baath Partys rule, the constitution technically granted many rights to women, but Saddam Hussein issued edicts that violated the constitution, including legalizing honor killings.\nPostwar security issues also pose a problem for women in Iraq.

Maybe your organization has introduced strengths locally but still operates a competency-based system. And here you are, trying to work with strengths and what\u2019s right with people while filling out forms identifying areas for development.\nOne of the most telling times for alignment between your practice and your organization is the formal review, often happening annually. In most organizations, the intent to take a strengths perspective in the review might be there, but the slope toward \u201dareas for development\u201d and \u201dwhat went wrong\u201d can be slippery. Here are a few ideas to help you prepare, stay focused and be purposeful about continuing to embed strengths into your workplace, especially through the performance review cycle.\n1. Stay in close contact with team members. On The Day there should, quite literally, be no surprises. As a manager, you should be continually engaging in ongoing dialogue with your team, building relationships, providing feedback and nudging people on to ever better performance.\n2. Make CliftonStrengths an added value to existing, required review processes. Avoid trying to map strengths onto the competencies you must work with, as defined by HR. Our CliftonStrengths themes don\u2019t describe what we do, but how -- and perhaps why -- we do it. Your themes are a platform for discussing how you get work done in the way truest to you, a means of mastering specific outcomes.\nWhat outputs are/were you looking for?\nWhat do/did you want them to achieve and when?\nHow will they/did they achieve it?\nWhich talent theme has or would the team member apply?\nNote how the team member has used talent themes effectively and be generous with praise and recognition.\nWhat are the individual\u2019s personal desires?\nWhat is the individual\u2019s personal motivator?\nIs the person a self-starter?\nThen have that creative discussion \u2014 \u201cHow would YOU do that?\u201d \u2014 and appreciate that it\u2019s probably very different from how you would do it yourself.\n5. Explore theme interactions. When talking about partnerships, collaborations and influence, raise the question, \u201cWho would you work best with, and why?\u201d Then explore: \u201cHow can you build a relationship, influence or work better with person X?\u201d For example, if you have Achiever toward the bottom of your 34 themes but a colleague has it at number 1, how can you work together successfully even though achievers are typically annoyed by those whom they may perceive to be \u201cslackers\u201d? Try building a relationship with them by working alongside -- and work hard too. Acknowledge their work ethic and how they like to be busy. In team meetings or over lunch, encourage curiosity among your team to think, and talk, about what they each contribute and need to help them be their best.\n7. Define performance outcomes with team members individually. This can help you take an individualistic approach. Determine the outcomes, let them decide with your help the best way to achieve them and then integrate them into the review form.\nIn an ideal world, what would you like to do more of, and what would you like to do less of?\nHow are you going to apply your natural talents to this?\n9. Increase ongoing visibility of strengths in the workplace. It\u2019s crucial for you, and your peers, to verbalize your commitment to strengths, taking opportunities to share thoughts on what using a strengths approach means to your organization or team, or to ask strengths-based questions that are relevant to each theme. Also, consider sharing one or more links to short videos or quotes that offer strengths insights.\nStrengths make a difference in the workplace in many ways. Incorporating them into daily work and highlighting them at review time can make a positive impact on your team and business. The outcomes of introducing strengths into talent and performance management are volume growth of sales, profitability and people development. If your HR systems aren\u2019t yet aligned with strengths, do the best you can and make sure as a manager you are laser sharp in using your own themes to complement and benefit your teams.\nJan Peters utilizes CliftonStrengths to improve communication and teamwork among engineering undergraduates. With a technical background herself, she focuses on building inclusive workplaces, often with science and engineering organizations.\nJan's top 5 strengths are: Strategic | Ideation | Self-Assurance | Activator | Command.\nA thought provoking article on a frustratingly typical situation...the company that wants to focus on strengths but won't quite let go of the traditional evaluation methods. This helps to bridge the gap. Thanks for sharing, Jan!\nWell done, lots of practical advice here.", "Both chambers of the Texas Legislature have revealed significant financial commitments to public education and property tax relief with the House and Senate now zeroed in on the figure of $9 billion, although they continue to take different approaches on how that money might be allocated.\nA most recent development occurred Thursday when a key Senate panel recommended appropriating $4 billion for teacher and librarian pay increases; $2.3 billion toward school finance overhaul and $2.7 billion for property tax release, according to our story Friday. This marked a huge increase from the Senate\u2019s earlier plan that totaled $6 billion ($3.7 billion for teacher pay and $2.3 billion for property tax relief). It\u2019s worth noting the recommendation from the Senate Finance Committee is yet to go to the full Senate for approval.\nA day earlier, the House approved a budget that called for $6 billion in school spending and $3 billion in property tax relief. Eventually, members from each house will meet to work through differences. Regardless, as our story pointed out, the moves represent a marked shift in political winds with regard to public education spending.\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced and optimistic that as we continue through this legislative process that these numbers will change \u2013 they always do as we all know,\u201d Sen. Larry Taylor (R-Friendswood) said in our story, \u201cbut I know that at the end of the day we\u2019ll take very large steps to improve the education outcomes for our students while providing meaningful tax savings for our businesses and homeowners and improve the pay of our teachers.\u201d Taylor chairs the public education working group of the Senate Finance Committee.\nAccording to statistics, a mere decade ago, Texas provided as much as 48.5 percent of education funding, but that number has dwindled to its current 38 percent with school districts forced to rely more heavily upon property tax dollars. Rep. John Zerwas, in our story this week, said his budget bill would push the percentage to 42 percent. Zerwas (R-Richmond) chairs the House Appropriations Committee.\nThe Senate\u2019s decision to increase its budgetary commitment to the two priority items was seen by some as a reaction to last November\u2019s election in which Democrats made gains in both houses and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick\u2019s margin of re-election was much slimmer compared to his 2014 victory, and some of Patrick\u2019s staunchest allies lost their election bids. Likewise, virtually every major poll of voters has demonstrated a growing impatience over state lawmakers taking real action on property tax and public education.\n\u201cThis is about shifts in perception of the Republican leadership about what their constituents want, and their read of the political lay of the land, and it\u2019s strongly influenced by their interpretation of results of 2018 elections,\u201d James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, said in our story. He also co-directs a series of polls on Texas politics. In other words, enough voters across the Lone Star State are not just making their voices heard, they also are getting their message acted upon through decisions at the polls.\nSchool districts by and large seem to favor the House plan because it provides more freedom as far as how districts will allocate dollars. Beyond that, though, the fact that the Senate\u2019s number was the same as the House\u2019s was seen as a victory for Texas public education.\n\u201cWhat a day when both chambers are looking at putting substantial investments in public education,\u201d Nicole Conley Johnson, a member of the Texas Commission on Finance, said in our story.\nStill, the House plan is viewed more favorably. Primarily, that\u2019s because it allows districts more latitude in terms of salary boosts. It is universally agreed upon that teachers are vastly underpaid for the role they play in Texas communities. That said, it is likewise important to remember they are not the only part of the workforce involved when it comes to public education. It is sometimes easy to overlook other, important people and the work they do, as Johnson pointed out in our story.\nHere\u2019s the deal. The cuts in public education funding did not happen in one session. They took place over time. Restoring that commitment to a place where Texas is among the nation\u2019s leaders won\u2019t happen in one session, either. But the House and the Senate are on the right track, rightfully and fiscally saying: Texas must lead the way.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect one cycle of the Legislature to make amends for all the sins of the past,\u201d Louis Malfaro, who is with the Texas American Federation of Teachers, said in our story.\nFair enough, but the journey begins with the first step, and that is the path state lawmakers appear ready and willing to travel.", "Rami Malek is opening up about his seriously awkward snub from Nicole Kidman live on stage at the 2019 Golden Globe Awards that quickly went viral online.

Less than a year later, it was apparent that the Bush administration wanted to invade Iraq, allegedly as part of the response. Famously, selling this agenda involved a highly deceptive effort to link the two issues. Iraq was said to have an advanced nuclear weapons program and to be likely to provide the fruits of its research to al-Qaeda.\nAll this we know. Less well remembered nowadays, though -- in fact, almost never discussed in the major media -- was another implicit prong of the argument: that invading Iraq would be cheap and easy, leaving plenty of resources for other purposes. When White House economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey stumbled off message in September 2002 with his prediction that war could cost $100 billion to $200 billion, the administration flew into crisis mode. Budget Director Mitch Daniels was trotted out to label the estimate \u201cvery, very high.\u201d Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz opined -- in testimony to Congress, no less -- that reconstruction would cost virtually nothing in light of Iraq's promising oil revenues. Daniels proffered an estimate in the $50 billion to $60 billion range, substantially less than the $80 billion inflation-adjusted cost of the Persian Gulf War. Lindsey, famously, was soon after fired -- for his troublesome cost estimates and, reportedly, the President's annoyance at his poor personal fitness habits.\nBy April 2006, a Congressional Research Service (CRS) inquiry concluded that Lindsey's estimate was, indeed, way off -- but in the other direction. Around $261 billion had already been spent. Given the human stakes, it may seem crass to worry overly much about the dollar cost of a military conflict. But the fact that a CRS report is needed at all, as opposed to the straightforward accounting that either the White House or the Pentagon could surely provide were they so inclined, points to the basic reality that the war's proponents are continuing the prewar pattern of covering up the costs. And with good reason: They're enormous. Scandalously enormous.\nWartime appropriations do not, for example, include the cost of disability payments to veterans wounded in the war, payments that will continue throughout their life spans. Nor do they cover the costs of medical treatment for those seriously injured in the war, or even such basic war-related costs as the replacement of equipment and munitions expended in the conflict or the need to transport soldiers back to their home bases when they rotate out of country. The war has also substantially increased the military's overall recruiting costs, reflected in bigger bonuses and additional recruiters. What's more, by combining the war with aggressive tax cutting, the administration has ensured that the operation is paid for entirely by borrowing money on which interest will need to be paid. The shocking truth, according to Bilmes and Stiglitz, is that if one applies the Congressional Budget Office's basic assumptions about the duration of the conflict (\u201ca small but continuous presence\u201d), it will cost nearly a staggering $1.27 trillion dollars before all is said and done.\nThe number is so high as to defy human comprehension. All the numbers ending in \u201c-illion\u201d sound the same. But a trillion is what you get if you spend a million dollars a day \u2026 for a million days. That's 2,737 years -- a cool mil a day, every day, in other words, until the Year of Our Lord 4743. Or, working backward, from the time when Homer wrote the Iliad up to now. The $270 billion in rounding error is worth another 750 years at the million-a-day rate. That takes us up to the year 5493 -- or back to when Moses fled Egypt.\nAnyway you slice it, it's a lot of money. More than enough to fund any sort of \u201ctoo expensive\u201d pie-in-the-sky liberal domestic scheme. Universal preschool, for example, clocks in at about $35 billion annually -- cheap enough to get 37 years' worth. But Bush never said invading Iraq would educate our children or fight domestic poverty, so let's not even get into that, for now. What the President did promise was the following: that regime change would curb nuclear proliferation, weaken al-Qaeda, and create a shining beacon of democracy. What happened? We eliminated a nuclear program that didn't exist, encouraged Iran and North Korea to speed theirs along, offered terrorists a gigantic recruiting opportunity and training ground, and turned Iraq into a venue for chaos and civil war plagued by death squads and offering local despots a handy cautionary tale about the dangers of liberalization.\nFor $1.27 trillion, we have our hands full in a quagmire; the world hating us; worldwide acts of terrorism on the sharp rise; and much more. We could have done better. Much better. You might even say a trillion times better. Economists use the term \u201copportunity cost\u201d to refer to the cost of an endeavor in terms of the opportunities that endeavor foreclosed. Iraq foreclosed advancing important humanitarian goals, killing and capturing terrorists more effectively, eliminating nuclear threats, and securing the homeland among other goals. Here are 11 ways it could have been different -- and still could be, come January 20, 2009.\nThe American military is, by global standards, enormous and remains without a doubt the world's top fighting force. Nevertheless, it's still mainly geared for Cold War\u2013era threats and countering conventional foes. The new world has less need for heavy weapons, but more need for special forces to hunt down and eliminate small groups of radicals and various types of boots on the ground to help bring stability to chaotic areas. Echoing John Kerry's presidential campaign, the Center for American Progress's liberal alternative to the official Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) proposed increasing the authorized strength of the U.S. Army substantially. The idea is to add 50,000 special-operations forces to fight the new kind of battles, plus 26,000 soldiers for two new peacekeeping divisions, and 10,000 additional civil affairs and military police officers. That way, if the United States ever did come across a legitimate reason to mount an Iraq-scale stabilization we might have the chance to do it properly. The price tag over the life of a QDR is $60 billion.\nThe threat of nuclear terrorism was the most potent argument raised in favor of the Iraq War, and understandably so. Conventional terrorist attacks, though tragic, can't fundamentally threaten the United States in the way our great adversaries of the past did. A single nuclear detonation in an American city would, however, be a catastrophe in terms of its death toll and the inevitable crackdown on civil liberties. The American way of life as we understand it would never be the same. There were, of course, no nuclear weapons in Iraq and no program to make them. But there is plenty of fissile material in the former Soviet Union. The good news is that our government has programs in place to remove them that have been rated highly effective. The bad news is that they're working slowly. The 2001 Baker-Cutler Commission on the subject estimated that $30 billion over 10 years would get the job of destroying much of it and securing the rest done expeditiously.\nRemember Afghanistan? The place where the old regime actually was harboring al-Qaeda, and we really were welcomed as liberators? We never quite finished off the enemy there, and recent weeks have seen the highest level of violence since 2001. We desperately need to shore up popular support for Hamid Karzai's government. Today, there is a gap between estimates of what's needed to rebuild the country and what the international community has pledged in aid. About $8.6 billion over the next seven years would close it. Meanwhile, the country's main economic activity is growing opium for sale to the world's heroin dealers. The total value of the crop over five years is about $11 billion. If we were prepared to spend that much, we could follow a Center for American Progress proposal to pay Afghan farmers to not grow the stuff, taking the crops off the world market and giving the farmers breathing room to make the transition to cultivating something else.\nConservatives often deride the United Nations as ineffectual. The reality, however, is that U.N. peacekeeping has a very good track record (better, certainly, than the track record of unilateral American-sponsored regime change) in those instances where an appropriate level of resources has been available. A Center for Defense Information task force has proposed that we pony up an additional $5 billion over 10 years in financial support for these missions to make them more robust. The same task force also recommended that we sponsor the creation of a 5,000-strong standing international civilian police force under U.N. auspices that could act quickly in global trouble spots while the world's governments think out longer-term solutions. The American share of the bill would be about $2 billion over 10 years.\nOn 9-11, the terrorists hijacked airplanes, and since that time a great deal has been done to make it harder to do exactly the same thing again. Nothing, however, requires terrorists to focus exclusively on airplanes as possible targets. Indeed, more recent attacks in London and Madrid have both come against rail transportation targets. The American Public Transportation Association estimates that fully securing American public transportation would cost $5.2 billion in one-time capital improvements and $800 million annually in new money for personnel, training, and technical support. The additional money would put security cameras in trains and train stations currently lacking them, place automatic vehicle locator systems in buses so emergency responders can find them in case of a problem, develop systems to detect hazardous chemicals, hire more security guards, and improve communications systems. The most recent federal budget boosted public transportation security spending, but it's still at around half the needed level -- even though public transportation has about 16 times the passenger load of air travel and the attacks in Europe show terrorists are just as happy to strike trains as planes.\nNews a while back that a state-owned firm from the United Arab Emirates may operate several American ports provoked instant outrage around the country. But keeping ports out of foreign hands is a small issue compared to the generally lax state of security at America's shipping facilities. The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act, introduced by a bipartisan group of senators, is considered the gold standard in terms of preventing the smuggling of nuclear materials or other dangerous weapons through America's container ports. The legislation is languishing in Congress because deficit-conscious legislators propose to finance it through a roughly $20-per-container fee, which, naturally, the relevant businesses don't want to pay. The Gordian knot could be cut by letting taxpayers pick up the $1.5 billion annual bill (call it $15 billion over 10 years) to buy radiation detectors, establish a multitiered system of container security standards, boost grants to local port authorities, improve the U.S. Customs Service's existing Automated Targeting System, create a uniform data system for export and import information, and establish joint operating centers to facilitate day-to-day management of port security issues.\nMuch has been done to improve the security on America's commercial passenger jets. Much less has been done regarding cargo that's often carried in these very same planes. An estimated 55,000 tons of freight is shipped around the United States each day, with Congressional Research Service indicating that about a quarter of domestic shipping and almost half of international shipping is done on passenger planes. Legislation introduced by two congressmen, Republican Chris Shays and Democrat Ed Markey, would require 100 percent screening of all air cargo. David Wirsing, executive director of the Airforwarders Association, an airfreight industry group, noted in opposition to the bill that it would require \u201ca cost of over $700 million in the first year alone.\u201d But this is actually a rather modest sum of money in the grand scheme of America's $450 billion and rising annual security budget. More genuinely extravagant would be equipping commercial airliners with defenses against the approximately 100,000 shoulder-launched missiles floating around the world at a price of $10 billion.\nMore troops could improve America's security situation in a variety of ways. But terrorism isn't only -- or even primarily -- a task for soldiers. Civilian emergency responders -- cops, firemen, emergency medical technicians -- do much of the heavy lifting. A total of $5 billion would double the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, and $14 billion would fully fund the Community Oriented Policing Services Program, both for 10 years. Both programs offer financial assistance to state and local governments in maintaining adequate emergency response manpower. Meanwhile, as things stand, emergency response radio systems are still largely non-interoperable, a situation that had tragic consequences for New York City's police and firefighters on 9-11. Just $350 million could resolve the problem.\nEveryone acknowledges that fighting Islamic extremism has a large diplomatic component, oriented toward the hearts-and-minds question. A panel appointed by the Bush administration proposed a $12 billion increase in funding for public diplomacy over 10 years to help improve America's standing in the world, but it never happened. Throwing money at the problem won't solve anything on its own, but it would help. Extra cash could be used to upgrade the language skills of America's diplomats (according to the Government Accountability Office, 30 percent of language-designated public diplomacy positions in the Muslim world are filled with officers who lack the required linguistic ability), conduct audience research and segment target audiences as seen in the private sector, open more consulates in Muslim countries, and improve the quality and quantity of broadcasts in Arabic, Farsi, and other languages widely spoken in the Muslim world.\nOK, so far, assuming all nine of the above are funded fully, we've spent $228.65 billion, leaving around $1 trillion still unallocated. Where else should we spend it? Well, the war has also been justified on humanitarian grounds as a means of helping the Iraqi people and ameliorating political conditions throughout the Muslim world. In practice, however, starting wars (as opposed to, say, curing diseases) is a highly inefficient method of helping suffering people, and the war has devastated America's moral standing worldwide. Development assistance could massively improve it.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, for example, that a onetime expenditure of less than $500 million would allow the WHO to bring about a 90 percent reduction in measles deaths. This would save hundreds of thousands of lives over a period of years for less than what Congress appropriates per week for Iraq. Measles, as it happens, isn't a major problem in Arab countries, but Muslim Nigeria, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Bangladesh combine with India to account for almost 80 percent of the world's measles deaths.\nIndeed, useful foreign-aid programs are generally so cheap that listing them one by one would take forever. Fortunately, there's a convenient aggregate at hand. Over the past several years the United Nations, in consultation with leading experts and potential donor governments, has formulated an ambitious foreign-aid program known as the Millennium Development Goals. Like most developed countries, the United States has agreed in principle to boost spending up to the levels called for in the goals but hasn't actually appropriated the money.\nThe goals, among other things, promise to reduce by half the proportion of people living on less than a dollar per day, reduce by half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, ensure that all children complete a course of primary education, eliminate gender disparities in education, reduce the child mortality rate by two-thirds, reduce the maternal mortality rate by three-quarters, and reduce by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water. All this can be done by approximately 2015, according to the U.N., if the rich countries of the world increase their level of foreign aid to the promised level of 0.7 percent of GDP and reform current giving to conform to the targets. The total price tag for the United States would be about $1.04 trillion, which would represent a boost over current levels of about $650 billion.\nIn a May 10 Washington Post op-ed piece, University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein argued that \u201cthe economic burden of the Iraq War is on the verge of exceeding the total anticipated burden of the Kyoto Protocol.\u201d Sunstein's argument, predictably, came under attack from the right, but in fact he seriously understated his case. The estimated $325 billion cost of Kyoto refers not to direct budgetary costs -- most academic studies have concluded that these would be extremely small. Instead, the figure refers to indirect costs to economic growth. This is a large price to pay, but as with the rest it's significantly less than the economic impact of the war. On top of the $1.27 trillion in direct expenditures, however, Bilmes and Stiglitz also anticipate an additional trillion or so in indirect reduced economic growth. Without the invasion, in other words, we could have both gotten a jump on the emerging challenge of global warming and enjoyed higher levels of overall prosperity than we're seeing today.\nHad we followed the course suggested above, the world would not only be a better place and the United States a more secure country; we would be in an infinitely better position to push the agenda of regional political transformation in the Middle East that now stands as the ostensible rationale for the Iraq venture. Beyond the mess in Iraq itself, our efforts at political reform have been persistently undermined by the United States' massive unpopularity in the Muslim world. A despised foreign power has little ability to influence events in a constructive direction, and at the moment the tendency is for political liberalization to merely boost the position of radical parties like Hamas in Palestine or the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. In the bargain, we would be saving around $400 billion -- hardly chump change -- that could be directed to domestic priorities.\nAnti-Americanism has abated somewhat recently from its post\u2013Iraq invasion peak, but it still remains incredibly strong in almost every Muslim country. The main exception is Indonesia, where the 2005 Pew Research Center survey of Islamic opinion registered an enormous 23 point jump in pro-American sentiments, a phenomenon virtually all observers attribute to our relatively generous response to the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that devastated the country. The lesson is clear -- when the United States directs its counterterrorism efforts to genuine self-defense, and channels its idealistic impulses into uncontroversial popular causes rather than as add-on rationales for war-waging, world opinion looks more kindly on the United States. That gives us much more ability to do everything from pressing for political reform to trying to assemble a diplomatic coalition to block Iran's nuclear ambitions. Instead, America stands not only remarkably undefended against the possibility of terrorist attack, but also isolated on the world stage.\nWhat's done, of course, is done and can't be undone. We can't unfight the war. The country can, however, still change course in a variety of ways. Some of these goals -- securing loose nuclear material comes to mind -- are sufficiently important that it makes sense to brush budgetary constraints aside. For others, like cargo inspections, it's worth doing the political heavy lifting necessary to get them financed by user fees if it's not possible to find the money in the general budget.\nBudgetary offsets outside of Iraq could also do a great deal to help put us on the right track. The military spending priorities reflected in the most recent Quadrennial Defense Review are badly outdated, reflecting an orientation toward a no-longer-extant Soviet threat or a merely hypothetical Chinese one rather than America's actual defense needs. Not coincidentally, these priorities also reflect the defense industry's preference for hardware over manpower. Eliminating unneeded weapons systems like the F/A-22 Raptor plane, the Virginia Class submarine, the DD(X) destroyer, and the V-22 Osprey helicopter could generate more than enough funds to finance needed increases in special forces and peacekeeping missions. Cutting back on ballistic missile defense and America's overly large nuclear arsenal -- still, 15 years after the Soviet Union's collapse, a stunning 4,500 weapons, far more than are needed to hit any conceivable set of military targets -- might finance increased expenditures on homeland-security needs. On the foreign-aid front, much good could be done by simply reorienting current spending, much of which is not seriously targeted at helping the world's neediest, and incremental progress toward the Millennium Goals would do enormous good even if we don't reach the targets in a timely manner.\nWhen you're in a hole it's always a good idea to stop digging. The total bill for the Iraq War isn't yet a fixed quantity -- it's still going on. Stiglitz and Bilmes assume, following the Congressional Budget Office, the existence of a small-but-continuous American military presence in Iraq through 2015. This estimate could, of course, prove mistaken (in either direction). But the sooner we get out of Iraq, the faster we'll be able to start directing our resources to more productive uses. Conversely, things could get much worse if, as some suggest, we launch a new war with Iran. To be sure, today's talk is of targeted airstrikes rather than full-scale war, but talk before the invasion of Iraq was of a $50 billion to $80 billion cakewalk, not a $1.27 trillion debacle. The odds of the Bush administration suddenly deciding to change course are low, but with the GOP on the ropes politically, Democrats have the chance to outline a serious alternative agenda if they care to seize it.

This would be simplified and clarified, he said.\nThere is a push to improve protection for individuals' privacy and this is likely to gain momentum since Irish passed the Lisbon treaty, Hustinx said.\nThere is now competition between various European commissioners to be the lead on privacy.

Several officers can be seen pushing through a crowd on a stairway to reach Al-Matar, but soon move out of view of the camera.\nThe fact that Al-Matar was wearing a headscarf, known as a hijab, and the face veil, called a niqab, \"was the impetus behind the actions\" of the officers, the court filing alleges. In a statement Tuesday, Phil Robertson, a lawyer for the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, and a co-counsel in the civil case, argued that \"blatant xenophobia, Islamophobia, and racial profiling\" underpinned the officers' actions.\nA police report filed the night of the incident says officers had been \"on high alert of terrorist activity\" on the Fourth of July holiday when they spotted Al-Matar exhibiting what they believed was \"suspicious behavior,\" including walking at \"a brisk pace, in a determined manner.\" It also says officers saw what they thought could be \"incendiary devices\" around her ankles and were also suspicious of her backpack, which was clutched to her chest.\n\"(Officers) believed that subject might be a lone wolf suicide bomber and decided to attempt to take subject into custody,\" it says.\nA K-9 unit searched for explosive materials, the report says, \"with negative results,\" while \"the objects strapped around arrestee's ankles\" turned out to be \"ankle weights.\" But Al-Matar was still charged, including with obstructing justice after police accusing her of resisting and refusing to comply with orders. She was acquitted on all charges at a state trial earlier this year.\nTuesday's lawsuit names six officers and the city of Chicago as defendants, accusing them of excessive force, false arrest, violation of freedom of religious expression and malicious prosecution.\nA police spokesman declined comment specifically on the suit, saying the department doesn't comment on pending litigation. But police issued a brief written statement that says \"officers work hard each day to investigate suspicious activity and fight crime and we strive to treat all individuals with the highest levels of dignity of respect.\" The city's law department, which represents officers in civil litigation, declined comment.\nThe case comes amid heightened scrutiny of city police.

Oz also is working with the NFL to make football safer for players by speaking at clinics for mothers of youth players about diagnosing concussions, proper tackling techniques, and how to ensure that coaches appropriately manage injuries.\nAs detailed by the recent PBS documentary \"League of Denial,\" the NFL has been accused of failing to inform its players of mounting evidence that playing football can expose players to risks of long-term brain damage. In August, the NFL reached a $765 million settlement with more than 4,000 current and former players who sued the league for covering up the danger of a sport that left many of them depressed, suicidal, and lacking memory.\nThe \"Together We Make Football\" campaign is an attempt to help repair the NFL's image this season by asking celebrity spokespeople to tell their stories of how the game has influenced their lives in a positive way. By doing so, the league seems to be trying to convey that the social benefits provided by football \u2014 like the increased sense of community shared by a city with a winning team or the teamwork lessons young people absorb from playing \u2014 outweigh whatever health risks the game might present.", "Two days after the U.S. Treasury put Turkish Justice Minister Abd\u00fclhamit G\u00fcl and Interior Minister S\u00fcleyman Soylu on its sanctions list over the continued arrest of American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson, the top diplomats of the two countries met to seek an acceptable exit from the situation.\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed the escalating crisis on Aug. 3 in Singapore on the sidelines of an ASEAN conference.\nRight after his meeting with Pompeo, \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said it was constructive, but the Turkish side would not accept threats from the U.S. as a way to solve problems, especially when there is a legal process involved. A State Department release later in the day confirmed that the meeting was a constructive one and contacts would continue in pursuit of a solution, but made it clear that there was no change in the original American stance.\nThe original U.S. stance, as announced by both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, was that Turkey, a NATO ally of the U.S., would face sanctions as long as Brunson was not released. An \u0130zmir court on July 25 ruled that Brunson could leave the prison where he was held for the last 20 months only to be moved to house arrest with an electronic tagging on. The sanctions came on Aug. 1. Additional statements from the American side hinting more sanctions if Brunson does not get released caused speculations that there could be more names in the upper echelons of Turkey\u2019s political and business worlds.\nIt is clear that the senior Turkish and American diplomats told each other about the sensitivities of their governments once again. This is the first time the U.S. announced sanctions on an ally country, along with threats of an arms embargo.\nThe mood in Turkey is almost a \u201crally around the flag\u201d one. Even people critical of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s politics think it is not the right time to highlight the differences and believe the humiliating tone deployed by the American administration should not be bowed down to.\nThe sensitivity of the Turkish side is clear: Fethullah G\u00fclen, the Islamist preacher leading an illegal network and accused of masterminding the 2016 military coup attempt, is still living in the U.S. without facing any legal action. And despite a relieving agreement over the Syrian town of Manbij, the collaboration of the U.S. forces with the Syrian branch of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) is still continuing.\nThe American side\u2019s sensitivity is Brunson. They believe he could be released based on their assumption that Turkish courts are not independent and Erdo\u011fan could do something about it \u2014 which they possibly supposed from a previous statement by Erdo\u011fan, when he told Trump to \u201cgive the priest\u201d to \u201ctake the priest\u201d in return, meaning he wanted G\u00fclen in return.\nThe rift takes place at a time when meeting the demands of the evangelical community back home could be crucial for the Trump-Pence team as the country is heading toward mid-term elections in November. Pence is known to be a strong evangelical believer too. It is also clear that Washington\u2019s perception of Turkey is not a bright one at all. Politicians and top officials think they could dispense with Turkey without consequences. On the other hand, it seems Pentagon, headed by Jim Mattis, and the State Department, headed by Pompeo, are making efforts not to lose Turkey and finding a way to get what the Trump-Pence team wants.\nErdo\u011fan and Trump should give diplomacy a chance without forgetting that it is time to cool down Turkish-U.S. relations, or maybe even put them on ice, as Sedat Ergin of daily H\u00fcrriyet said recently, not add fuel to the fire.\nDevastating Easter bombings in Sri Lanka were retaliation for recent deadly attacks on mosques in New Zealand, a Sri Lankan official said on April 23, adding that two domestic radical groups were believed to have been behind April 21\u2019s blasts.", "If No End to Incentives for Jobs, then What?\nNevada\u2019s recent incentive package, valued at $1.25 billion, to bring Tesla\u2019s battery production near Reno has reignited a longstanding debate about the merits of state and local economic development subsidies to attract or retain firms and whether to ban the practice all together.\nLet\u2019s be honest: The ingrained practice of taxpayer-funded business recruitment has not lessened despite the mounting evidence that many incentives don\u2019t actually pay off. The firms that receive incentives do not tend to generate more jobs than firms that don\u2019t get them. And the overwhelming majority of state job growth comes from births of new establishments or expansion of existing establishments, not from firms moving to the state.\nProviding tax breaks to individual firms distorts markets and is a highly inefficient use of public resources. Some states are moving to provide broader tax incentives for firm activities in priority industry clusters as they come into or expand in a local market. While being approached by Google, Iowa decided not to give that company its own tax break but instead passed legislation to provide tax abatements on equipment and infrastructure purchases by any data centers coming into the state. This broader approach helped attract multiple high-tech firms bringing their data storage facilities to the state.\n3. Lure firms with assets, not just cost reductions.\nSouth Carolina, one of the best in attracting and deepening foreign investments in key clusters from target markets like Germany, often leads their attraction efforts with their investments in world class workforce training programs, modern port and infrastructure, and responsive business climate. The state has also adopted a German-inspired apprenticeship program, Apprenticeship Carolina, which pairs subsidized on-the-job training for workers at firms like Robert Bosch and BMW with industry-focused technical college skills development. And it has invested in advanced R&D programs, including the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research, to bolster the state\u2019s highly-competitive auto-related clusters.\n4. Make incentive strategies and practices more responsible and effective.\nAs Tim Bartik, Brian Kelsey and others have argued, incentives should be both transparent, so that the public understands the costs and benefits before a deal is finalized, and aimed at high-quality jobs that raise the standard of living. The states of Oregon, Washington and Rhode Island have all integrated evaluation processes into their incentive strategies, including public hearings and formal budgetary review, to ensure public input and review into their business recruitment practices.\n5. Focus on what matters to economic growth.\nFinally, the best regional economic leaders know that, while firm movements are always afoot, the real opportunities to grow sustained prosperity comes from a focus on local assets and clusters. The Kansas City region, which straddles Kansas and Missouri, has embarked on a renewed regional conversation about the factors that can contribute to economic competitiveness. Rather than have the border war between its two governors dominate economic debate, Kansas City area leaders are actively working together to expand the economic development toolkit to strategies that strengthen trade, innovation and talent development as the course to better jobs and opportunity.\nBy adopting these approaches, cities, states and regions can move toward a more effective and efficient model of economic growth, one that relies less on traditional incentives.", "Government spending and debt are emerging as a campaign tug-of-war, with Mitt Romney blaming President Barack Obama for a \"prairie fire of debt\" and Obama calling the charge a \"cowpie of distortion.\" House Speaker John Boehner is talking about a debt ceiling that is still more than eight months away.\nWhat gives? In a word, polling.\nThe American public is growing increasingly distressed about government spending and high budgets. The issue now ranks as high on the worry scale as lack of jobs. And it worked well for Republicans in 2010, who galvanized voters with ads and flyers that drew attention to government red ink and took back control of the U.S. House after four years of Democratic rule.\nRepublicans are looking for that magic again.\nRomney has maintained a drumbeat of criticism over Obama's handling of federal spending and the national debt in recent weeks, forcing the president on the defensive on an issue where public opinion is stacked against him.\nIn Iowa earlier this month, Romney said a \"prairie fire of debt\" was sweeping across the nation, threatening the country's future. He accused Obama of inflating the debt that he had pledged to reduce and ballooning the federal budget deficit with the 2009 economic stimulus and 2010 health care bill after saying he would cut it sharply.\nObama, in campaign events in Colorado, California and Iowa this week, argued that federal spending had slowed to rates not seen in decades after he inherited a $1 trillion large debt and later pushed for $2 trillion in spending cuts. The president pointed to Romney's tax proposal, saying it would give millionaires tax cuts at the expense of the debt.\nObama called Romney's claims a \"cowpie of distortion\" and would saddle the debt with $5 trillion in new tax cuts, likening it to trying to put out \"a prairie fire with some gasoline.\"\n\"What happens is, the Republicans run up the tab, and then we're sitting there and they've left the restaurant,\" Obama said at a campaign event in Des Moines. \"And then they point and (say), 'Why did you order all those steaks and martinis?'\"\nObama's defensive crouch on debt and spending reflect a hard reality: Polls consistently show voters, including sought-after independents, placing more trust in Romney to handle the massive debt. The nation's economy remains a focal point for voters but many remain concerned that years of heavy federal spending on guns and butter could leave the U.S. in a similar position as Greece and other European nations grappling with massive debt.\nA Gallup/USA Today poll conducted May 10-13 found that overall, 82 percent of Americans called the \"federal budget deficit and debt\" extremely or very important, a level of interest comparable to unemployment. The same poll found Romney with a broad advantage on handling the budget deficit and debt, with 54 percent saying he would do a better job handling it compared with 39 percent who chose Obama.\nThe results mirrored an April Washington Post/ABC News poll, which found 51 percent of Americans sided with Romney on handling the federal budget deficit, compared with 38 percent for Obama. Among independents, 60 percent preferred Romney while 29 percent thought Obama would do a better job handling it.\nThe White House has tried to respond. Traveling to Colorado Springs, Colo., White House press secretary Jay Carney cited an analysis by MarketWatch that said spending under Obama had grown more slowly than any president since Dwight Eisenhower.\nA few hours later, Obama picked up on the piece, telling donors in Denver that his work to pay down the federal debt in a \"balanced and responsible\" way was \"starting to appear in places \u2014 real liberal outlets like the Wall Street Journal \u2014 since I've been president, federal spending has risen at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years.\" MarketWatch is published by Dow Jones & Co., which also publishes the Wall Street Journal.\nYet, Obama's budget stewardship is open to interpretation. The debt now stands at $15.7 trillion, compared to $10.6 trillion on his inauguration day. On a dollar basis, that's the biggest ever jump in the debt. How much the debt has grown can also be measures as a percentage of what he inherited. By that measure, the debt has increased by half during the three-and-a-half year Obama administration. During President Ronald Reagan's eight-year administration, the debt nearly tripled, from about $910 billion to more than $2.6 trillion.\nStill, much of the increase during Obama's tenure has been a consequence of the recession. In a poor economy, government spending increases automatically because more Americans become eligible for food stamps, unemployment assistance and Medicaid. Also, a poor economy leads to unemployment which cuts into tax revenue. As a result, deficits are inevitable as more money goes out and less comes in.\nTo be sure, Obama pushed through a stimulus package that cost more than $800 billion and he and President George Bush both approved spending of the $700 billion bank bailout in 2008 and 2009. But those costs are not recurrent.\n\"It's important to understand the reason why the debt went up by so much,\" said Robert Bixby of the budget watchdog group The Concord Coalition. \"We certainly do have a very serious long-term debt problem in the country. We have an underlying structural imbalance between what we are promising, mostly in entitlement benefits, and what we're willing to pay for in taxes. But in the short-term there are a lot of factors that are pushing the debt up that aren't related to fiscal policy.\"\nAdd to the mix Boehner, who has said when Congress is asked to raise the nation's borrowing cap after the election, he will insist on spending cuts to offset the increase. Democratic leaders call it an irresponsible course of action, noting that the gridlock over the debt ceiling last year caused a downgrading of the U.S. government's credit rating.\nAll of this is aimed at unaligned, independent voters.\nIn turning attention to debt, Republicans are tapping a winning issue they deployed in congressional races two years ago. In October of 2010, Republican pollster Wes Anderson said, congressional campaigns shifted \"away from jobs and economy to government taking us over the cliff.\" The emphasis proved to be a success at the ballot box.\nThese days, the economy remains the preeminent issue in voters' minds, but Anderson says middle-of-the-road votes are the targets of the big government message.\n\"The middle is angry about where we are at and they really see two villains on this stage, this play has two antagonists. Both of them are big,\" said Anderson, who is working on congressional and statewide political campaigns in several states that are presidential battlegrounds. \"One is big business, big Wall Street, big insurance, big oil, just big, abusing the middle class, abusing small businesses, abusing the taxpayer. The other is big government \u2014 big government wildly running up massive deficits and debt which abuse the taxpayer, the middle class and small business.\"\nIndependent voters, he said, \"hold both of those central tenets to be true.\"", "JERUSALEM \u2013 Unless new funding quickly arrives, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) may be forced to suspend its voucher food assistance in July for nearly 150,000 people in Gaza and the West Bank, the majority of whom are women and children.\nThis is at the same time as a major energy crisis is affecting the impoverished Gaza Strip.\nWFP urgently requires US$6.6 million to provide food assistance through vouchers for the next three months to the poorest non-refugee families in Gaza and the West Bank.\nThe energy crisis has eroded people\u2019s purchasing power and increased the prices of basic essentials. The poorest families, including those assisted by WFP, are affected the most. Critical services in Gaza, such as health, water and sanitation, are no longer available after the shutdown of the sole power plant.\nWFP is seriously concerned about the potential interruption of its food assistance to 92,000 people in Gaza, which is provided in partnership with the Ministry of Social Development and Global Communities, an international non-governmental organization. Credited with US$10.30 per person each month, WFP vouchers allow families to buy essential nutritious and locally-produced food.\nA disruption of WFP assistance would further undermine food security and deepen the dire living conditions of the poorest families, most of whom live on less than US$3.20 per day.\nIn the West Bank, where WFP provides vouchers to 57,000 people in cooperation with the Ministry of Social Development, slow economic growth and movement restrictions on people and goods continue to limit people\u2019s employment opportunities. As food accounts for more than half of the budget of vulnerable people in these areas, WFP assistance is critical.\nFood insecurity in Palestine is driven by high unemployment and people\u2019s limited ability to purchase food. Today, more than a quarter of the Palestinian population \u2013 or 1.6 million people \u2013 require food assistance. In Gaza, where the unemployment rate exceeds 40 percent, more than 46 percent of people require food assistance.\nOver the first quarter of 2017, WFP provided food assistance through vouchers and direct distributions to nearly 480,000 poor people each month, with more than 40 percent through food vouchers. WFP vouchers contribute to the economy and local markets in Gaza, through the use of shops for purchase and distribution of locally-produced commodities.\nSince 2011, WFP has injected more than US$146 million into the Palestinian economy through vouchers, including US$63 million in Gaza. WFP vouchers have had a positive economic impact, resulting in increased sales and investments while creating jobs in the retail, dairy and farming sectors.", "January is a stressful month for British football managers. Under the rules of the UK's Football Association (FA), they have 31 days in which to buy new players and sell old ones. And changed immigration rules, which came into effect in the autumn, could raise managers' blood pressure even further by the time the transfer window closes on 2 February.\nUnder a new points-based visa system, any players who originate from outside the EU will have to apply for a Tier 2 skilled worker visa and prove that they have basic English skills before they will be allowed to kick a ball professionally in Britain.\nWith the rapid globalisation of the game, there has been a steady increase in the number of players arriving from abroad. More than 20 players from outside the EU joined English clubs during last year's September transfer window, bringing the total in the Premier League alone to 100.\nThe credit crunch is likely to limit many clubs' spending power and fewer transfers are expected this month than in previous years. The notable exception is Manchester City, which is now backed by the deep pockets of the Abu Dhabi United Group.\nBut with non-EU players representing the good value for money that most clubs are desperately seeking, there will be some who will need to pass an examination other than their medical.\nTo qualify in the Tier 2 skilled category, elite sportspeople and coaches must accumulate sufficient points in a range of areas to do with their work and status. For footballers these include providing proof from their sport's governing body that they are internationally established at the highest level, and that their place on a squad will make a significant contribution to the game and cannot be filled by a \"settled worker\".\nThey must also be able to support themselves financially. That is not likely to be a challenge for top-flight players. What could be, however, is the requirement to attain set levels in one of more than 25 internationally available tests of English. \"We are determined that newcomers should speak English and integrate into British life,\" border and immigration minister Phil Woolas said, \"so anyone coming in under Tier 2 must have a basic grasp of the language before they can come here.\"\nWoolas is responsible for the introduction of the new system, which is aimed at linking migrant numbers more closely to skill shortages. \"Elite foreign sportspeople, including footballers playing at the highest level, make an important contribution to the UK and that is why we want to ensure the UK stays open and attractive to them,\" said Woolas.\nThe old system, which had a bewildering 80 routes of entry, has been simplified to a more manageable five tiers, which range from highly skilled to temporary workers.\nHaving muscled their way past the 49-page application form, footballers from Argentina to Zambia will need to show linguistic aptitude at level A1 of The Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference.\nClassified as a \"breakthrough level for basic users\", A1 is the first of six such levels for reading, listening, speaking and writing. A Home Office official confirmed that the required standard includes the ability to introduce themselves, as well as asking and answering simple questions, but is nowhere near fluency.\nDr Jay Kettle-Williams, whose language school Polyglot Solutions recently provided English classes for 16 of Portsmouth's cosmopolitan squad, argues that A1 is not a high enough level for social inclusion. \"It's a basic level of language acquisition that we refer to as survival,\" he said.\nKettle-Williams thinks that footballers can quickly be taught how to communicate with each other, but specialist courses are not likely to be available to them before they arrive in Britain.\nThere is some concern that the A1 standard has limited value as a genuine test of a candidate's ability to adapt to life in the UK. However, sports bodies point out that a higher level could prove too onerous for players whose pattern of education is often disrupted by commitment to their sport.\nHigh-level transfers can also be last-minute affairs, with deals being struck right up to the deadline, and there are worries that players will not be able to sit tests in time. The FA has been in discussions about this with the government and an FA spokesman confirmed that \"they have been reasonably flexible in their attitude so far\".\nThe spokesman suggested that, in exceptional circumstances, a player who does not meet the language requirements could potentially enter the UK with a temporary work permit, and then switch to Tier 2 within 12 months once he has passed the test.\nAssessing the likely impact on transfers, Mel Stein, general secretary of the Association of Football Agents, is sure that concessions will be made and there will be room to manoeuvre. \"I would be gobsmacked if they stood in the way of an established Brazilian or Russian star coming into this country,\" said Stein. He is adamant that when push comes to shove additional dispensations will be granted to help the transfer of higher profile players. \"The rules may be more strictly applied to the borderline cases, but not to the big money transfers.\"\nIf anyone is searching for a role model to inspire players and coaches facing the test, then they need look no further than the man at the apex of English football. When Italian Fabio Capello started as manager of England's national squad he had only a faint grasp of English and famously promised to learn the language within a month of his appointment.\nAs he completes his first year in charge, his English has improved to such an extent that he now appears a master communicator compared with some managers who have English as their first language.", "International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday announced a downward review of its growth forecast for Nigeria\u2019s economy to 2.0 percent for 2019 citing decline in crude oil prices.\nThe IMF made this announcement in its World Economic Outlook, WEO, January update released yesterday, projecting that global economic growth will weaken to 3.5 percent this year due to the negative impact of the trade war between United States and China.\nThe 2.0 percent forecast for Nigeria in 2019 is three percentage points lower than the 2.3 percent forecast by IMF in its World Economic Outlook, October 2018. The Fund also revised downward its 2020 growth forecast for Nigeria to 2.2 percent. The 2.0 percent growth forecast for 2019 is lower than the forecast released last week by some the nation\u2019s investment firms and banks. Last week, FSDH Merchant Bank projected 2.48 percent economic growth for the country in 2019, while Coronation Merchant Bank and Afrinvest Limited projected 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent growth respectively.\nThe IMF also downgraded its growth forecast for Sub-Saharan Africa to 3.5 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, citing impact of softening oil prices on the economies Nigeria and Angola.\nThe IMF equally revised downward its forecast for average crude oil price in 2019 to $60 per barrel citing fears of softening global demand.\n\u201cCrude oil prices have been volatile since August, reflecting supply influences, including US policy on Iranian oil exports and, more recently, fears of softening global demand. As of early January, crude oil prices stood at around $55 a barrel, and markets expected prices to remain broadly at that level over the next 4\u20135 years.\n\u201cAverage oil prices are projected at just below $60 per barrel in 2019 and 2020 (down from about $69 and $66, respectively, in the last WEO). Metals prices are expected to decrease 7.4 percent year-over-year in 2019 (a deeper decline than anticipated last October), and to remain roughly unchanged in 2020. Price forecasts for most major agricultural commodities have been revised modestly downwards\u201d, the IMF said.\nThe IMF projected 3.7 percent growth for the global economic in 2018 but said this growth will weaken to 3.5 percent this year before rising to 3.6 percent in 2020.\nExplaining the factors for its forecast, the IMF said: \u201cThe global expansion has weakened. Global growth for 2018 is estimated at 3.7 percent, as in the October 2018 World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast, despite weaker performance in some economies, notably Europe and Asia. The global economy is projected to grow at 3.5 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, 0.2 and 0.1 percentage point below last October\u2019s projections.\n\u201cThe global growth forecast for 2019 and 2020 had already been revised downward in the last WEO, partly because of the negative effects of tariff increases enacted in the United States and China earlier that year. The further downward revision since October in part reflects carry over from softer momentum in the second half of 2018\u2014including in Germany following the introduction of new automobile fuel emission standards and in Italy where concerns about sovereign and financial risks have weighed on domestic demand\u2014but also weakening financial market sentiment as well as a contraction in Turkey now projected to be deeper than anticipated.\n\u201c Risks to global growth tilt to the downside. An escalation of trade tensions beyond those already incorporated in the forecast remains a key source of risk to the outlook. Financial conditions have already tightened since the fall. A range of triggers beyond escalating trade tensions could spark a further deterioration in risk sentiment with adverse growth implications, especially given the high levels of public and private debt. These potential triggers include a \u201cno-deal\u201d withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and a greater-than-envisaged slowdown in China.\n\u201cThe baseline forecast incorporates the US tariffs announced through September 2018 and retaliatory measures. For the United States, these include tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, aluminium, and steel announced in the first half of 2018; a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of imports from China, and a 10 percent tariff on an additional $200 billion of imports from China, with the latter rising to 25 percent after the current 90-day \u201ctruce\u201d ends on March 1, 2019. For China, the forecast incorporates tariffs ranging from 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of imports from the United States.\n\u201cThe main shared policy priority is for countries to resolve cooperatively and quickly their trade disagreements and the resulting policy uncertainty, rather than raising harmful barriers further and destabilizing an already slowing global economy. Across all economies, measures to boost potential output growth, enhance inclusiveness, and strengthen fiscal and financial buffers in an environment of high debt burdens and tighter financial conditions are imperatives\u201d.\nThe IMF stated: \u201cSpecifically, growth in advanced economies is projected to slow from an estimated 2.3 percent in 2018 to 2.0 percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent in 2020. This estimated growth rate for 2018 and the projection for 2019 are 0.1 percentage point lower than in the October 2018 WEO, mostly due to downward revisions for the euro area.\n\u201cGrowth in the euro area is set to moderate from 1.8 percent in 2018 to 1.6 percent in 2019 (0.3 lower than projected last fall) and 1.7 percent in 2020. Growth rates have been marked down for many economies, notably Germany (due to soft private consumption, weak industrial production following the introduction of revised auto emission standards, and subdued foreign demand); Italy (due to weak domestic demand and higher borrowing costs as sovereign yields remain elevated); and France (due to the negative impact of street protests and industrial action).\n\u201cThere is substantial uncertainty around the baseline projection of about 1.5 percent growth in the United Kingdom in 2019-20. The unchanged projection relative to the October 2018 WEO reflects the offsetting negative effect of prolonged uncertainty about the Brexit outcome and the positive impact from fiscal stimulus announced in the 2019 budget. This baseline projection assumes that a Brexit deal is reached in 2019 and that the UK transitions gradually to the new regime. However, as of mid-January, the shape that Brexit will ultimately take remains highly uncertain.\n\u201cThe growth forecast for the United States also remains unchanged. Growth is expected to decline to 2.5 percent in 2019 and soften further to 1.8 percent in 2020 with the unwinding of fiscal stimulus and as the federal funds rate temporarily overshoots the neutral rate of interest. Nevertheless, the projected pace of expansion is above the US economy\u2019s estimated potential growth rate in both years. Strong domestic demand growth will support rising imports and contribute to a widening of the US current account deficit.", "IT'S easy to sympathise with someone who has lost a child.\nBut an Ipswich orthopaedic surgeon says the true depths of despair are hard to explain unless it has happened to you.\nIt is a reality for Dr Michael McAuliffe after he lost his son Conor to liver cancer in 2006 when he was just three-years-old.\nHe had only been diagnosed 18 months prior.\nIt is that loss that drives Dr McAuliffe each day in his work with cancer charity Tour de Cure, which has raised over $42 million since 2007 to fund research for a cure.\nThe charity have partnered with Sony Foundation Australia to award three grants worth over $500,000 for projects using virtual reality to combat cancer.\nAs a panellist, Dr McAuliffe played his part in which projects would receive funding.\nOne of the major grant winners will utilise VR technology to traverse large groups of young people suffering from cancer, focusing on their specific genetic and biological information and comparing them to each other.\nThis will allow researchers to identify the unique genetic and biological traits that characterise each patient, and ultimately inform a clinician on the best possible therapy for the individual cancer patient.\nAnother major winner will use VR as a diagnostic and educational tool to create three dimensional models to visually represent what is happening within cancerous tumours on a molecular and mechanical level.\nThis research project will aid communication about rare cancers between peers, educators, students and medical professionals alike.\nThe development project grant will explore the possibilities to provide cancer patients with ongoing and readily available virtual psychologists and cognitive pain management therapies.\nThis will come in the form of VR psychologists and visual therapies, allowing a patient to direct their own pain management and empower them to manage their own therapy, in their own time.\n\"(The major projects) are designed to take incredibly complex information and the let the doctors see it in a way (they) can understand,\" Dr McAuliffe said.\n\"You can print up a three dimensional model of a single cell and within that cell see all the tiny little parts of how that cell functions.\n\"There's a practical difficulty for the doctor who is seeing the patient at bedside to see what the ultrastructure of the cancer is doing six levels below the cell and trying to connect that up to try and make the right decisions.\n\"Just because you've studied something for 20 years doesn't mean the answer always jumps out at you.\n\"(The development project) is to help patients to take that incredibly detailed knowledge and say well this is you, this is how it fits, this is the treatment we're selecting instead of this one.

Turn on the Fox channel and you can hear all the mean-spirited rhetoric, and how emotions run high about a much needed insurance reform that could give many Sharons one less worry in this treacherous world.\nGod save us from worse.\nRegarding the Jan. 20 column \"I'm Just Sayin': The necessity of health-care reform,\" whatever that AP-GfK poll claims, in some quarters, feelings against President Obama's health-care overhaul bill are still running high!\nTake Obama's guileful, out-of-pocket \"doughnut hole,\" prescription-drugs-cost-coverage-improvements bouquet aside, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chief Actuary Richard Foster projects that under the new law, overall out-of-pocket costs for various benefits including Medicare Advantage will rise from $326 in 2011 to a whopping $923 in 2017.\nIt would be fairer all around to repeal Obamacare's Medicare Advantage cuts and lift the annual payroll earnings subject to the Social Security tax in their stead.", "Porsche Cars North America (PCNA) is rolling out \u201cTech Live Look\u201d to its 189 dealers in the United States this week. It\u2019s an augmented reality system that connects dealership technicians to experts at PCNA headquarters via smart glasses for a live interaction that can shorten service resolution times by up to 40 percent. As Porsche is one of the two main wellsprings of engineering within the VW Group, if the system works without major flaw and cuts down the length of time an owner loses to service appointments, this technology will land in service bays for Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, and VW dealers in short order, cutting down service times. The whole point of buying one of these cars is to enjoy it, not have it sit for a week at a time in a dealership service lot.\nTech Live Look is an augmented reality system that connects dealership technicians to remote experts via smartglasses for a live interaction that can shorten service resolution times by up to 40 percent.\nVia high-definition live video from the glasses, the support team sees exactly what the technician is seeing. The expert in turn can project step-by-step technical bulletins and schematic drawings onto the display inside the technician\u2019s glasses, as well as take screen shots and enlarge images for better visibility.\nPorsche expects Tech Live Look to substantially shorten and enhance that chain of communication. A service technician at a dealership in my native Los Angeles will put on the ODG (Osterhout Design Group) R-7 smart glasses and connect through the AiR Enterprise software platform with the Atlanta-based Porsche technical support team 2,200 miles away. Via high-definition live video from the glasses, the support team sees exactly what the technician is seeing. The expert at PCNA HQ can project step-by-step technical bulletins and schematic drawings onto the display inside the technician\u2019s glasses, as well as take screen shots and enlarge images for better visibility. The technician can open and view documents while working hands-free on the car. This information exchange is far more efficient than sending electronic forms and photos or explaining complex technical issues over the phone.\nAfter successful pilots in 2017, the system goes live at three U.S. Porsche dealers this week. Porsche wants 75 dealers on board by the end of the year and the rest in 2019. Dealers began signing up for Tech Live Look in April, the same month the system won a Best-in-Class Award from the annual Field Service USA conference.\nAnyone who has owned a high-performance car knows that complex service issues can keep a car at the dealership for many days or even a full week, with intervention from regional tech managers and no shortage of apologetic emails and calls from the dealership service writers. No one enjoys that. If this system works as intended, complex or unusual technical issues can be resolved as a PCNA technical support team gives direct real-time directions and problem-solving capability to the technician getting that cherished Panamera Turbo S or 911 GT3 back on the road.", "Super-absorbent cotton has long been the favorite fabric. Long-fibered Egyptian cottons and Pima varieties, grown in the American Southwest and South America, are preferred for their softness. Other materials include bamboo silk and man-made microfiber. Organic towels made of pesticide-free fabric and dyes are easier than ever to find.\nBath towels can range in size from a 12-by-12-inch washcloth to bath sheets nearly 6 feet long. As a rule, the heavier the towel, the better the quality. Some luxury brands weigh 1.3 pounds or more.\nLast year, the Good Housekeeping Research Institute tested two towels each from 55 lines, washing and drying them 25 times. In the process, they came up with some great advice for buying a good towel.\n\u25a0 The No. 1 rule: Pick up the towel in the store for closer inspection.\n\u25a0 For a softer towel that lasts and picks up moisture, researchers found that the best bet was 100 percent combed cotton, with its stronger, longer fibers. Look for those words on the label.\n\u25a0 For softness, don't necessarily trust what you're feeling in the store: Manufacturers often apply softeners that will disappear with a few washes.\n\u25a0 Look for a dense layer of loops \u2014 you should not be able to see the base of the towel \u2014 which means more absorbency and higher quality.\n\u25a0 A great towel will feel heavier than it looks, meaning it has more volume and hence more absorbency.\n\u25a0 Double-turned, reinforced edges with double stitching are a key to durability. This reinforcement reduces fraying, which will give your towels a long life.\nTo care for your towels, Good Housekeeping says to check labels before washing. Take heed of warnings of no chlorine bleach, because bleach can weaken fibers over time. Also, leave out the fabric softener, which can add a coating that prevents absorbency.\nSo what did Good Housekeeping determine were the best towels among those it tested?\nOverall best: Macy's Hotel Collection MicroCotton Towels. Through May 15, they are on sale at Macys.com: $5.99 for a washcloth, $22.99 for a bath towel and $39.99 for a bath sheet, depending on which variety you choose.\nBest value: Bed, Bath and Beyond's Lasting Color/Pure Performance towels, $3.99 to $5.99.

Picture for Peter Hill machinery story.\nHome-made conversions have been seen before, notably in the Netherlands where farmers and contractors seem keener than most to spend a lot of money on bespoke machines to help protect their soils.\nBut now Claas has become the first mainstream manufacturer to produce a factory-built option in the shape of a Terra Trac system for the Jaguar 960.\nCoincidentally, it is 30 years since the company introduced the first-generation Terra Trac design for Lexion combines, with subsequent designs benefiting from hydro-pneumatic suspension and 40kph top speed, the latter largely thanks to more durable traction belts.\nIn the meantime forage harvester weights have increased as bigger, heavier engines and more equipment have been installed to keep increasing performance and productivity.\nThe Jaguar 960 weighs in at around 13 tonnes with a grass pick-up of more than 15 tonnes with an Orbis maize cutter on the front.\nIt can be equipped with generous 900mm wide 38in tyres but that pushes its transport width to almost four metres.\nThis means 800mm sizes are more commonly used to make a compromise between compaction in the field and the ability to swiftly move from field to field on the roads.\nWith the widest \u2013 890mm \u2013 traction belts fitted to the Terra Trac version, the machine is no more than 3.5 metres wide and operators can get that down to barely 3 metres by fitting the narrowest 635mm belts.\nAnd they still benefit from a contact patch more than twice that provided by an 800mm tyre, says Claas, with a tyre pressure adjustment system for the rear axle completing a package said to provide the optimum in soil protection and mobility.\nA unique feature, designed to minimise surface scuffing when picking up grass, is the track lift mechanism, which raises the front idler wheel to reduce the contact area by about a third but still more than a tyre provides.\nThe Jaguar 960 is a mid-range model in the 900 series, powered by a 626hp MTU Mercedes-Benz straight-six engine.\nMeanwhile, a 24.2-litre V12 engine from construction machinery giant Liebherr powers the latest big-capacity forage harvesters from John Deere. These are reckoned to deliver up to 10% more output while consuming 10% less fuel.\nThey replace the current top-end 8000 Series \u201cwide body\u201d harvesters, while the standard line-up is expanded with the 625hp 8600 to bridge the performance gap.\nOn 710/75 R42 drive tyres, the 8600 and other models in this series are less than 3m wide.\nJohn Deere says they can be equipped with AMS precision farming system features such as forage constituent analysis and yield mapping.", "Byron S. \"BJ\" Long Jr. died unexpectedly at his Revere home on February 20.

He quickly replaced his then striking workers with a non-union workforce willing to accept his management style and pay scale.\na bad idea, the new Continental pilot group returned to the Air Line Pilots Association. Lorenzo clashed again with labor at Eastern Airlines in 1986 when he bought the company for pennies on the dollar during a strike. With Lorenzo at the helm, Eastern failed in 1989.\nIn the government sector the leverage against labor has always been the employee oath never to strike no matter the circumstances. City, state and federal workers all signed on to essentially the same social contract, one that often makes it nearly impossible for workers to bargain for wages or improved working conditions. In the era of Enron, concern about violating an oath might seem like a quaint notion to some. But in the 1970s, an oath was the accepted and expected level of conduct in government.\nOne federal employee union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (Patco), organized the majority of the nation\u2019s 14,500 air traffic controllers into a bargaining unit that called a strike some 25 years ago (on Aug. 3, 1981) against their employer, the FAA. The union sought better working conditions, better wages and a 32-hour workweek.\nContract offers traded between the FAA and Patco in June 1981 were eventually lost in history as strike plans were finalized. The effect of the Patco strike extended far beyond the nearly 12,000 people who lost their jobs when they refused to return to work without a contract; it changed the face of collective bargaining in the U.S.\nSome called the strike inevitable because of Patco\u2019s militant stance against the FAA; others called it bad timing. On television just a few hours after the walkout began, President Ronald Reagan gave controllers 48 hours to return to work or face job termination. Few did, and he fired nearly all the holdouts.\nPatco believed the nation\u2019s ATC system would grind to a halt almost immediately after the strike began. But the union miscalculated the stubbornness of the administration and the FAA, as well as their deep pockets, which could sustain the cost of hiring replacement workers.\nThe months of pre-strike activity gave the government time to plan for the possibility of a strike, including shuffling hundreds of military controllers to places they could be most useful. Many low-activity VFR towers were closed and those controllers were transferred to busier locations. Traffic kept flowing, albeit much more slowly than normal.\nTaylor said \u201cThe oath we signed was eventually ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court because of the no-strike clause.\u201d One source said Patco controllers were not the problem with the system, but merely the whistleblowers about the conditions under which they worked. Interestingly, a new controller\u2019s union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (Natca), was certified less than five years after the Patco strike, demonstrating that the root causes of the 1981 strike had not disappeared.\nBy mid-August 1981, the FAA had turned the strike into a system-rejuvenation program to hire and train thousands of replacement workers. It\u2019s tough to walk a picket line when few people notice. Ruth Marlin, executive vice president of Natca, said, \u201cThe world was a different place in 1981. Strikes were more successful. It was not acceptable to hire replacement workers.\u201d That changed in 1981.\nAlso working against Patco was the poor publicity the union garnered for its cause among pilots with a number of slowdowns in the years before 1981. Few people understood an air traffic controller\u2019s job. Reagan had many friends in the media and was still riding high after gaining the release of the U.S. hostages from Iran. During the strike Reagan wanted to exude machismo, especially to the 250,000 mail carriers who were testing the strike waters.\nIndependent film producer Stephanie Saxe, 13 years old at the time of the walkout, recently completed a documentary about the Patco strike called Blacklist of the Skies, referring to the banning of all strikers from any government employment for nearly 12 years after the strike. In 1993 then-President Bill Clinton issued an opportunity for the FAA to rehire Patco controllers. Of the 5,500 who applied, 546 were accepted.\nMorale at ATC facilities around the country is poor today\u2013even worse than in 1981, according to Marlin. Natca says controllers are increasingly treated as commodities. She says the FAA\u2019s current financial strategies are also shortsighted. \u201cThe FAA is looking only at ways to cut costs,\u201d to the exclusion of considering overall value. \u201cIt is important to have people who are futurists, people who can drive the technology,\u201d she added.\nDon Brown, a current controller and safety rep for Natca, said there is little institutional memory today from the 1981 strike. \u201cThose guys grew up hand-writing strips, working non-radar and working broadband radar. They watched the system grow and become automated. They knew the reasons behind the rules. They could look behind the technology and still see the fundamental logic of the system. For my generation, post-1981, it has never been more than magic. It\u2019s hard for us to remember in this day and age how sophisticated all this seemed in the 1980s before personal computers.\nTo many who remember the strike of 1981, the FAA\u2019s current stance with Natca about controller contracts is reminiscent of the environment 25 years ago, despite the fact that Natca has a no-strike clause in its constitution. The relationship between the FAA and the union is characterized by \u201carms-length relations, mutual distrust, sniping in the media and heightened tensions in the workplace,\u201d said Shostak.\nDid anyone learn anything from the Patco strike? If anyone at the FAA learned a lesson, they\u2019re not telling. The FAA declined requests from AIN to discuss the agency\u2019s perspective on the Patco strike or issues about the current state of FAA/controller relations based upon the experiences of that job action. Shostak believes the union movement learned quite a bit. \u201cA union should stay embedded in good relations with organized labor.\u201d Patco did not and paid the ultimate price.\n\u201cI think we look at things more broadly than Patco,\u201d Marlin said when asked what Natca took from 1981. \u201cWe are now externally focused.\u201d Natca represents other FAA professionals, including engineers, architects and aircraft certification specialists as well as 87 percent of current working controllers.\nAs one Patco member said early in 1981, \u201cA strike against the government is only illegal if you lose.\u201d There is little doubt too that 12,000 workers with the courage of their conviction violated their employment oath on Aug. 3, 1981. Diehard Constitutionalists might well miss the long-term message from 25 years ago; however, it is one that has come back to haunt the current controller\u2019s union today, as well as other labor organizations. An oath and a no-strike clause surely address the letter of the law but they avoid the spirit of that social/legal contract.\nThe ability of an employee group to withhold its labor from an employer dates back almost as far as people and history books can remember. Government employees gave up that right when they accepted their current positions, and Natca confirmed that \u201cno strike\u201d will occur by stating that in its constitution.\nEarlier this year, the FAA tried a previously unused tactic by sending the unresolved controller contract to a Congress so overburdened with other duties that it was a foregone conclusion that the legislative body would take no action. Inaction on the Hill bestowed upon the FAA the right to unilaterally impose the new agreement on the controllers\u2019 union.\nThe FAA blinked in June when Marion Blakey and her senior advisors decided to delay the imposition of the contract for now, suggesting that the employees must have some leverage. The question, though, is this: without the ability to withhold their services in some form and with the FAA already having shown the union the door in the current negotiations, do the members of Natca or any other government union have any power of persuasion over their employer?", "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The chairman of South Africa\u2019s ruling African National Congress was quoted as saying the state should take without compensation land from those who own more than 12,000 hectares, comments that sent the rand weaker.\nThe ANC\u2019s plans to amend the constitution to redistribute land have been interpreted negatively by some investors, who see them as undermining property rights.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Mantashe\u2019s comments represented official ANC policy. Four key party officials did not answer their phones when called by Reuters for clarification.\nMantashe is one of the top six most powerful officials in the ruling party and a close ally of President Cyril Ramaphosa.\nThe rand fell more than 3 percent against the dollar earlier, partly weakened by Mantashe\u2019s comments, a report by Moody\u2019s ratings agency on the struggling economy and a resurgent dollar, which struck a 13-month peak.\nThe ANC is under pressure to make headway with land reform ahead of next year\u2019s national election, where the ultra-left Economic Freedom Fighters party has made faster land redistribution one of its main policies.\nThe 12,000 hectare land ownership limit was mooted in 2016, by then-rural development minister Gugile Nkwinti. But Nkwinti said the government would seek to buy, not expropriate without compensation, land from those owning more than 12,000 hectares.\nAfriForum, an organisation that mostly represents white South Africans on issues such as affirmative action, has criticised the ANC\u2019s decision to endorse constitutional changes to allow the state to seize land without compensation, saying the move would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.", "U.S. education officials threaten fiscal sanction if intervention scuttled.\nThe U.S. Department of Education upped the ante in the battle over Baltimore schools last week with a threat to withdraw Title I funds from Maryland if the state fails to move forward with a plan to restructure 11 low-performing schools under the No Child Left Behind Act.\nThe department\u2019s position raises the profile of the restructuring effort, which put Maryland in uncharted waters as the first state to attempt to exercise the ultimate intervention\u2014a school takeover\u2014under the accountability provisions of the federal law.\nOn March 29, the Maryland board of education voted to allow the state to seize control of four Baltimore high schools and transfer seven middle schools in the city to outside managers such as charter groups, universities, or for-profit companies. State schools Superintendent Nancy S. Grasmick pushed for the plan.\nBut less than 48 hours after that vote, Baltimore\u2019s caucus in the legislature won passage of a bill to block the state from seizing control of the schools.\nThen, in an April 5 letter to Ms. Grasmick, Deputy U.S. Secretary of Education Raymond J. Simon issued a stern warning regarding the legislature\u2019s effort to block the state action. \u201cA [state education agency] that does not, or cannot, carry out its statutory responsibilities, particularly with respect to the accountability provisions that are central to the success of NCLB, would be subject to potential enforcement actions, including the withholding of [Title I] funds,\u201d Mr. Simon wrote.\nMaryland receives approximately $171 million in Title I funds. Under the federal law, if a school fails to make adequate yearly progress for five or more years, the state must convert it to a charter, replace all or most of the staff, contract it to an independent entity, turn the operation over to the state, or implement major governance restructuring.\nGov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, promised to veto the bill by the end of the session, April 10. Ms. Grasmick hopes the veto would be sustained despite threats to override it.\nIt\u2019s not clear how the federal penalties would be applied if the legislature succeeded in blocking the state board\u2019s plan.\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the consequence would be targeted to the district that is not in compliance with NCLB,\u201d Ms. Grasmick said.\nResponding to Mr. Simon\u2019s letter, Sen. Nathaniel McFadden, a Democrat from Baltimore, asserted that the legislature was within its constitutional rights in passing the bill and should not lose Title I money.\nThe Maryland bill would prevent the state board of education and Ms. Grasmick from restructuring Baltimore schools or removing any schools from the direct control of the Baltimore city board of school commissioners. The votes, in the Democratic-controlled legislature which would be enough to override a veto, were largely along party lines.\nBaltimore school officials fought the takeover plan, claiming to have been surprised because the city has been working on reform plans, particularly for the high schools, that were approved by Ms. Grasmick. They also decried the lack of an opportunity to participate in the state\u2019s plan.\nEducation observers said it appears that the state failed to smoothly handle the politics behind the takeover, resulting in the current political standoff. They also questioned if Maryland has a clear-cut plan for the schools.\nMs. Grasmick said that while the state\u2019s hands may be tied by the legislature, the state has the knowledge and wherewithal to implement a successful plan.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this experience with Edison schools,\u201d said Ms. Grasmick, referring to three elementary schools that were seized by the state six years ago and handed over to Edison Schools Inc. of New York City. She said the state education department has also worked closely with the governor to open charter schools\u2014an effort that\u2019s yielded \u201cexcellent results,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe would be very thoughtful in how we would do this,\u201d she said.\nSome lawmakers claimed that Mr. Ehrlich\u2019s support for the state plan was a politically motivated move in an election year. Mr. Ehrlich could face a challenge for re-election from Baltimore Mayor Martin O\u2019Malley, a Democrat, who opposes the takeover plan.\nHenry Fawell, a spokesman for Mr. Ehrlich, said the governor had absolutely no role to play in drafting the takeover plan, or in its implementation. \u201cIt is the state board of education\u2019s decision, and this is a bipartisan board appointed by Gov. Parris Glendening,\u201d Mr. Ehrlich\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Mr. Fawell said.\nNational research has found that state takeovers have not provided dramatic and consistent increases in student performance. For instance, a 2004 study from the Denver-based Education Commission of the States found that student achievement in schools often falls short of expectations after a state takeover. In most cases, academic results are mixed at best.\n\u201c[A takeover] really is a last recourse, and there is little evidence that state bureaucrats can do a better job of running schools than folks at the local level,\u201d said Ronald Cowell, a former Democratic state legislator in Pennsylvania and the president of the Education Policy and Leadership Center in Harrisburg, Pa.\nMs. Grasmick countered that Maryland has had a strong accountability plan since 1994 and does not always mirror national research. \u201cI feel we should look at the research, but that is not a prediction of what will happen here,\u201d she said.\nCloser to home, the Maryland Department of Legislative Services, a nonpartisan analytical arm of the state legislature, found in its fiscal-impact report on the bill that the three Edison schools in Baltimore have not performed significantly better than other elementary schools in the city.\nFor instance, in 3rd grade reading on the Maryland state assessments, 61 percent of the students at other city schools performed at the proficient or above level in 2005, while 63 percent of the students at the Edison-run schools performed at that level. But in 4th grade reading for the same year, 65 percent of the students at other city schools were proficient or above, while only 60 percent at the Edison schools were at that level, according to the DLS analysis.\nMs. Grasmick said that analysis was unfair because it compares the three Baltimore schools to all other elementary schools citywide, including several low-performing schools. She said results at the three schools, which were failing, have increased dramatically over the last few years.\nShe added that two of the four high schools slated for a takeover were identified as low-performing by the state as early as 1994. \u201cBut less aggressive, less creative, and less systemic actions have not yielded any results in those schools,\u201d she said, adding that more than a thousand students have dropped out, forcing the state to take more severe measures.\n\u201cState Steps in Under NCLB in Baltimore,\u201d April 5, 2006.\n\u201cMd.

Howard is the talented tight end who came into last season\u2019s title game with 33 catches for 394 yards and no touchdowns. He then went off for 208 yards on five catches with two scores as Clemson\u2019s defense seemed unaware that Howard was an eligible receiver.\nWhile it\u2019s safe to assume quarterbacks Deshaun Watson and Jalen Hurts will play pivotal roles in Monday\u2019s game at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla., you never know who will emerge as a star on the big stage \u2014 especially with the most talented rosters in college football facing off.\nWith the help of some coaches who have played each team and the scouting website Pro Football Focus, these are some of the matchups that could determine Tigers-Tide II.\nWatson is probably going to throw an interception at some point against Alabama. He has thrown 17 on the season after throwing 13 last season, including one in his magnificent championship game performance.\nThe junior Heisman Trophy runner-up is a confident passer who will try to make difficult throws. He is also able to escape trouble with his mobility and strength. Add those up and he occasionally courts trouble.\nAs everyone who has been paying attention knows by now, Alabama\u2019s defense scores a lot. Twelve touchdowns to be exact. Alabama\u2019s athletes are so crazy good \u2014 from defensive end Jonathan Allen to linebacker Ryan Anderson to safety Minkah Fitzpatrick \u2014 that they become dynamic ball carriers when running through fast guys who can\u2019t tackle and big guys who aren\u2019t fast enough to keep up.\nPurdue coach Jeff Brohm, who faced Alabama when he was coach at Western Kentucky this season and lost 38-10, said the touchdowns are no fluke. Most defenses provide some opportunities for safe throws. Not Alabama\u2019s.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to press you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get up on you. So there\u2019s not a whole lot of separation unless you want to hold onto the ball.\u201d And holding on to the ball usually doesn\u2019t end well against the best pass rush in college football \u2014 a pass rush that does not rely on much blitzing.\nTroy coach Neal Brown, whose team lost 30-24 at Clemson on Sept. 10, said Clemson usually tries to set up Watson for easy throws early in the game to get him comfortable.\n\u201cThey did a great job schematically of getting him into the flow of the game,\u201d Brown said.\nBrohm said Clemson\u2019s offense, which is heavy on misdirection and gets Watson involved in the running game, matches up as well as possible against Alabama\u2019s defense.\nAlabama\u2019s offense, with an inconsistent passer in Hurts, is not necessarily built to match scores with Watson. Clemson\u2019s path to victory includes forcing the Tide\u2019s offense to provide all of Alabama\u2019s points.\nWilliams, at 6-foot-3 and 225 pounds, gets compared to all those big, impossible-to-cover receivers that play in the NFL: Alshon Jeffrey (6-3, 216), Demariyus Thomas (6-3, 235) and even former great Calvin Johnson (6-5, 237).\nThe junior is Watson\u2019s security blanket \u2014 almost to a fault. The Tigers have so many effective weapons that at times this season they almost became too reliant on Williams and limited an offense that does so much well. Then again, it\u2019s easy to want to force feed Williams, who has the speed to get deep and the size and strength to catch passes when covered.\nPhysically, Humphrey is about as a good a matchup for Williams as you\u2019ll find. The junior is 6-1 and 196. His problem has been getting beat down the field. He has allowed 16.3 yards per catch this season, according to Pro Football Focus, after allowing 17.4 last year.\nThe Tide\u2019s pass rush is ferocious (50 sacks), but the Tigers get after passers almost as well (49 sacks).\nPressure has been a problem for Hurts. According to Pro Football Focus, Hurts\u2019 completion percentage drops to 31 percent when he is under pressure. Incompletions are not the worst thing. Better than interceptions. Hurts has thrown four of his nine picks when facing pressure, according to PFF. Hurts (891 yards rushing) can also turn a near sack into a big gain.\nSo Clemson needs to force hurried throws, but also be disciplined enough to not allow Hurts room to take off.\nLSU defensive coordinator Dave Aranda said Lane Kiffin, now the former Alabama offensive coordinator, turned the Tide\u2019s offense into one that morphs from week to week to attack an opponents\u2019 weakness.\n\u201cThe biggest thing with Alabama, you had to look at yourself before you looked at them. What hurt you in the past?\u201d said Aranda, whose team lost 10-0 to Alabama on Nov. 5. Now with Steve Sarkisian calling plays: \u201cI\u2019m wondering how much that changes,\u201d Aranda said.\nAranda said Alabama gets Hurts involved in the running game when defenses get overly aggressive.\n\u201cThe quarterback run cancels out a lot of aggression for aggression sake,\u201d Aranda said.\nThe Tigers got 17 sacks from tackles Carlos Watkins (10.5) and Lawrence (6.5), the 340-pound freshman freak. Venables is going to make it hard for Alabama to double-team the big guy.\n\u201cVenables does a great job creating Bear fronts, which, in a Bear front, all five offensive linemen are covered. Which creates one-on-one matchups,\u201d Brown said.\nThe good news for Hurts is Alabama\u2019s offensive line is as good as any in the country at protecting the passer. The Crimson Tide allowed 24 sacks, but that\u2019s a little misleading because it counts running plays where Hurts was caught behind the line. In 434 passing plays, Alabama allowed six sacks, according to PFF.\nBozeman is the rock in the middle of that line, a 319-pound junior. Guards Ross Pierschbacher and Korren Kirven will also get their chances to deal with the Clemson\u2019s man-child. In fact, don\u2019t be surprised if Venables tries to get Lawrence matched up on the guards who are not as good as Bozeman.\nAlabama is better than, or at worst equal to, Clemson everywhere but one spot: quarterback. Watson and the nature of Clemson\u2019s offensive scheme give the Tigers answers for Alabama\u2019s smothering defense that few teams have. But the combination of Nick Saban\u2019s preparation and planning and the most talented roster in college football means nothing less than another all-time performance from Watson will be needed for Clemson to win. It wasn\u2019t enough last year, and it won\u2019t be this year.", "On April 28th at the Armored Corps Base at Latrun, twin sisters from Long Island, New York will be promoted to Second Lieutenants in the Israel Defense Forces, after successfully completing the officers training course.

Uses a desktop GTX 1080, not an MXM-style mobile card. Quiet fans. Available as a bare-bones PC or ready-configured.\nPricey. Large external power adapter. No front-mounted HDMI port for VR headsets.\nStuffing a real GeForce GTX 1080 into a lunchbox-size mini PC isn't something you see every day, but the power-packed, costly Zotac ZBox Magnus EK71080 does it, and in style.\nThe Zotac ZBox Magnus EK71080 has lots in common with traditional gaming mid-towers: top-notch performance, good connectivity, and easy upgradability. What's more interesting, though, is what it doesn't share with them: a big, beefy case. This cube-like mini-PC (starts at $1,499; $1,799 as tested) is about the size of a lunchbox, yet Zotac still squeezes a powerful GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card inside. The card is one of Zotac's compact versions of the GPU, the same card you can buy on the open market, not a proprietary or MXM module. Designed foremost for gaming, the EK71080 comes as a bare-bones unit you build it yourself (adding your own memory, storage, and OS), or preconfigured like this review model, ready to go out of the box. Either way, this compact powerhouse will make you believe it's a lot larger than it really is.\nWhether you buy this ZBox bare-bones or configured, a Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor is included, built into the motherboard. As you'd expect, then, a specialized PC like this commands a premium. I configured an Omen mid-tower gaming desktop on HP's website for $1,339 with similar specifications, including a GTX 1080. The extra cash you'll fork over for the ZBox Magnus EK71080, then, is for the privilege of doing things on a much smaller scale.\nWith the Magnus, what you'll miss out on are overclocking options (the Zotac offers none) and expandability. On the latter front, the EK71080 maps out like a desktop-replacement notebook, topping out at 32GB of memory and two storage drives (one 2.5-inch bay and an M.2 Type-2280 slot). But if you can work within those restrictions, it becomes a whole lot harder to justify the bigger-is-better mentality when you can fit a GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card into a PC this small.\nMeasuring 5.04 by 8.86 by 7.99 inches (HWD), the ZBox Magnus EK71080 is easy to hide, but I'd ask anyone who wanted to do that a simple question: Why? The modern look of the ZBox's all-black metal case will class up an office or a living space. Demonstrating serious attention to detail, Zotac even put a blacked-out grate over the graphics card's exhaust outlet so no silver would show.\nExcept for the orange-rimmed power button, the outside lacks LED bling. I wouldn't complain if it had a bit more, but the simple lines of this PC work just as well without it. The less tech-savvy might not even realize the ZBox Magnus EK71080 is a computer.\nThe space-saving nature of this mini-PC is somewhat offset by its extraordinarily large external power adapter, though. The 330-watt brick measures 1.75 by 3.8 by 7.8 inches (HWD), several times the footprint of most laptop power adapters.\nThe connectivity lineup continues along the back. On the chassis proper, you get a quartet of USB Type-A 3.0 ports, dual Ethernet jacks, and the power-adapter connection, while the backplane of the GeForce GTX 1080 has an HDMI-out port, three DisplayPort connectors, and a legacy DVI-D port. The two included wireless antennas need to be attached to the two coaxial-style connectors back here for the Intel 3165AC wireless and Bluetooth card to have meaningful range. A Kensington-style security-cable notch is above the right antenna. Given the relative ease of toting this valuable little item around, you'll want to keep this PC locked down in a college dorm or public area.\nThe ZBox Magnus EK71080 is a part of Zotac's ZBox E-series, its highest-performing line of mini PCs. The Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor is the Hobson's choice in this model, as it's soldered to the motherboard and can't be upgraded or changed.\nTypically found in desktop-replacement notebooks, the Core i7-7700HQ has the muscle to handle any game or demanding task, including video editing. Intel has since replaced it with the hexa-core Core i7-8750H, seen in many of the very newest gaming laptops, but the extra two cores on the latter don't always translate into better gaming performance. Games typically prefer higher clock speeds over core count, and the Core i7-7700HQ has plenty of the former, capable of boosting up to 3.8GHz on a single core. Its base clock is 2.8GHz.\nThe heat output from the Core i7-7700HQ is the likely limit of what air cooling can handle in a chassis of this volume with this CPU. Zotac also offers a ticked-up ZBox Magnus model, the Magnus EN1080K, that upgrades the cooling system to liquid cooling to handle Intel's 65-watt chips (in the case of that model, the desktop-grade Core i7-7700).\nThe top of the EK71080 is perforated in a honeycomb pattern to maximize airflow, but most exhaust air comes out of the rear of the chassis, and some flows out of the left side. The fans seemed to be always on in my testing, although at a low noise level. The ZBox Magnus EK71080 is audible in a medium-size room under full load, but it doesn't emit a high-pitched whine or other characteristics that would make it a distraction.\nOur ready-configured ZBox Magnus EK71080 included a single 8GB stick of DDR4-2400 memory (a second slot was vacant), a 120GB M.2 Type-2240 SSD, a 1TB 2.5-inch hard drive, and a copy of Windows 10 Home. All were installed in the unit, making it ready to go out of the box. Collectively, they add $300 to the price of the bare-bones configuration, a reasonable price for those components. That said, it's an underwhelming loadout for a GTX 1080-equipped PC. The included 8GB of RAM doesn't quite do modern games justice; 16GB would make for a smoother experience, especially if you intend to multitask.\nUpgrading the EK71080 is easy, though. Flip it over, undo the four thumb screws, and you have full access to the storage and memory under the bottom cover. The fact that just one of the SO-DIMM slots is full means I could put a second 8GB SO-DIMM into this config with relative ease.\nThe graphics card is upgradable, too, but you'll have to disassemble the rest of the unit to get to it. On top of that, I'm not clear on how you could improve on what's in there already, given the space available.\nThe ZBox Magnus EK71080 was in for something of a wake-up call in the productivity and media portions of the PC Labs benchmarking round. That's not all that surprising, though, considering the mobile nature of its CPU and the fact that the competing systems here use a mix of desktop-grade processors. Although this ZBox is exceptionally fast next to the average PC, so is its competition.\nA 3,580-point showing in our PCMark 8 Work Conventional benchmark is excellent, but in this tough competitive set it's ahead of only the Corsair One Pro, a gaming mini-tower we reviewed some time ago.\nThe CPU-dependent Handbrake and Cinebench R15 tests show the relative limitations of the Zotac's 45-watt processor. Although the Core i7-7700HQ is a quad-core/eight-thread chip, it doesn't have the clocks to compete with the 65-watt, quad-core Core i7 chip in the HP Z2 Mini G3, let alone the 65-watt Core i7 hexa-core/12-thread CPU in the MSI Vortex G25VR.\nOn the 3DMark synthetic tests, it placed third amongst its GTX 1080-powered peers here, the HP Omen X Compact Desktop and the leading Corsair One Pro. Both competitors scored higher because of their faster Core i7 chips.\nLike differences followed in our Heaven and Valley simulations. The deltas in these 3D tests, however, aren't one-to-one with the relative disparity in CPU power between the units, meaning the EK71080's CPU isn't significantly limiting its 3D performance. Graphics-card oomph is king when it comes to gaming, and the EK71080 has plenty of it. Some games should prove that out.\nAfter that slate of graphics tests, I gave the ZBox Magnus EK71080 a chance to show its teeth in two real-world games, the demanding AAA titles Rise of the Tomb Raider and Far Cry 5.\nUsing the built-in benchmark in Rise of the Tomb Raider at the Medium detail preset, the ZBox Magnus EK71080 pushed 128 frames per second (fps) at a 1080p resolution, and a very playable 62fps at 4K. Those numbers, respectively, fell to 112fps and 47fps with the details cranked to Very High\u2014which is to say, not by a whole lot.\nFar Cry 5's built-in benchmark test proved more demanding. At the Normal detail preset, the ZBox Magnus EK71080 cranked out 85fps at 1080p and 46fps at 4K, falling respectively to 76fps and 41fps when we pushed the details to the top graphical preset.\nThis level of performance is standard fare for the GTX 1080, a card that's about to be replaced, or at least challenged, by the GeForce GTX 2080 in late September 2018. The GTX 1080 is still great for high-frame-rate 1080p or 1440p gaming, and it should remain so for some time. But it can prove a bit underpowered at 4K unless you lower the detail settings in the more demanding titles.\nA GTX 1080 in a Lunchbox: Any Questions?\nThe Zotac ZBox Magnus EK71080 stands out as one of the few truly scaled-down gaming PCs that uses a true desktop graphics card. Its significant disadvantages next to a traditional mid-tower desktop are its limited expandability (the 32GB RAM ceiling and the ability to host just two storage drives) and its use of a 45-watt mobile processor as opposed to a socketed desktop chip. The latter resulted in slightly lower benchmark scores than full-size, desktop-CPU-equipped systems with the same GTX 1080 graphics card, but the difference was under 10 percent in our game-specific benchmarks. You'd be hard-pressed to notice that in the real world.\nThe privilege of gaming on a small scale doesn't come cheap, though. The ZBox Magnus EK71080 commands several hundred dollars over a comparably equipped mid-tower. Sometimes, though, the space savings and the novelty of owning a desktop with this level of portability, stash-ability, and cleverly integrated design is worth the extra bucks. If that's what you need\u2014a packable power rig for all-out gaming or VR\u2014Magnus will bring the muscle.", "At 67 years old, Marianne Faithfull\u2019s career has spanned over five decades. Beginning in the 1960s, the English singer-songwriter has produced music infused with passion, but somewhat overshadowed by her tumultuous personal life. She is, however, in fine form over 40 years following her drug problems, as shown by the release of Faithfull\u2019s 20th album.\n\u201cGive My Love To London\u201d is a largely collaborative album. Faithfull invited several musicians to join her in the recording studio, including Nick Cave, Ed Harcourt, Steve Earle, Anna Calvi, and many others. The songwriting process for this LP seemed to once again be mainly a team effort, though most of the lyrics come from Faithfull herself.\nThough the album is an impressive feat for Faithfull after such a long career, it is not necessarily remarkable by itself. The entire track list is not fantastic, with only a few powerful songs that really stand out. \u201cGoing Home,\u201d written with the help of Leonard Cohen, is immensely captivating, laced with almost spoken words in Faithfull\u2019s cracked, raspy voice.\nThe particular genre of the album is hard to identify; at times, the songs are upbeat, load rockers where we can hardly here Faithfull\u2019s vocals. Others are soft, calm acoustic songs like, \u201cLove More Or Less.\u201d Some echoing piano, and a few banjos here and there, make the focus of the album questionable and a bit confusing.\nFaithfull\u2019s 50th anniversary of her recording career presents a good comeback that shows where she\u2019s been in the past, though it clearly emulates the messy and rocky road she followed to get where she is today. It is not particularly polished, but it is a welcome contribution from the legendary singer-songwriter.", "BREMEVERHAVEN, Germany\u2014Scientists prepared on Jan. 24 to embark on an unprecedented, years-long mission to explore the Indian Ocean and document changes taking place beneath the waves that could affect billions of people in the surrounding region over the coming decades.\nThe ambitious expedition will delve into one of the last major unexplored frontiers on the planet. Understanding the Indian Ocean\u2019s ecosystem is important not just for the species that live in it, but also for an estimated 2.5 billion people at home in the region\u2014from East Africa, the Arabian peninsula, South, and Southeast Asia.\nThe Nekton Mission, supported by over 40 organizations, will conduct further dives in other parts of the Indian Ocean over three years. The research will contribute to a summit on the state of the Indian Ocean planned for late 2021.\nThe Ocean Zephyr is preparing to leave Bremerhaven, Germany, on the first leg of trip.

The archipelago relies on fishing and tourism, but has lately also been exploring the possibility of extracting oil and gas from beneath the sea floor.\n\u201cResearch expeditions such as the Nekton Mission are therefore vital to help us fill those gaps and better know our ocean space and marine resources to make wise decisions in planning the future of our blue economy,\u201d Jumeau added.\nThe Britain-based Nekton Mission will use submarines and sonar equipment to survey depths of up to 6,560 feet once the Ocean Zephyr reaches the Seychelles.

Unfortunately, many athletes have no experience managing such massive amounts of cash, so they often become the victims of unscrupulous parasites or live unsustainable lifestyles that eventually wipe out their finances. Here, NewsOne put together a list of seven pro-athletes who lost their fortunes to frivolous mistakes. These players can certainly be poster children for \u201cLifestyles of the Rich and Stupid\u201d!\n1) How is it that an NFL rookie signs a contract in 2006 for $26 million then five years later goes reportedly broke? Vince Young (pictured) has proven that he possesses the financial savvy of a mental midget! Should we really give a boo-hoo for a 29-year-old bottle-popper who allegedly dropped $5,000 a week at the Cheesecake Factory and once bought all of the seats on a Southwest Airline flight because he wanted to be alone?\n2) Baller, shot caller Allen Iverson (pictured), who earned more than $154 million in salary alone and another $50 million in endorsement deals over his superstar playing career, has now fallen in to hard times. Reportedly, the man who was once referred to as \u201cthe Answer\u201d apparently doesn\u2019t have any answers as to why he is as broke as a joke. Iverson\u2019s high-roller lifestyle included excessive jewelry-buying and splurging on sponging relatives and associates. His chief downfall, though, was gambling. At one point, it was so reportedly extreme that he was banished from casinos in Detroit and Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n5) Who says male jocks are the only ones who make bad money moves? Marion Jones (pictured left) was a former-world champion track and field dynamo and B-ball player for the WNBA. Jones won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, for track, but after it was discovered that she \u201cenhanced\u201d her way to the top by taking illegal steroids then lying about it, she was stripped of all of her Olympic medals.\nJones, who was one of track\u2019s first female sports millionaires, brought in at least $7 million per year. Yet, she eventually filed for bankruptcy. The athlete\u2019s lies cost her to lose the $2.5 million mansion she lived in and other properties she owned wound up being foreclosed. The once-celebrated Jones found herself heavily in debt, battling court judgments, and entangled in a check-counterfeiting scheme. She received a 6-month sentence for perjury with regards to the check fraud case and for denying the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Liar, liar, pants on fire!\n6) \u201cRound-the-way boy\u201d Kenny Anderson was a powerhouse on the courts but a fool regarding finances. He earned about $60 million during his playing heyday in the NBA during the \u201990s through early 2000s, but it somehow turned into dust. Anderson allegedly loved to spend his money on items, such as pimped-out rides, and he also idolized the ladies. He has seven children with five different baby mommas and has been to the alter three times. He used to give himself $10,000 a month for \u201chang out\u201d money and would regularly dole out thousands of bucks to friends and family members. Shortly after he retired from the game, Anderson filed for bankruptcy in 2005. In addition to his spendthrift ways, divorce and excessive child support payments also emptied out his \u201cBig Daddy\u201d pockets.\n7) With 11 mouths to feed and 10 baby mommas to go along with the mouths, why wouldn\u2019t Travis Henry (pictured) be broke? Henry signed a $25 million contract in 2007 and had a base salary of $50,000 per month. The former NFL running back who played for three teams from 2001 to 2007, had children who were born just a few months apart. The player\u2019s eye-raising procreation agenda has cost him dearly with numerous child support disputes. In 2009, Henry was even placed behind bars for falling behind $16,600 in his child care obligations to one Mother. Travis\u2019 total child care support payments lie somewhere around an estimated $170,000 per year. The ex-Denver Broncos running back was also sentenced to three years in federal prison but served two for financing a cocaine-trafficking operation. This past summer, shortly after his release from prison, Henry was reinstated back in to the NFL. While he was handed down an indefinite suspension after his drug involvement, Henry now hopes to generate interest from an NFL team. Let\u2019s hope he stops generating interest from any more potential baby mommas!", "A visitor plays pachinko at Dynam's pachinko parlour in Fuefuki, west of Tokyo June 19, 2014.\nJapan spends $200 billion on pachinko, a vertical pinball game, every year.\nDespite a ban on most gambling, the industry employs more people than the top 10 car manufacturers and accounts for nearly half of the country's leisure activities.\nThe industry has long been run by Korean Japanese who have faced decades of discrimination and were unable to enter the traditional workforce after World War II.\nSome parlour owners support North Korea and reportedly sent hundreds of millions of dollars to the regime.\nCasinos have recently been legalized, but revenue estimates don't come close to pachinko.\nEach year, Japanese gamblers spend $200 billion on vertical pinball-like slot machines called pachinko.\nThat's 30 times the annual gambling revenue of Las Vegas, double Japan's export car industry, and more than New Zealand's entire GDP.\nAround the country 10,600 pachinko parlours entice players with rows upon rows of colorful and flashing machines. The aim is to drop as many silver ball bearings as possible into a middle scoring hole by turning a single wheel that controls how the balls shoot into the machine, before bouncing down pins that the house regularly reconfigures to ensure it always comes out on top.\nBut despite its popularity, pachinko parlours operate in a legal grey space. Gambling has generally been banned in Japan with only exceptions for betting on horse racing and some auto races.\nVisitors play Pachinko at a Dynam pachinko parlour in Honjo, north of Tokyo August 4, 2014.\nMin Jin Lee, the author of a historical fiction book set in Japan called \"Pachinko,\" told Business Insider that pachinko parlours use a loophole by having an intermediary between the winning of the balls and then the conversion into cash.\n\"Every single ball is equal to a certain amount of points and those points get redeemed at the prizes counter. Let's say you'll get a bar of soap, or lets you get an Hermes bag, depending on how much you win. But then maybe you don't want to have 10 Hermes bags, or 100 bars of soap. So you take your winnings and you convert it far away in an alley for cash,\" Lee said.\nThis cash exchange used to be controlled by Japan's yakuza mafia, but that has largely changed with Lee saying many places now just erect a glass wall between the prize counter and the cashier.\n\"You take your winnings which gets converted into, let's say, a plastic disc and inside there will be an actual amount of gold, or silver. So the thing itself has market value but then that thing, the little chip or the disc, gets converted at the cashier into cash,\" Lee explained.\nNearly half of all leisure time in Japan is spent in pachinko parlours, and the industry hires more people than the country's top 10 car manufacturers.\nOne of the biggest corporate operators is Dynam, which runs 400 halls around the country that are promoted as being cleaner and quieter than traditional parlours.\nBut parlours are largely run by Korean Japanese people, who pioneered the industry after the end of World War II. During colonial rule, many Koreans had sought employment or were forced laborers in Japan, and hundreds of thousands faced isolating discrimination when the war ended.\n\"The reason that the Koreans ended up in Pachinko parlours is because they weren't able to get jobs anywhere else, so it became a place of employment, a safe haven for people who could not achieve regular goals like being a postal worker, or being a truck driver, or being a teacher,\" said Lee, adding that many Korean women ended up working in Korean barbeque restaurants. \"Women go into food services, men go into gambling. And then, generationally, they become very important in this world.\"\nLee spent five years in Japan while writing her latest book about a fictional multigenerational Korean family, but interviewed countless Korean Japanese people, sometimes referred to as Zainichi, about their experiences.\nPaeng Yu Na, a high school student at Kanagawa Korean Middle and High School in her classroom in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, June 1, 2018. She is dressed in the school's uniform of traditional Korean clothes.\n\"I did not know until I lived in Japan that it was a business dominated by the Korean Japanese. It's also seen as very second class and kind of vulgar and dirty and dangerous business,\" said Lee, adding that these sorts of words and attitudes are still commonly associated with Korean Japanese, even those who have lived in Japan for decades.\nWhile many Koreans who originally arrived in Japan in the mid-twentieth century came from a united country, some do now support the North Korean regime.\nSung-Yoon Lee, a professor of Korean studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, estimated for PRI that pachinko parlour owners sent hundreds of millions of dollars to North Korea at the industry's height in the 1990s.\nMuch like Japan's population, the number of pachinko parlours have been shrinking. There are nearly one-third less than there were in 2005, and parlours are increasingly trying to attract younger players as their market rapidly ages.\nBut new laws have been introduced to try and limit players' addictions by cutting the maximum payout each machine can give by one-third, which means a player should never be able to win more than $450 in a four hour session.\nAt the same time, lawmakers have lifted Japan's ban on casinos. In a bid to tackle addition, local residents will be limited to three visits a week and will have to pay fees to enter, but it's still expected that casinos will rake in billions in profit and taxes.\nEach year, 1.5 million new pachinko machines are still sold to parlours, according to the Financial Times.\nAnd habits, even if they aren't addictions, are hard to break.\n\"One out of 11 Japanese people play it once a week. Once a week,\" Lee said. \"So it isn't like if you and I went to some silly place - it's not like Vegas where you go once a year or once every 10 years and say, 'Oh, I'm going to be a bride so let's go crazy.' It isn't like that at all.\"", "NEWS ANALYSIS: It is quite possible that there is no such thing as personal data privacy anymore--especially when it comes to video.\nSAN FRANCISCO -- A growing number of people think Facebook, other social networks, connected device makers--and potentially the entire internet of things market itself--are (or soon will be) too invasive into personal data privacy for their own good. This topic was one of many on everybody's minds at this week's RSA Security 2017 conference at Moscone Center.\nHere is one example: Recently in my own Facebook News Feed, the social network sent me a note that asked: \"Were you at Portola Valley Theatre Conservatory? Answering this will not post anything to your site.\"\nWhoa, wait just a minute. What is the point of wanting to know where I was yesterday? Yes, I've given Facebook permission to know my location, but I don't remember telling anybody that it was okay to track me from yesterday. By the way, I don't want Facebook to know where I'm going tomorrow, either. Is that coming next, using some predictive algorithm?\nBefore we go any further: Yes, I had given Facebook permission to know where I am, as I have with Google and others. The tradeoffs seemed okay with me, as they are for millions of other folks. So I'm aware that my location information was being used in various ways. I was just surprised, to say the least, at this use case.\nBefore I turned off my location option, I asked Facebook to explain why it did this.\n\"We're always looking for ways to give people a more relevant experience on Facebook based on where they are. For people who have location history enabled, we may ask for help to verify places where we think they've visited. People can see or manage their location history in their activity log,\" a spokesperson from the social network told me.\nI mentioned this concern to an expert in security and data privacy.\n\"Looks like they wanted you to validate their algorithm, so they can creep on you better in the future,\" Darin Andersen told eWEEK, tongue only slightly in cheek.\nAndersen is founder and CEO of Authenticated Reality and Chairman of CyberTECH Network, a national advocacy group for cyber-security innovation that includes the federal and state governments, the military, the startup community, venture capital companies and established security vendors. CyberTECH Network is affiliated with Cyber Maryland, a major Washington, D.C. cyber-security advocacy group. In his spare time, Andersen also runs two startup incubators, CyberHive and iHive, in San Diego.\nAndersen is concerned, as most people are, of the ever-encroaching way in which IT--in all its forms--is pushing aside personal data privacy. In fact, it is quite possible that there is no such thing as personal data privacy anymore--especially when it comes to video. Cameras are so cheap and being made so tiny, and networks are becoming so pervasive, that they can be bought and placed anywhere and operated at little cost. Video streams? Plenty of room in the cloud for all that content.\n\"We've moved from an age of surveillance to unfiltered footage of each of our lives,\" Andersen said. \"It's like 'The Truman Story,' but we know that we're in the story, which is different from Truman. But everybody else is monitoring us, and we're monitoring them. This is not Orwellian, because in my view, if I read (George) Orwell right--the idea that Big Brother is watching--that idea applies itself nicely to China. The watchers are watching the watchers. This is not Orwellian, it's something else. It's equally creepy, but not in an Orwellian way.\"", "Jack Sachs is one of the artists featured in \u0093Supernova\u0092s\u0094 screenings geared to kids and families.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine public art being anymore public than \u201cSupernova,\u201d the festival of digital animation hitting Denver this weekend. The event uses the massive, LED screens attached to large buildings downtown as its main forum. Eccentric and relentlessly eye-catching, the colorful, short projections are impossible to miss.\nThere will be plenty of them, about 138 works in all, according to fest director Ivar Zeile. The pieces range from 10 seconds to almost an hour, though most are about four or five minutes long.\nDigital animation remains a new and expanding field and most people probably couldn\u2019t come up wth a simple definition for the genre. Artists dig deep into their psychic imaginations to create moving imagery and, because their medium is digital technology, they\u2019re able to make just about anything they can dream up and program.\nSo, some pieces look like traditional, cartoon animation, while others rely on the manipulation of geometric forms. Some dig into organic earthiness while others travel into deep space. They can dwell on our primordial past or soar into the future. The can be narrative or totally abstract, though even the narrative ones tend play fast and loose with their timelines.\nAs technologists themselves, digital artists often explore the power of machinery, from futuristic factories to evolving robotics. But the work can be tender and human, as well, and is most interesting when it explores the connections between people and the machines they\u2019ve created to make their lives better. That can be pleasant, of course, or it can be menacing.\nThe form itself, isn\u2019t exactly new tot he city. Zeile and his team at Denver Digerati have been exploring it in small ways over the past five years. They\u2019ve been collecting works discovered on the web and commissioning international artists to make new pieces, which have been showcased during a series of \u201cFlash Friday\u201d events in recent summers.\nBut those screenings lasted about an hour each. \u201cSupernova\u201d will have 11 hours of concurrent programming, and will feature past hits as well as works completely new to local viewers. The fare moves fast, so audiences can drop in and out of the event casually.\n\u201cSupernova\u201d will use the LED screens on 14th Street at both Champa and Arapahoe streets, but Denver Digerati is also setting up a sizable 10-by-20 foot screen inside the galleria of the Denver Performing Arts Center. While the street corner locations are generally enjoyed while standing, the DPAC site will allow for more leisurely viewing. Organizers are suggesting folks bring lawn chairs. There are plenty of restaurants nearby to get a meal or people can pack their own version of a picnic.\n\u201cSupernova\u201d hopes to bring out a variety of viewers, including families who get a special program of kid-friendly fare at 6 p.m., and gamers likely drawn to a series of game-related shorts at 7 p.m. The fest culminates at 8 p.m. with a juried competition of new works, featuring an international lineup of digital artists.\nBut \u201cSupernova\u2019s\u201d scale, is also likely to get spectators who come across it serendipitously. That part of downtown can be a busy place on weekend nights with both pedestrians and cars already in the neighborhood, ending days of work or starting nights on the town. In the past, people haven\u2019t come out for Denver Digerati\u2019s screenings as much as they have simply found themselves in the middle of them.\nThe flashing screens with their fantastical images, stop people in their tracks.\n\u201cSupernova\u201d runs from 4 p.m. to about 10 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24, with digital animation presented on the LED screens on 14th Street at the corner of both Champa and Arapahoe streets, and in the galleria at the Denver Performing Arts Complex.

The now commonly embraced international target of keeping global warming at a maximum of 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u2014a hard-won, but politically negotiated goal\u2014is actually much too high, Hansen says, and we should instead aim for 1\u00b0C. That would be barely a blip higher than current levels of global warming (around 0.8\u00b0C), but still the highest level ever experienced over the 10,000-year course of human civilization. \u201dOur objective is to define what the science indicates is needed, not to assess political feasibility,\u201d the paper says.\nAs warming crosses 1\u00b0C, Hansen and his colleagues\u2019 research shows that additional heat is stored mostly in the deep ocean, where it can remain locked away for hundreds or thousands of years. (Water circulates very slowly down there). That essentially locks in further climate change, even if emissions are drastically reduced later on, because that circulating water will continually replenish the surface with relative warmth from below. Additional warming will also begin to trigger feedbacks (melting permafrost, thawing methane) that will unleash additional greenhouse gases and drive further warming.\nAs warming approaches 2\u00b0C, it locks in an additional 10-20 meters of sea level rise over the next few hundred years\u2014enough to flood every coastal city in the world. Ecosystem collapse would be virtually assured, as plants and animals that have evolved into precise niches over hundreds of thousands of years are forced to adapt to new conditions in just a decade or two. Even assuming we eventually stop emitting CO2 completely, reaching 2\u00b0C could, the study shows, mean we remain above 1\u00b0C for hundreds of years or more.\nThe study\u2019s key takeaway is that unless CO2 emissions peak right about now\u2014which they are clearly not doing\u2014in just a few more years we will lock in a 2\u00b0C rather than a 1\u00b0C temperature rise. That will set climate impacts in motion for the next thousand years or so, barring advances in technology that are currently largely discredited as either too expensive or too impractical on the scale necessary to reverse the warming that\u2019s already baked into the system.\nAs we reported recently, the UN has endorsed a carbon \u201cbudget\u201d\u2014a maximum of one trillion tonnes of carbon emitted into the atmosphere to keep warming below 2\u00b0C. To stay below 1\u00b0C, Hansen et al argue that the world can burn only half this amount.\nTo achieve this, they say, global CO2 emissions would need to peak immediately and decline three times faster than the rate currently being discussed for inclusion into the next global climate treaty\u2014a 90% reduction by 2030. The current UN plan (dotted line in the chart on the left below) won\u2019t even be implemented until 2020 at the earliest. Even if by some miracle Hansen\u2019s plan (the solid line in the chart on the left) took effect this week, he says we\u2019d still have only a 50/50 shot at staying under 1\u00b0C.\nBut the cost of waiting is enormous. If global CO2 peaks in 2013\u2014that is, sometime in the next week or so\u2014followed by drastic reductions, we\u2019re still locked in to climate change of 1\u00b0C or so until about 2100. If we delay this peak until 2030 (the green line in the chart on the right above), Hansen projects extensive climate-change impacts will continue for a further two centuries. If we delay until 2050 (the red line), dangerous climate change will be locked in until past the year 3000.\nThe inertia of energy system infrastructure, (i.e., the time required to replace fossil fuel energy systems) will make it exceedingly difficult to avoid a level of CO2 that would have highly undesirable consequences.\nHansen and his associates admonish the environmental community for doing the same things over and over again\u2014advocating for renewable energy, recycling, and hybrid cars\u2014and expecting different results. The change that is produced in this way is much, much too slow, they say. Their study concludes with what can only be characterized as a call to arms: a global challenge akin to the anti-slavery and civil rights movements, begging the world\u2019s young people to disrupt their governments and demand immediate action on climate change.\nAre there no other options? Hansen and his co-authors argue there is a sliver of hope the world could stay near a 1\u00b0C goal if there were a bilateral agreement between the US and China\u2014the world\u2019s two biggest carbon emitters. Such a deal would need to immediately implement a gradually escalating carbon tax, rebate the revenue to its citizens equally per person, and place trade duties on any other country not willing to join in. That could quickly shift the world to a low-carbon economy, perhaps with enough cushion to prevent the most dangerous aspects of climate change. However, the authors dismiss this possibility as extremely unlikely.\nAnother possible silver bullet, trusting technology to zap climate change via geoengineering (like sucking carbon dioxide directly from the air) is also a non-starter. Hansen et al calculate that the cost of immediately implementing free-air carbon capture, an unproven technology at large scale, would be around $50 trillion, though they admit that cost could come down a bit with future advances.\nIn Hansen\u2019s view, young people have the best reason to fight the system. He has said he quit his job at NASA so he could more fully embrace climate activism, including a plan to sue the government on behalf of younger generations for failing to act on climate change in time. (At least in the United States, trying to sue corporations would probably fail). He explained his strategy of helping youth fight climate change through the court system in a recent op-ed for CNN.\nAnd indeed, the US military already seems to be preparing for climate-induced mass protests, the Guardian reported in June, based on documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\nBut as with all revolutions, the fight for the climate will need a catalyst. It\u2019s unclear what that might be, especially when the very consumption culture that forms the bedrock of the present-day economic system is so ubiquitous\u2014and also at the root of the climate problem itself. Young people growing up now contemplating their futures may have the biggest reason for alarm, but with a problem like climate change that feels complex, distant and abstract, it may be hard to make the urgency that Hansen expresses resonate broadly.\nAnd even if a \u201chuman tipping point\u201d comes\u2014an Arab Spring for the climate\u2014will it sustain its momentum or, like most of the recent uprisings, burn out or collapse into factional bickering?", "Select Citywalk, DLF Mall recently.\nJamia Bazaar, a collective of women to showcase their talents in handicrafts and other artwork is to popularise the craft and culture learnt by special children and women from economically-weak sections of society.\nCEQUIN has been organising this event for the past three years at the India Islamic Cultural Centre, but this year the bazaar of 12 stores had been set up in the midst of luxury brands and high-end perfume shops.

Until the late 1960s, African-American doctors were excluded from membership in the American Medical Association and state medical societies, forcing black doctors to form their own medical societies and medical schools.\nNow, Gibson Fountain, also an OB-GYN, is the first female African-American president of the Michigan State Medical Society, the state chapter of the AMA.\n\"When my father (now age 88) was in practice, back in the day, African-American doctors were not allowed to be members of the AMA,\" said Gibson Fountain, a Detroit native who has been involved in the AMA and the NMA since she was a student at Wayne State University School of Medicine. \"I was brought up with Dad, who was part of the NMA and the Detroit Medical Society. The really cool thing about the environment we live in now is, although some things seemed onerous, good things happened.\"\nIn 2008, Ronald Davis, a preventive medicine specialist at Henry Ford Health System and then-president of the AMA, formally apologized on behalf of the AMA's board of trustees for the more than 100 years of excluding African-Americans from membership. Davis died of pancreatic cancer at age 52, four months after that speech.\n\"Part of what he did was historic and from that point I just moved through to become the president of the Wayne County Medical Society. It was a natural progression when I was asked to run for the president of the Michigan State Medical Society,\" Gibson Fountain said. \"I want to be an advocate for patients, to ensure they have access to health care, and I am honored to do it.\"\nGiven the history of the AMA, Gibson Fountain said she is very proud to become the first woman African-American president of the MSMS and only the fifth female as president of the 152-year-old medical society. She is also an attending physician at Beaumont Health with staff privileges at hospitals in Grosse Pointe and Royal Oak and at St. John Hospital and Medical Center in Detroit. She is the former chief of staff at the now shuttered St. John Detroit Riverview Hospital.\nOne of Gibson Fountain's top priorities is to make sure access to health care services through the Affordable Care Act is maintained. The AMA and the state medical society are opposed to proposals to gut Obamacare through the American Health Care Act, which U.S. House Republicans have recently approved. U.S. Senate Republicans have already expressed concerns with the possibility of removing 24 million people from Medicaid and private insurance as well as allowing states to determine whether people with pre-existing conditions pay higher premiums to stay insured.\n\"We need to continue to allow patients to have access to care and the coverage they need,\" Gibson Fountain said. \"We need to keep the 10 essential benefits in health insurance plans. We need to keep Medicaid expanded and the governor (Rick Snyder) helped us achieve that. We can improve the Affordable Care Act. But pre-existing conditions need to be covered\" at currently affordable rates.\nIn an hourlong interview, Gibson Fountain addressed other questions about her next year as MSMS president.\nCrain's: Why is it important that you are the first African-American woman president of the MSMS?\nGibson Fountain: Each president brings their uniqueness to the presidency ... Being the first African- American female president just allows me to bring my perspectives to health care. It sends a good message to younger doctors. I can talk about the fact there is such a disparity in health care. Detroit has a lot of health care problems: premature births, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, all are higher in the African American community.\nAs a member of the Detroit Regional Infant Mortality Reduction Task Force, do you believe the state is doing enough to reduce the infant mortality rate in Michigan?\nMichigan's infant mortality rate is 6.8 per 1,000 live births, slightly down from 7.1 in 2012, compared with 6.1 nationally and much higher in the African-American population. For example, 14 of every 1,000 live African-American babies born in Michigan die before their first birthdays, compared with 5 of every 1,000 Caucasian babies and 7 out of every 1,000 Hispanic babies.\nWe have a very robust infant mortality task force. The medical society and the (Michigan Health & Hospital Association) works very well collaboratively. We are doing a lot for the health of the community. But after initially funding programs to reduce infant mortality, the state has cut funding for it. We received only about one-third of the funding we asked for. The funding is not adequate for the people who are doing the work. We can do more.\nWhat are your thoughts on the state's new online prescription drug reporting system that is designed to address the still-growing opioid addiction problem?\nWe are trying to balance solutions for drug diversions. Doctors have to have the ability to appropriately deliver pain medications, but we needed a system to prevent abuses. The new Michigan Automated Prescription System has improved functionality. It helps us reduce workflow burdens and address the bad actors.\nYou are an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oakland University's William Beaumont School of Medicine. Do you have concerns about Snyder's efforts to eliminate state graduate medical education funding?\nAny cuts to state GME would be devastating to training physicians and would be problematic to increasing the number of physicians in Michigan. We need to fund GME and we need more residency slots. We are experiencing a decreasing number of physicians and will face a shortage by 2020. We appreciate efforts (the state Legislature made two years ago) to reinstate GME funding.\nHow do you feel about the state Legislature's ongoing effort to require hospitals to publicly report patient safety and quality information to a national, nonprofit organization like The Leapfrog Group? This year, the fiscal 2018 state budget calls for 25 percent withholding of GME funds to hospitals that don't report.\nThis is problematic to the medical society. We need improvements to address quality. There are different ways to report. I am for reporting to the Medicare IQR program. I have concerns about how the data is presented. People need good information (to make informed decisions on picking hospitals and physicians).", "[prMac.com] Odessa, Ukraine - CS Odessa publicly unveils the newly developed InGyre Technology as a core part of the ConceptDraw Office.

Pent up demand following the recession of 2008 and early 2009 led to a 25 percent increase in sales in the first half of this year, according to IDC.\nBut as the economy started to falter, some of that momentum fell with it. In a telling sign that sales would not be as robust as previously predicted, Intel Corp. recently cut its revenue forecast just a month after raising it.\nIn July Intel projected revenues of $11.2 to $12 billion for the third quarter. But on Aug. 27, Intel revised that projection with a forecast that revenue would be in the $10.8 to $11.2 billion range.\nSimilarly, IDC is now calling for an 11.8 percent increase in PC sales in the last six months of the year, less than half the growth pace set in the first half of the year.\nDespite the revision in PC sales growth, IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement that PC market looks relatively strong and should see double-digit gains. \"Strong demand, aggressive pricing, and active product development will continue to fuel solid growth through the next several years,\" he stated.\nIDC is projecting worldwide PC growth of 13 percent next year, and in the 11 percent range between 2010 and 2014. In the United States, growth will be lower: 10 percent this year, 9 percent in 2011 and in the 8.5 percent range in the ensuing three years.\n\"After several years of carrying the load in terms of shipment growth for the PC industry, the U.S. consumer market is getting fatigued,\" said Richard Shim, research director of IDC's Personal Computing program, in a statement. \"Fewer U.S. consumers are expected to update their PCs this holiday season. Fortunately, large businesses are expected to reinvest in their PCs over the next several quarters, helping to drive double-digit shipment growth in the U.S. PC market this year.\"\nMainstream notebook PCs will continue to be dominant, set to represent a 70 percent share of all PCs shipped by 2014, IDC said. Netbook PC growth will start to see pressure from slate PCs and devices such as Apple's iPad, IDC said.", "Supporters of right wing groups gather to protest in Cologne on January 9 over Germany's open-door policy for asylum seekers, which resulted in about 1.1 million migrants and refugees entering the country in 2015.\nRiot police broke up far-right protesters in Cologne on Saturday as they marched against Germany's open-door migration policy after asylum seekers were identified as suspects in assaults on women on New Year's Eve.\nShortly before Saturday's protest began, Merkel hardened her stance towards migrants, promising expulsion for criminals and a reduction in migrant numbers over the longer term to Germany.\nPolice said around 1,700 people attended the rally organised by the far-right anti-Islam PEGIDA movement, which has seized on the alleged involvement of migrants in the Cologne attacks as proof Merkel's policy is flawed.\nA police spokesman said roughly half of those at the PEGIDA protest were from the 'hooligan scene'. Some in the crowd threw bottles and fire crackers at officers, and riot police used water canon to disperse the protesters.\nTwo people were injured in the clash, and police detained a number of demonstrators, a Reuters witness said.\nPEGIDA, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, almost fizzled out last year when its leader resigned after a photo was published of him posing as Adolf Hitler. But its ranks have swelled as resentment spread of Merkel's welcoming stance to refugees.\nMerkel's remarks on Saturday were in stark contrast to her earlier optimism about the influx to Germany, which has taken in far more migrants than any other European country.\n\"The right to asylum can be lost if someone is convicted, on probation or jailed,\" Merkel said after a meeting of the leadership of her Christian Democrats (CDU) party that was overshadowed by the attacks in Cologne and other cities.\nOf the suspects, nine were Algerian, eight Moroccan, five Iranian and four Syrian. Three German citizens, an Iraqi, a Serb and a U.S. citizen were also identified. Similar assaults happened in other cities such as Frankfurt.", "AN airline passenger is suing the federal government after he was stopped from leaving the country while an Australian Border Force officer confiscated his mobile and sent secret text messages on it.\nThe 22-year-old man, who did not wish to be named, has filed a writ in the District Court of NSW claiming he was falsely imprisoned, unlawfully detained, and harassed.\nThe statement of claim said he was held for nearly four hours at Sydney International Airport by officers who had no reasonable grounds to suspect the man had committed or intended to commit any offence.\nFairfax Media broke the story last year that there had been an unauthorised use of a passenger's phone by an officer from Customs \u2013 now known as Border Force \u2013 and the department had refused to tell the man what messages had been sent and to whom.\nLawyer Zali Burrows told Fairfax Media that sending texts from someone else's phone is an extraordinary breach of privacy.\n\"It is the unknown mischief of the text that is most concerning,\" she said.\n\"My client was upset with the way he was treated, they searched his bag, they went through his phone, he missed his flight and the next day when he returned to the airport, it was Groundhog Day all over again.\"\nThe man told Fairfax Media he was stopped when leaving for a holiday in Turkey and Cyprus to visit his parents. He was taken to a room where Customs and AFP officers were present. They took his phone and computer and demanded the access codes and then took his phone into another room where he could not see what was happening.\nDuring the time he was detained and searched, the man said he was asked questions about his religion, his family members, his young sister, his girlfriend, his employment and his travelling companions.\nHe was strip-searched against his will and by the time he was released he had missed his flight. After organising another flight for the following day, he was again stopped by Customs and called his solicitor.\nThe man's claim said he suffered great pain of body and mind and was deprived of his liberty, suffered psychological injury including nerves, worry, fear, depression and upset, was humiliated and embarrassed, suffered nervous and mental shock and anguish and was otherwise greatly damnified.\nHe is also claiming the extra expenses he had to pay to get another flight.\nSeparate documents obtained by Fairfax Media under Freedom of Information laws have revealed that it was a \"counter-terrorism unit\" officer that started reading the text messages on the passenger's phone and then responded to two SMS messages without the knowledge or permission of the passenger.\n\"The CTU officer then deleted those messages before the mobile telephone was returned to the passenger,\" the documents said.\nIn briefing notes prepared for the Minister of Immigration and Border Protection for question time last year, Border Force officials said officers had powers to examine certain goods carried by travellers and make copies but \"it does not include using the device or making any amendments to or deletions of data\".\nThe documents also revealed that the actions of the officer were reported to the Privacy Commissioner. However, a spokesperson for Privacy Commissioner said \"privacy complaints are treated confidentially. The OAIC generally does not disclose if a complaint has been received from an individual.\"\nThe incident was referred by Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young to the Australian Federal Police for an investigation into the actions of the customs officer.\n\"How can the Australian public have faith in the Department if its officers are behaving like this,\" Senator Hanson-Young said.\n\"Spending millions of dollars on new uniforms and guns for these ABF officers has clearly influenced the culture of the department.\n\"The same people who oversaw the disastrous Operation Fortitude in Melbourne have been handling the response to this case and, for many people, that will raise questions about the process.\n\"The Department needs to explain exactly how it dealt with this incident and what happened to the offending officer, so that the Australian public can travel without fearing that their private conversations will be interfered with.\"\nThe passenger only discovered what had happened when he received a letter from the Integrity and Professional Standards branch of the department, saying it was investigating the \"inappropriate use\" of his phone by the customs officer.\nThe letter, dated nearly six months later, said: \"This behaviour does not uphold the standards expected of our officers at the border and on behalf of the department and the ACBPS [Australian Customs and Border Protection Service] I apologise that it occurred.\"\nThe letter said the \"appropriate steps\" were being taken in relation to the incident.\nThe Border Force had previously refused to release details of the investigation to Fairfax Media, arguing that it could harm the effectiveness of the management of complaints; that officers would have significant reservations about raising issues and providing information to the Integrity and Professional Standards unit if there was a precedent of public disclosure; and that a reluctance on the part of personnel to report suspicions to report improper conduct would have a substantial adverse effect on the department to manage its personnel.\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said the incident of inappropriate behaviour was self\u2011reported to the Integrity and Professional Standards branch.\n\"The officer was subject to a formal investigation and was found to have breached the APS Code of Conduct.

What about all the other families?\" He then said \"F**kin' b*****s!\" and \"Rats!\".\nIn her victim impact statement, which was read to the court by Det Gda Eoin Treacy, Vera Hutch said she had the \"privilege and honour\" of being Gareth's mother for 35 years before he was \"cruelly\" taken away from her.\nShe said she no longer felt safe, and the defendants had \"destroyed\" her family.\nShe said she would never again see Gareth's smile or hear his laugh, which was \"contagious once you heard it\".\n\"Not only did you take away my son, you have taken away a brother, uncle, friend and most of all a daddy.\"\nShe said it was Gareth's son who would lose out the most, as \"his daddy had been cut out of his life\".\nShe said Gareth was denied \"the opportunity of watching his son grow up\" and he would never get to take him to his first football game.\nMrs Hutch asked the court to consider the \"magnitude and impact of the crime on her family\".\nSpeaking on sentencing, Mrs Hutch told the court: \"Considering the violent and callous nature of this crime, and the little value of life, a maximum sentence should be served.\n\"Any time incarcerated is nothing compared to what my family will experience for a lifetime.\"\nMr Justice Tony Hunt said the three defendants had all been found guilty of murder and the court had no choice but to impose the mandatory life sentence.\nHe said Regina Keogh was guilty due to her \"involvement with her brother's affairs\" and it was \"reprehensible\" of Jonathan Keogh to involve her in the murder.\nRegina Keogh was in a very \"unfortunate\" position to receive the same sentence as her co-accused, said the judge, because she had previously led a blameless life.\nHe said she had also been a good friend to key prosecution witness, Mary McDonnell.\nHowever, Mr Justice Hunt said it was \"easy\" to be convicted of murder in the way the offence was defined in this country.\n\"All it takes is one contribution and that's enough. Hers is a sad illustration of that,\" he said.\nMr Justice Hunt expressed his condolences to Gareth Hutch's family, adding that his murder had been seen and heard in \"technicolor\" and it was \"hard not to be struck by the depravity of what was seen on CCTV\".\nHe also complimented the garda investigation, though he said that gardai were \"only as good as the community that supports them\".\nSpeaking outside the Criminal Courts of Justice after the verdict, Assistant Commissioner Pat Leahy said gardai took no satisfaction from what had happened in court.\n\"A really strong message came out from the court in respect of some of the people who were convicted. We had a mother of five children convicted, and gardai take no satisfaction from something like that,\" he said.\n\"We have sent out this message previously. You cannot get involved with these feuds, even on the periphery, and I think the court came out very strongly about that.\n\"It equally came out strong that gardai on their own didn't do this. All the communities came together in relation to this and the assistance we got in the north inner city.\"\nMr Leahy also ack- nowledged the work of gardai, saying it was \"an extraordinary investigation conducted by extraordinary people\".\nHe said 40,000 hours of CCTV were considered in this case and the investigation was not yet over.\nThirty-five-year-old Gareth Hutch was shot dead in the car park outside Avondale House in North Cumberland Street on May 24, 2016.\nIt was the State's case that Jonathan Keogh was one of the gunmen, together with Mr AB, who was not before the courts.\nRegina Keogh was \"central and fundamental\" in the plan to kill Gareth Hutch and helped to procure the use of protected witness Mary McDonnell's flat to stake out Mr Hutch's flat.\nRegina Keogh also gave surgical gloves to Ms McDonnell for the gunmen to use and arr-anged for money to be sent to her brother after he fled to Belfast.\nIn a lengthy judgment, Mr Justice Hunt, presiding, with Judge Patricia Ryan and Judge Michael Walsh, said the killing of Mr Hutch was not spontaneous but was \"deliberate and callous\" and involved \"considerable planning and co-ordination\".\nThe court found that the plan to kill Mr Hutch had been in gestation \"perhaps as far back as April 2016\", when a black BMW - the proposed getaway vehicle - was bought for cash.\nIt was certainly in place by May 18 when Jonathan Keogh acquired a burner phone, the judges found.\nMr Justice Hunt said the court accepted the evidence of Ms McDonnell, who identified Jonathan Keogh as one of two men in her flat on the morning of the shooting.\nThe court found that Jonathan Keogh was connected to the murder through the mobile phone and CCTV evidence.\nMr Justice Hunt also said Jonathan Keogh was connected to the proposed getaway car parked at Avondale House, through CCTV footage and his DNA, which was found on items in the car.\nThe judge said the association of Jonathan to the BMW provided \"powerful evidence implicating him in the planning of the murder\".\nFinding him guilty, Mr Justice Hunt said the evidence showed that Jonathan Keogh \"had a hand in almost every aspect\" of the planning of this \"murder enterprise\".\nIn relation to Fox, the judges found he was \"very much subordinate\" to Jonathan Keogh and \"acted under his general influence and direction\".\nThe judges accepted that Fox had some \"second thoughts\" about getting involved, but these were not \"clearly formed, communicated or acted upon\".\nAs Fox was found guilty, a person in the public gallery shouted \"You f**king hypocrite, you are!\" and stormed out of court.\nFox was also found guilty of possessing a handgun at Avondale House on the day before the shooting.\nIn relation to Regina Keogh's finding of guilt, Mr Justice Hunt said the court was satisfied that when she brought the gloves to Ms McDonnell's flat, she had \"specific knowledge that something was afoot in relation to Gareth Hutch\".\nHer behaviour after the murder also showed \"her continuing willingness to assist her brother\", the court heard.\nShe was guilty due to her \"involvement with her brother's affairs\".", "A miscalculation initially pegged the August inflation rate at a higher 6.6 percent year-on-year, but was spotted early on and corrected by authorities.\nSocioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto M.

The statistics agency did not take into account the free tuition scheme now being implemented in state universities and colleges, he said.\nFollowing a correction of the computation, the government later on reported that the rate of increase in prices of basic goods and services surged 6.4 percent year-on-year, the fastest in over nine years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal that the PSA\u2019s first data releases are preliminary\u2014in effect, subject to revisions. This applies to national income accounts such as gross domestic product (GDP), consumer price index, producer price index, monthly integrated survey of selected industries and labor force survey, etc.,\u201d Pernia explained.\n\u201cRecall that the 2016 GDP growth was first reported at 6.8 percent, later revised to 6.9 percent; similarly, first-quarter 2018 GDP growth was 6.6 percent, later changed to 6.4 percent.

What began last year as a joint effort to bring the public library's images to the web in a more organized and shareable fashion has finally become a reality. In conjunction with Flickr's new program called The Commons, the Library of Congress has added about 3,000 of its millions of photos to Flickr albums so far (see it here). Man, that's a lot of work left to do, though.\nFlickr's Commons program is in fact a sector of the photo-sharing network that's dedicated to helping public institutions get a better online presence in regards to their images. But a very central goal for The Commons is the leveraging of the larger user base to help organize all of these photos, by way of tag words and comments. When it comes to web media, its this meta-data that makes the content richer and more valuable. And that's exactly what the Library of Congress is hoping for: help organizing all those millions of digital images. Is this also a way the government can become more involved with web 2.0? Will I be able to add the Library of Congress as one of my Plaxo friends and stay caught up on its photo stream? I don't see the harm in that!\nI'm also curious about the Library of Congress' hopes for growth beyond Flickr: will this be the base relationship with a web company or the purpose of establishing a more accessible and mainstream persona, or will we be seeing a Photobucket photo stream in the future as well?\nWhat I'm more interested in, that would also speak to the Library's entrant into the world of web 2.0, is in what capacity the Library is hoping to spread its image content across the Internet? Aside from getting users to tag all the images, the other great potential is of course the shareable power of utilizing a platform such as Flickr. Kaltura is already working with library institutions for this purpose, presenting an application for users to have the library's image content available for mashups, which can be shared across various platforms present on the web.", "It's difficult to determine exactly how many people will be in town for President-elect Barack Obama's inauguration, and planners have backed away from the initial estimates of 4 million, saying that they now expect no more than 2 million.\nThe National Park Service no longer keeps track of such numbers, but the largest crowd ever in the city is widely thought to be that for the 1965 inauguration of President Lyndon Johnson. That drew an estimated 1.2 million people, and it was before Washington had a subway system.\nNo matter the numbers, though, throngs of people will be trying to get to and from the same place, all at the same time. Most streets will be closed to cars south of K Street Northwest in downtown Washington, from the White House to the Capitol. Taxis will be allowed to travel over the bridges that are closed to private cars, but they won't be able to enter the secure areas that are closed to all traffic in downtown Washington. People who live or work in the capital city also must get around, with the same restrictions faced by those attending the inaugural events.\n\"It's safe to say this is going to be a monumental challenge for the region and our transportation resources,\" said Steven Taubenkibel, a spokesman for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.\nBill Line of the National Park Service has this advice: Wear comfortable footwear and prepare to spend the day hoofing it.\n\"From a strictly practical standpoint, people should be well-prepared to walk,\" Line said. \"And you should be prepared to stand for long periods.\"\nThe Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies has 240,000 tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. The committee estimates that another 1 million or more people are planning to watch the inauguration on giant television screens on the National Mall between 4th Street Northwest, near the Capitol, and the Lincoln Memorial at the other end of the mall. Hundreds of thousands more are expected to attend the inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest to the White House.\nAbout 1,600 tour buses already are registered for special parking areas. Tangherlini expects thousands more, and urges people who are arriving by private coaches to make sure that their bus drivers have registered with the city for designated parking places. Many who do so will get spots near RFK Stadium; from there travelers will have free shuttle service for the three-mile drive to the mall.\nTaubenkibel suggests that people who are staying or live within a two-mile radius of the events plan to walk if they're attending the inauguration or the parade. They also might want to consider taking a Metrobus, since many streets will be closed and driving or parking simply won't be an option, although most suburban Metro stations will have $4 parking available.\nCity buses will have access to closed-off streets. The buses will be treated as VIPs, Tangherlini said, \"like the president's limo.\"\nThe transit agency has established special bus routes and lanes to bring people to and take them from the city for the events. To plan bus trips, check the Metro Web site.\nOn Inauguration Day, the subway lines will operate with rush-hour frequency from 4 a.m. to 9 p.m., and will stay open for two extra hours, until 2 a.m. Wednesday. However, it's clear that the subway system won't be able to accommodate everyone, Taubenkibel said. Even operating at its peak, the Metro will be able to carry only 120,000 people an hour systemwide. From the system's opening at 4 a.m. until noon on Inauguration Day, that's only 960,000 people.\nAt its peak, the most passengers that the Metro system has ever handled in one day is 854,638 last July, when commuters jammed the system on an especially hot day.\nThe Metro system does have experience with big events, such as after Nationals baseball games, the annual Fourth of July fireworks celebration on the mall and the crowds that throng the Tidal Basin when cherry blossoms are in bloom each spring. However, even then, people have to wait in line outside Metro stations to get on trains once the events conclude.\n\"People need to be prepared to be standing for hours on end,\" Taubenkibel said. \"People should expect consecutive hours of extremely crowded trains, packed liked sardines, standing shoulder to shoulder, nose to nose and ear to ear with someone you've never met before.\"\nHe warns first-timers not to worry about transferring to other Metro lines on Inauguration Day; it will be too complicated because of the crowds. Instead, he suggests, get off at the closest stop to your destination and walk the rest of the way.\nOn the bright side, people who are looking for souvenirs of their travel experiences can buy Barack Obama commemorative Metro SmarTrip cards on the agency's Web site. Purchasing a SmarTrip card in advance, which can be preloaded with money to pay for Metro and bus fares, will save time.\nAlthough bicycles will be banned from the Metro and in the areas around the parade grounds and swearing-in ceremony, people will able to ride their bikes fairly close to the events. The Washington Area Bicyclist Association will have \"bike valet\" stations to the north and south of the festivities for riders to leave their bicycles, and it encourages potential riders to RSVP on its Web site.\nWhile people may stream in steadily in the hours leading up to the 11:30 a.m. inaugural ceremony and the parade after the swearing-in, organizers anticipate the most severe bottleneck conditions after the events. Taubenkibel suggests pacing departures. People ought to find places to have lunch and consider remaining in downtown Washington to visit museums or monuments before embarking on their return journeys, he said.\nSince the crowd is likely to be unified and probably will have what Tangherlini described as a \"pilgrimage-like quality,\" planners don't anticipate the types of problems with crowd control the city that has with protests, for example. He urges people to manage their expectations. If they do \u2014 and are willing to be on their feet all day \u2014 he's certain that they'll have fun.\n\"It's Washington, it's beautiful, it's your capital, it's an amazing event,\" Tangherlini said. \"It's one of the most important events we have as a democracy. It's a historic election, so I think there's a lot of people who want to come and a lot of reasons that a lot of people are going to come.\"\nThinking of riding your bike to the inauguration?", "The family abandoned the frenzy of New York City for a slower pace.

These films are the foundation of the entire company, titles that children of the 1990s and later know as untouchable classics, formed as much by their quality as by their studio-enforced legacy. Pinocchio. Bambi. Alice in Wonderland. Fantasia. Because these films were re-released in theaters multiple times, and then arrived on home media to become staples of most of our childhoods, it\u2019s easy to presume that they were all massive hits initially.\nInstead, the opposite is true: each of the aforementioned titles struggled to break even with their budgets, let alone turn profits. Though now they\u2019re hits, in the 1940s and 1950s, they only served to make Disney lose money. That financial consideration is worth keeping in mind especially in light of today\u2019s 60th anniversary of Sleeping Beauty, one of the studio\u2019s most ambitious animated films, one whose aims so exceeded its initial success that the studio nearly gave up on feature animation altogether.\nOn its face, there are obvious similarities between Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella; both were inspired by stories from French writer Charles Perrault, both feature willowy blond princesses who are eventually bound to wind up in the arms of a blandly charming prince, and both feature villainesses with the same striking facial features and even the same voice actor. Though the story of the young Princess Aurora, hidden away by her parents due to a fatal curse placed upon her as a baby by the evil Maleficent, is the stuff of fairy-tale legend, what made Sleeping Beauty so remarkable at the time was its animation style and presentation, which both caused the film to stumble initially.\nThe 1950s began very strong for Disney, especially compared with the 1940s. That decade was one in which the Disney animators worked on package films such as Make Mine Music and Fun and Fancy Free, while also being on the hook for U.S. Army propaganda for the World War II effort. The studio managed to stay afloat without making a ton of big hits, but just barely. When Cinderella opened in 1950, it was a massive box-office hit that served as a reminder that the studio could balance its ambitions with crowd-pleasing stories. The following year brought Alice in Wonderland, which was enough of a dud at the box office that, unlike other films from the studio, it wasn\u2019t re-released for nearly 25 years, and only then as a way to capitalize on the popularity of psychedelia. Disney\u2019s next two films, Peter Pan and Lady and the Tramp, were both hits, the latter of which became the studio\u2019s biggest success since Snow White.\nAnd then things went pear-shaped with Sleeping Beauty, the 1959 release that set the studio back far enough that it took Disney Animation literally 30 years to make another princess-focused film. From a budgetary standpoint, the animation studio was largely able to survive thanks to an animation process that fueled Disney through the 1960s and 1970s, known as xerography. This process, adapted by longtime Disney cast member and technical wizard Ub Iwerks, allowed animators to skip the hand-inking process and place a drawing directly onto an animation cel. Though it was first tested in Sleeping Beauty, the process was used to full effect in the studio\u2019s next film, the very popular One Hundred and One Dalmatians. What it primarily did was enable Disney to continue making animated films at a lower budget, because the high-budget days of films like Sleeping Beauty had to end. And Dalmatians, The Jungle Book, and The Rescuers were, for their time, big enough hits that the studio didn\u2019t hesitate to press forward beyond its fairy tales.\nIn 2019, it\u2019s hard (if not just kind of laughable) to consider the possibility of a Walt Disney Studios that wasn\u2019t always a massive, monstrous success. But such were the days in the 1950s; back then, the budget for Sleeping Beauty was a whopping $6 million. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s just over $52 million, whereas Ralph Breaks the Internet had a reported budget of $175 million. But in 1959, that $6 million budget was more than twice the cost of each of Disney\u2019s last three films; more than Alice, Peter Pan, or Lady and the Tramp. Sleeping Beauty was one of several underperforming 1959 films that caused Disney to report a financial loss for the first time in a decade, even as the company expanded further into theme parks with Disneyland\u2019s continued success.\nWhat does work in Sleeping Beauty works so well, and only grows in power over time. The film\u2019s animation remains striking and painterly 60 years later, having been heavily inspired by Medieval imagery as well as Art Deco designs. The characters, from the trio of fairies to Aurora and Maleficent, often feel as if they\u2019re figures truly superimposed on the lush, colorful, widescreen backgrounds. It\u2019s an expanded version of what Disney\u2019s multiplane camera accomplished in the 1930s and 1940s, where the filmmakers would move past and through different layers of artwork at different speeds to suggest deeper more dimensional movement. The way that Sleeping Beauty utilizes this unique effect is what makes the Sleeping Beauty Castle Walkthrough attraction in Disneyland so fascinating; you walk through various dioramas of scenes from the film, calling to mind the experience of watching it.\nDesigner Eyvind Earle was instrumental to the way Sleeping Beauty looks, compared to the much more familiar visions evinced in Cinderella and Snow White. It\u2019s little wonder that many of the animators on the film, including some of Disney\u2019s fabled Nine Old Men and even the director, Clyde Geronimi, grew frustrated with Earle\u2019s heavily stylized backgrounds, which set the template for the events happening upon those backgrounds. Geronimi, in later years, argued that it felt as if the backgrounds took precedent over the characters themselves. Coincidentally, Earle, credited for \u201cColor Styling\u201d, left Disney a year before the release of Sleeping Beauty, allowing Geronimi the chance to dilute his backgrounds slightly. It\u2019s a little wild to consider, then, that Sleeping Beauty represents an even mildly diminished version of what Earle was trying to accomplish because it\u2019s remarkable.", "RUSH: Holy cow, folks. Did Beto O\u2019Rourke sandbag everybody over the weekend, including the Democrats. What a huge sandbag. He just brought them to a screeching halt today. See, I\u2019m of the belief that the Democrat Party, whoever it is that runs the Democrat Party now, or a majority of the Democrat base, simply does not want a white male as the nominee. But they also want to beat Trump, so when it comes down to it they\u2019ll probably opt for that. But a white male, and the two white males that are leading the race are Crazy Bernie and Beto O\u2019Rourke.\nNow, Beto, after his gigantic rollout last week, had his first 24 hours of fundraising and he didn\u2019t tell anybody what it was. He refused to announce the figure, the dollar figure, and so people began to speculate, \u201cMan, it must have been bad. It must have bombed out or else Beto would be out there pulleying it all over the place.\u201d So Beto lets everybody think over the weekend that his rollout was a bomb, and then he announced today that in his first 24 hours he raised $6.1 million.\nDo you know what the expectation was? Since Kamala Harris raised somewhere in the neighborhood of one-and-a-half, anything above that would have been considered good. Crazy Bernie raised $5.9 million in his first 24 hours. So Beto came out, he smoked everybody while letting them think over the weekend that he may have fizzled. And so today Beto owns the news cycle.\nRUSH: The Beto O\u2019Rourke headline.

Beto turned his wife into nothing more than a white slave. He\u2019s a misogynist, he\u2019s a sexist, he\u2019s out there moving his life forward while his wife is doing the drudgery of raising the kids, and he was laughing about it. That\u2019s how they saw it.\nSo he had to apologize for this joke, which was a self-deprecating joke. It was a compliment to his wife. But these clowns don\u2019t see it this way. And then he had to say: You\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, I have benefited from white privilege, damn right, I\u2019m guilty.

Because there\u2019s a part of me, I just can\u2019t see the Democrats, after all that we\u2019ve heard about the past two years, nominating a white male as the nominee?\nCrazy Bernie, Beto O\u2019Rourke, if they do that, do you realize how much \u2014 there\u2019s already anger at Beto for getting in this because he\u2019s a white male and the Democrats don\u2019t need a white male. They\u2019ve already got one, that\u2019s Bernie, and they\u2019re gonna take care of him again. The Democrat base has it in their head that the worst thing they could do would be to nominate a white male as their presidential candidate. Now the three front-runners are Joe Biden, Crazy Bernie, and this guy, Beto O\u2019Rourke.\nAnyway, Reuters had the story, confirmed by Beto. The Reuters reporter had the story, he asked both about it, Beto confirmed it was true, this guy sat on the story all during the O\u2019Rourke, Ted Cruz Senate campaign. It was embargoed. He said he was doing this because he was writing a book! This reporting that uncovered Beto having fantasies about running over kids with his car, he didn\u2019t uncover that as part of his day job as a reporter of the news. He came across this as an author, and therefore he was within his rights to withhold the story \u2019til after the election for his book! And then he wrote the story. Came out last week.\nI forget the guy\u2019s name at Reuters, but he\u2019s come under a lot of vicious attacks by some. He\u2019s getting praise \u2014 he\u2019s not the first guy to learn things in a campaign and bury them for a book later, particularly embarrassing things.\nBut when I saw this, folks, is when I first began to think that the source for this has to be Democrats who doesn\u2019t want a white male as their nominee. It was Reuters, which is a left-wing news organization. They had the story. They had the details on \u2014 and, by the way, Beto\u2019s fantasy about running over kids with his car is not the only thing embarrassing from those days.\nIt was a murder mystery. It was a murder fantasy piece that Beto wrote where the narrator runs over children in the street with a car. And it was last Friday that Reuters published this piece revealing that Beto was a member of the hacking group Cult of the Dead Cow.\nAnd I think he\u2019s saying this largely because of the experience with President Trump, a lot of things, like the Access Hollywood video didn\u2019t damage Trump, so a lot of these presidential candidates are thinking that the old rules are dead and that all this stuff in your past as a candidate is not gonna hurt you anymore. I think they\u2019re making a mistake because they still don\u2019t understand why Trump was not held to account on those things.\nAnd let me just tell you, Beto O\u2019Rourke is not Donald Trump. There\u2019s a whole story here on how this Reuters reporter uncovered this story and sat on it. What\u2019s this clown\u2019s name, Joseph Menn, M-e-n-n. We\u2019ve also learned that Beto has written poems. You know that Beto is a poet? I can\u2019t read this poem to you.\nDaily Caller: Beto O'Rourke Apologizes for Writing Fictional Fantasies About Plowing Children Over With a Car.", "What does this remind you of? A compendium of metaphors can help.\nAs a writer, I have no flair for similes and metaphors: Nothing ever reminds me of anything else. Homer might compare a warrior on the battlefield to a roaring lion; Robert Burns might say his love is like a red, red rose. I just see a guy with a sword or a pretty girl.\nBecause of the plainness of my own style, I am a sucker for sentences with any sort of zingy rhetorical flourish. \u201cFarnsworth\u2019s Classical English Metaphor \u201d collects hundreds of short passages from English prose to demonstrate how figurative analogies bring excitement, richness and increased clarity to a writer\u2019s thought. \u201cA metaphor,\u201d explains Ward Farnsworth, \u201ctries to create a little event in the mind of the reader \u2014 a mental picture, a surprise, a new idea, or all these at once.\u201d Most of this handsome book\u2019s examples are drawn from works written in the 18th and 19th century. Samuel Johnson, Herman Melville and, best of all, Charles Dickens are probably quoted most often. Given their extraordinary linguistic gusto, G.K. Chesterton, P.G. Wodehouse and H.L. Mencken are also included but no authors more modern.\nTo break up long strings of quotations, Farnsworth regularly offers brief comments of his own. As the author of \u201cFarnsworth\u2019s Classical English Rhetoric\u201d\u2014 a warmly received study of the patterns of prose \u2014 he reminds us that the strongest, most emphatic part of any sentence is its end. He stresses, too, how similes can often soften metaphors: \u201cIf one says that life is like a tale told by an idiot, the like provides a reassuring bit of insulation between the source and subject.\u201d In other words, without that \u201clike,\u201d an affinity becomes an identity, and a bleak one at that: Life really is a tale told by an idiot.\nLord, what I\u2019d give to be able to write like that!", "TORONTO \u2014 Vasek Pospisil has had a taste of championship-level tennis over his decade-long run on the ATP World Tour. He\u2019s ready to make a push to return to that form for what should be his prime years on the court.\nNow he just needs his wonky back to co-operate.\nPospisil was first hampered with a back injury in 2014 and the issue returned at the end of this past season. He plans to start training again sometime next month in preparation for the 2019 campaign.\nFrom 2013-16, Pospisil flashed some of his potential on the singles and doubles court. He reached the Rogers Cup semifinal in 2013 and hit a career-high No. 25 in the world singles rankings early in 2014.\nA Wimbledon doubles title followed that summer and Pospisil made his first career Tour singles final at Washington. The six-foot-four right-hander hit the No. 4 spot in the doubles rankings in 2015 and appeared to be well on his way.\nHowever, a couple of down years followed and Pospisil was forced to primarily settle for appearances in lower-level Challenger events or qualifying draws on the ATP Tour.\nThere were signs of optimism late this season though. Arguably his most impressive win of the year came last month when he topped fellow Canadian Milos Raonic in the round of 16 at Antwerp.\nThe victory provided a confidence boost for Pospisil, who has endured so-so results since his three-year run of solid play faded in mid-2016.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m playing better tennis now, believe it or not, than I was then,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cI just haven\u2019t been able to stabilize everything. My situation \u2014 be it the fitness side of things, injuries or coaching \u2014 it was always something that was not going in the same direction. It\u2019s very tough to get confidence or even momentum. You need a bit of luck and you need to also make sure everything is organized.\nThe back has been a problem at times in recent seasons and it recently flared up in the same area as the 2014 injury. Pospisil was forced to retire from his second-round qualifier against Benoit Paire last month at the Paris Masters.\nPospisil, from Vancouver, hasn\u2019t pinpointed an exact date to resume training but will likely take at least another week off. The upcoming season is also a big one on the Davis Cup front as Canada boasts its deepest team in recent memory.\n\u201cI would love to get back to the level that I was at for those three years when I was ranked 25th to 50th, fluctuating around there,\u201d Pospisil said. \u201cMy best years technically should still be ahead of me. I\u2019m reaching the prime of my career.\nPospisil, who won four of his six career doubles titles with American Jack Sock, has put the four-man game on the back burner while he focuses on singles. He\u2019ll likely pick his spots next season and would likely get the nod \u2014 if healthy \u2014 for doubles play in Canada\u2019s Davis Cup qualifier in early February at Slovakia.\n\u201cHe\u2019s really aggressive, he\u2019s not scared to go for it,\u201d said Canadian teammate Denis Shapovalov. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge asset that not everybody has. He comes to the net, he likes to finish the points. If he\u2019s having an on-day, it\u2019s super-tough to play against him. I feel like that\u2019s why he\u2019s so good at doubles.\nCurrently ranked 70th in the world, Pospisil earned US$512,000 this season to boost his career total to $5.29 million.", "Within months of McCrory\u2019s victory, emails show, the state election board began receiving requests for demographic data from a group of GOP lawmakers\u2026.They asked for statistics on voter behavior broken down by race: Who voted early, and who voted on Election Day? Who voted out of precinct?\nLongtime Republican consultant Carter Wrenn, a fixture in North Carolina politics, said the GOP\u2019s voter fraud argument is nothing more than an excuse. \u201cOf course it\u2019s political. Why else would you do it?\u201d he said, explaining that Republicans, like any political party, want to protect their majority. While GOP lawmakers might have passed the law to suppress some voters, Wrenn said, that does not mean it was racist.\nThis is probably true, but also spectacularly tone deaf.

But Nimoy himself never forgot were he first honed the skills that would eventually lead him to stardom: Boston\u2019s West End, where he grew up in the 1930s and 1940s\u2014and, more specifically, and significantly, in an institution there called the West End House.\nThe West End was a quintessential working-class immigrant neighborhood of narrow streets, pushcarts and three-story tenements. Long after he\u2019d become a star, Nimoy continued to consider himself a \u201cWest Ender.As he would recall for an oral history project, he named his house and boat in Lake Tahoe \u201cWest End\u201d. There\u2019s a great deal to be learned from his life in the West End\u2014that \u201cslum\u201d neighborhoods were wellsprings of the work ethic (his father ran a barber shop; his grandfather used leftover scraps from his job as a leatherworker to make wallets and small briefcases in the small apartment the whole family shared), and bastions of natural tolerance: Nimoy recalled the Italian iceman who spoke Yiddish.\nBut key to his future as an actor was the West End House, a prime example a type of an institution once common to American poor neighborhoods: the settlement house. Most often associated with Chicago\u2014where Jane Addams started the first in the U.S.\u2014settlement houses, beginning at the turn of the 20th century, spread throughout the country. Originally, as at Hull House or New York\u2019s Henry Street Settlement, they were places where affluent volunteers (the Teach for America equivalents of their day) would live in, or settle, in poor neighborhoods, to provide a range of assistance to the immigrant poor\u2014notably teaching English but also offering a range of youth recreation, instruction, summer \u201cfresh air camps\u201d and what we\u2019d called today adult life skills: from cooking and nutrition, citizenship classes and yes, even community organizing. (Jane Addams famously led a sanitation campaign aimed at forcing Chicago to improve garbage pickup on Chicago\u2019s Near West Side.). At Hull House, Benny Goodman was given his first clarinet\u2014and music lessons.\nSo it was at settlement houses across America helped lift the children of immigrants into the middle class and beyond through time-tested means: recreation, education\u2014and competition. What\u2019s more, the settlement house movement created what amounted to a national program\u2014it \u201cwent to scale\u201d, to use today\u2019s jargon\u2014without any act of Congress or federal appropriation. Settlement houses, in other words, actually won a war on poverty\u2014supported by local philanthropy, overseen by local boards of directors, staffed, in part, by volunteers. Would that we had such a national network today, helping to Americanize a new wave of immigrants roughly on a par with those who arrived a century ago.\nhe West End House, however, survives\u2014relocated to Boston\u2019s Allston-Brighton neighborhood, itself today a magnet for Asian and South American immigrants. Indeed, in 2006, Leonard Nemoy headed its centennial celebration.

Yes, feel sorry for political reporters.\nThe board is set for eight diners. There is a red-checkered table cloth, stained with the remnants of the months-long food fight that got us where we are tonight.\nThere are, mercifully, five empty chairs, where their former opponents for the Republican and Democratic nominations for governor recently perched and have now dismounted, after state voters sent them packing to political Palookaville.\nWell, at least Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim and Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton have runner-up prizes, wandering back to their respective city halls. The other dudes, like under-performing baseball managers, are spending more time with their families, at least until their next lucrative private-sector gigs are conjured.\nAfter winning the GOP nomination at the May convention and traveling around the state in a traditional campaign, then falling prey to Stefanowski\u2019s TV ads, Boughton\u2019s not happy that he lost.\nBut the year-long commercials, supplemented by the carving stations that the Madison business executive underwrote at his bash in Foxwoods Resort & Casino, worked their magic.\nThey allowed Stefanowski to avoid the state Republican convention two floors below, as if it were a roomful of inspectors from the British Financial Conduct Authority, which assessed Dollar Financial, his last company, $19.8 million in fines for gouging consumers who sold themselves away for predatory, short-term loans.\nNow, Republicans are saddled with the most Trump-like top of the ticket imaginable, with Stefanowski and Joe Markley, a state senator from Southington, as his running mate.\nA server, who looks a lot like Oz Griebel, the independent candidate for governor, arrives with dessert: a bowl of figs and pair of fresh public-opinion polls.\nThat\u2019s when I wake up.\nAs much as I like public-opinion polls, which are the lifeblood in the horse races for higher office, they should all be placed on double-secret probation after missing the big one: November, 2016, the election when the Trumpeteers came out of the woodwork to give our current president a multi-million-ballot loss in the popular vote.\nThat would kind of fly in the face of Stefanowski\u2019s vague grasp of state government and what a governor can do to cut spending on the way to eliminating the personal income tax, which currently raises about half the annual $20-billion state budget.\nThese private sector guys \u2014 hello Tom Foley, runner-up to Gov. Dan Malloy in 2010 and 2014 \u2014 doing the corporate thing, seem to have trouble translating the skills that made them millionaires to the government sector, where the point is to provide services, not turn a profit.\nThat\u2019s not to say that Lamont is any better prepared, with his public service limited to the Greenwich tax board and a seat on the state pension agency a quarter century ago. But he seems to have a grasp on the social-service goals of state government, and the role of public-service unions in the state economy.\nThe Quinnipiac University Poll, which gave Lamont a 13-point lead, finds that voters support raising the current $10.10-per-hour minimum wage to $15, by 63 percent to 33 percent. Republicans, though, lean against raising it.\nAnd if Stefanowski is going to hang his hat with Trump, the Quinnipiac Poll\u2019s finding that more than 58 percent of state voters disapprove of the president\u2019s performance, is telling. It\u2019s tough to win a statewide election with 30 percent of the vote, unless it\u2019s in a five-way race like the recent GOP primary.\nI\u2019m wondering if the Republican Party will live to regret not electing Boughton, a moderate, for governor, and New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, a 31-year-old breath of fresh political air, as his running mate.\nBy the time this bad dream goes down, on November 6, I hope the people of Connecticut find out what they need to be educated voters.", "Call it the blame game, and Baltimore County's chronic mentally ill are the losers.\nJames W. \"Jim\" Stockdill, deputy state health director, says the state has provided more money for mental health programs this year -- money for projects the county wanted. So, don't blame the state if local treatment and employment training programs can't be funded.\nCounty officials say the state's insistence that the extra money be targeted for specific projects is to blame for the threatened cuts in community mental health programs.\nThey don't blame County Executive Roger B. Hayden's cutting of their $2 million request for local mental health program funds by $871,000 because, they say, no agency gets what it requests.\nCounty Budget Director Fred Homan says the state has put the county in a \"box\" over the last few years by first cutting funds for community mental health programs, then increasing funding, but targeting it to specific, state-approved projects.\nThe county got caught in the \"box\" when it used county money to take up the slack for state cuts, he said. Now, he lamented, the county, instead of the state, appears stingy for not forking over the money the programs need.\nRegardless of who should be blamed, mental health advocates are worried that their clients will suffer because there will be less support for cheaper, community-based treatment for people who can hold jobs and care for themselves with a little help.\nDr. Margaret L.

The device, which comes with Windows 7 installed as well as an Intel Atom processor for fast Web surfing, will be $199.99 with a two-year contract. Customers can buy the device without a contract for $499.\nT-Mobile charges $60 per month for its data card service, which gives users 5GB of usage per month. It also offers a $30 monthly plan that offers you 200MB per month. Both plans charge 20 cents per megabyte over the respective caps.\nCustomers signing up for the 3G wireless service will also get free access to T-Mobile's hotspots around the country.\nThe new Netbook will be available in four markets to start: Dallas, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami. Other markets will follow soon, the company said.\nT-Mobile is a latecomer to the 3G wireless market in the U.S., and it's also late to the Netbook market. AT&T and Verizon Wireless have had their networks rolled out for years, and they've been selling subsidized Netbooks for more than a year.\n\"Even though we came late to the 3G, we are fueling the market with new products,\" Cole Brodman, chief technology and innovation officer said during a press event here Tuesday. He went on to say that the company was late to the Netbook market because it wanted to make sure the network was ready and the company wasn't certain that the earlier Netbook products were powerful enough.\nEven though T-Mobile has been late to the 3G party, the company says that it's leapfrogging its competitors with the latest generation of 3G technology, which T-Mobile claims is three times faster than current 3G networks. This latest generation of 3G called HSPA+was officially launched in Philadelphia last fall. T-Mobile has also upgraded its 3G network to HSPA+ in markets including New York City, New Jersey, Long Island and suburban Washington, D.C. The service will be deployed very soon in Los Angeles, the company.\nCurrently, the company only supports one device that can use the HSPA+ network, a data stick called the WebConnect Rocket. This USB device slots into a laptop to provide Internet access at HSPA+ speeds. It was announced at Mobile World Congress last month in Barcelona, and it went on sale last week.\nThe company said it will continue to aggressively expand the availability of HSPA+ in additional 3G markets. And even though it's still limited in the number of devices that are supported, executives claim that the upgrades to its backhaul and to HSPA+ is making its older generation HPSA networks faster because more capacity is available.\nT-Mobile also announced three new 3G handsets, the HTC HD2, the Motorola CLIQ XT, and the T-Mobile MyTouch 3G. These devices are all HSPA 7.2 capable. They do not have HSPA Plus technology embedded. New HSPA+ device are expected to be announced later this year.", "Staten Island prosecutors dismissed criminal charges Monday against a sickly man of short stature who cops handcuffed, punched, and zapped into semi-consciousness with a stun gun, according to a phone video.\nA prosecutor moved to dismiss the assault and resisting arrest charges against 4-foot-8, 85-pound William Colon, and a judge ordered them tossed.\nAs the Daily News exclusively reported, police barged into Colon\u2019s Staten Island apartment on the afternoon of Sept. 28 on a domestic violence call. As Colon, 24, begged the officers to tell him why they were there, they grabbed him and threw him on a bed, according to a cell phone video taken by his brother.\nThe footage shows cops forcing him onto his stomach, yanking his arms behind his back and handcuffing him. A burly officer named Vincenzo Trabolse then appears to punch him at least three times in his side.\nTrabolse also zaps Colon with a stun gun until he falls limp, the video shows.\nColon is afflicted with a range of health issues that he claims have made him frail. He says he has Mauriac Syndrome, an illness related to diabetes that causes dwarfism. He is also asthmatic, has curvature of the spine and an intestinal disorder. He does not work as a result of heart issues, he said.\nIn a statement, Legal Aid, which represents Colon, said, \u201cThis is a case that the Richmond County District Attorney\u2019s Office should never have brought. In addition to William Colon\u2019s needless interaction with the criminal justice system, he was also brutally assaulted by Officer Vincenzo Trabolse, an attack which could have been fatal.\nIn its own own statement on the move, the Staten Island District Attorney\u2019s office said, \u201cAfter a thorough and complete review of the evidence, we have moved today to dismiss all charges against William Colon arising out of the incident on September 28, 2018.\nTrabolse remains on active duty. \u201cEight body-warn cameras at the scene show officers responding to a domestic violence call.

Standing inside a Woolworth's five-and-dime one morning in late November, they gasped and sighed, pointing out items they recalled.\nThere was a large doll that came inside a small trunk. And a ceramic Christmas tree with multicolored lights, which Owens' mother had a larger version of.\nAnd a device with a spinning wheel and spotlight, which shines colorful, moving beams of light.\n\"We had that,\" Bossert said, gesturing toward the shoebox-sized contraption. \"My dad loved that, he'd get them from Sears.\"\nOf course, the women weren't actually in a Woolworth's store. The items spread beneath the glass countertop and nestled on the shelves weren't for sale, and the store clerk was merely a mannequin.\nIt was all a bit of make-believe, designed to spur visions and feelings of Christmases past. That's what the National Christmas Center is all about.\nBut the festive attraction, a Christmas-themed museum along Lincoln Highway East in eastern Lancaster County for nearly two decades, may soon become a memory itself. After 19 years of operation, its owners have announced plans to close the center following this holiday season.\nSaying the attraction has never been overly profitable, Heidi Brennan, museum and marketing director, said the center's two managing partners - one of whom is her father, Dave Murtagh - are simply getting too old to continue handling the 30,000 visitors who stop by each year.\nShe said they're holding out hope that someone will come along and purchase the center and its exhibits, allowing it to stay up and running. But as of now, the plan is to shut its doors Jan. 7.\nGrowing up in south New Jersey in the 1940s and '50s, Jim Morrison's focus each fall was on one particular day - the day after Thanksgiving. Back then, it wasn't the Black Friday shopping frenzy that it is today. But it was important to Morrison nonetheless.\nHis family would make the trek into Philadelphia to gaze upon the elaborate Christmas displays that had sprouted up overnight at the city's department stores. And if they were lucky, they even got a chance to see Santa making his first appearance of the season.\n\"That's when Christmas started,\" Morrison said. \"It was a day you looked forward to. I loved Christmas.\"\nThat passion, so common in children but often fading in adults, never waned for Morrison.\nSitting on a stool at the entrance to the National Christmas Center's maze of holiday displays, his scraggy gray beard situated between a bright red coat and a black top hat, Morrison said he's been obsessed with the holiday his entire life. He's been creating a Christmas collection since as long as he can remember.\n\"There are things on display here I bought when I was 7 years old,\" he said.\nAs a child, Morrison recalls January days spent searching discarded Christmas trees for bits of tinsel, a forgotten ornament or perhaps even a strand of lights - any bit or piece of the holiday he could hang on to.\nBut as Morrison grew up, he saw things changing. He began to see his beloved holiday morphing into something he didn't recognize. The downtown department stores were vanishing, and the season became more about gifts than about the Christmas experience he cherished.\n\"Malls just didn't do it for me,\" he said.\nSo, Morrison decided to do something about, to rekindle that lost allure. For almost five decades he tried, with attempts at creating a Christmas center failing twice in New York and once in Pennsylvania.\nThen, finally, 19 years ago, he succeeded in bringing his vision to life in a building just east of the tourist haven of Lincoln Highway East, a stone's throw from Rockvale Square Outlets, Miller's Smorgasbord, Dutch Wonderland, The American Music Theater, The Amish Village and a host of other attractions.\nMorrison said the National Christmas Center never has had any money, featuring mostly his own collection of Christmas memorabilia and items donated by friends. When he became partners with Murtagh, the collection was merged with items from a Christmas museum that Murtagh ran.\nThe center slowly expanded, adding piece after piece until the displays grew to fit the building.\n\"All of a sudden, it filled all the rooms,\" Morrison said.\nThe center now features 15 galleries spread across 20,000 square feet. There's a room with a two-tiered toy train display, Santa's workshop with animatronic elves and dancing toy soldier bears, a Dickensian village, ornaments and Christmas trees and twinkling strings of lights covering every nook and cranny.\nThere's even a meandering path through ancient Bethlehem, leading to an impressive, nearly life-sized Nativity scene.\n\"It's beyond what I could have imagined,\" Morrison said of what the center has become. \"People come for the first time, and you can just see the little children still inside of them. I catch people in tears here, they're tears of memory.\n\"There's no other time like Christmas, and it's Christmas every day here. What better place can you be? I wish I could see it for the first time again.\"\nIn Brennan's mind, Morrison and her father run \"one of Lancaster County's hidden treasures.\"\nPeople come from across the United States to visit, from Maine, Texas and Florida. Even national borders don't deter Christmas fans, Brennan said, with the center drawing guests from as far as Australia.\n\"Canadians love us,\" she said with a smile. \"I don't know why, but they love us. We get people from all over the world.\"\nPerhaps, Brennan ponders, it's because the center allows people to forget about Christmas commercialism; instead they relive cherished memories while making some new ones.\nThat's the case for her, she said, which makes the idea of losing the center so jarring.\n\"It's sad, extremely sad,\" Brennan said. \"It's kind of like part of your life, part of your childhood is going away.\"\nMorrison, relying on the magic of Christmas, is hoping a miracle is still in store. He said he wants nothing more than for someone to purchase the center and keep it running.\n\"I've got faith,\" he said. \"This was built through prayer. I'm still praying.\n\"The sad thing is, it's making so many people happy.\"\nThe center is still drawing visitors. On a recent weekday morning the large lot in front of the building held at least two dozen cars and a tour bus, with a second bus arriving shortly before lunch.\nThe wide-eyed guests wandering through the self-guided tour all spoke of their amazement at what they were seeing and their despair over the possibility of it all going away.\n\"We're devastated,\" Bossert said, lamenting the fact that she only just heard about the center.\nShe vowed to come back, and before she was halfway through the displays, she had already called her husband and planned for a trip back two days later.\n\"This is all older people like us have to hold on to,\" she said. \"I have tears in my eyes. This is bringing me back to my childhood.\"\nGina Abel discovered the center a year ago, visiting on a field trip with one of her children. After hearing it was set to close, she packed up four of her kids - her 15-year-old had a school presentation and couldn't come - and made the two-hour drive from Westminster, Md., to see it again.\n\"We find it to be both magical and reverent,\" she said, adding that it has the joy of Santa and the importance of the Christmas story. \"It's very welcoming to people of all ages.\"\nLike Morrison, she said she is hoping for the best.\n\"Christmas is the time for miracles,\" she said.", "University 6, Ferris 1: Tammaya Campbell struck out eight in a complete game and the Titans (3-1) topped the visiting Saxons (2-2) on Monday.

Its more of a Boundary Value Problem, with things like GHGs being the \"boundary\"s.

The mistake that was coming was obvious to anyone with a science background.\nIt is fully okay to scientifically illiterate; there are also many topics I am not knowledgeable about.\nWhat is already a little weird is that such people start making public claims about scientific topics; I would personally prefer to keep such discussions private.\nWhat is beyond comprehension is that such people are so sure of their nonsensical ideas that they aggressively attack scientists and often claim those scientists to be conspiring against humanity.\nAt least I lack the vocabulary to describe this.\n\"@Sanders You are either a mental case or a troll.\"\nOr, most likely, a poe. Think outside the box, TGL.\nI thought a \"poe\" was a type of troll.\nNot necessarily. By definition, a poe is indistinguishable from a fundamentalist posting in earnest. It is often a regular poster just being extremely sarcastic/cynical.\nKevin is serious in what he says, as foolish as his comments may be. He has long displayed his conspiracy theories, paranoia, and racism, at Greg Laden's blog (others as well). The comment here is rather tame for him.\nTowards the topic of this post: I thought one of the assertions of the denialists was that climate scientists were all in cahoots. How do they reconcile that with the 'discovery' mentioned here?\n\"I already felt like banging my head against the wall when I read the title. The mistake that was coming was obvious to anyone with a science background.\"\nOr, in the theory and practice of implementing compilers used by people doing, among other things, scientific computing, which is how I spent my life in the 1970s and 1980s. \"Oh, rounding differences?\" Um, yep!\nI'm going to go scan the paper, it's probably useful in that measuring differences in results that come up on different platforms, optimization levels, etc can help one understand how defensively the code has been written in order to minimize rounding problems.\nHmm, comment in moderation, probably because I said \"scared s*******\", I bet.\nOnly the abstract is available free, too bad.\nConsidering that the effects of rounding on computer weather models was important to the development of chaos theory (back in 1961 or so...), how is the initial paper even surprising?\nSince the \"butterfly effect\" is negligible in real world climate because it is drowned out by macroscopic scalars (sorry, Lorentz), it follows that it should also be negligible in computer climate models. If not, it's a very basic error in the models -- add it to the pile.\nForgive me for not keeping up on the maths, bur rather than trying to value the predictability of the climate model, wouldn't a Monte-Carlo simulation of the climate hindcast be more valuable for bounding it?\nFor example, take the model that was developed in 2000 which most likely had a fit with error in a Monte-Carlo and compar it to the same model in 2005 running hindcast.and 2010 hindcast.\nTrying to map the model to fit observation is a good first guess but there's no guarantee that the observation is \"typical\". This is a well known phenomena in engineering and you don't chase the observation, rather you evaluate the observation and the probability that it is within the estimated normal variance of expectation. Six sigma concepts are based on this and rules of thumb is that a single observation > 3 sigma, or 2 out 3 greater than 2 sigma or 7 out of 8 greater than 1 sigma -would mean that the estimate of normal variance is incorrect. so taking this to a climate model, running many monte-carlo simulations should give a variance and a mean. If observations fall outside rule (3 sigma, 2 sigma, 1 sigma above), either the mean is wrong (if they are all on the same side) or the variance/sensitivity of the model is wrong. the boundary is the monte carlo simulations with various ICs and inputs. I wouldn't particularly care about any single run in the monte carlo, but thousands of runs should yield mean, std dev for the model. Errors can be made assuming the measured previous values are \"typical\" but in reality, the real climate should have about the same variance as the model and the comparison would be to the orthogonal components (i.e. the std dev allowed is a sum of squares boundary of both the model and observation). Is this not a correct interpretation?\nIts quite an interesting topic, but a brief look at the link (above) to PS has left me none the wiser. Perhaps another link?\nConsider the juxtaposition of his last sentence with the paragraph which precedes it. I admit that I have not read the earlier articles in the series but I should have thought the issue of sensitivity to slight changes in something or other must be treated at a mathematical or numerical level* not at the level of comparing the output with observations? Is that wrong?\n*. That means comparing models with models which is an activity which PS has just condemned.\nGarbage story about garbage science. How stupid can you be?!\n@tim B, There's a very large literature on ensemble forecasting, which is essentially what you're describing. (More in NWP than in climate.) The way you've expressed it suggests you don't quite understand how these models work but you're basically on target.\nBoth sides have their conspiracy theorists.\nThere are some skeptics who believe there is some sort of vast conspiracy among climate scientists and certain government officials (I don't). There are those on your side who believe in a vast conspiracy by oil companies to promote skepticism of global warming.\nOf course, in a strict mathematical sense Pielke is right. A time dependent problem is an initial value problem. Climate has time varying \"boundary values\" or forcings which are not mathematically \"boundary values\" at all but \"source terms.' So this whole language is neither rigorous nor correct.\nOf course Lorentz showed that for nonlinear systems, the initial value problem is ill-posed.\nSo by invoking the boundary value problem name, incorrectly, one implies something about climate and weather simulations that is not true, or at least cannot be shown in any conclusive sense.\nThe most charitable interpretation of the boundary value \"analogy\" is that in the limit, the attractor is so strong that everything gets sucked in and all those shorter term variations don't matter. Except, the attractor can be very complex and which part you get sucked into could depend on where you started, etc. The problem here is this is really just \"communication\" and not really mathematics, science, or anything rigorously defensible.\nIf you take an atmosphere-only climate model, and try to simulate its climate, then you end up with a statistically stable simulation, that nonetheless has \"chaotic\" weather. But the climate of the model isn't chaotic.\nI never said climate simulation was impossible, merely that the arguments for its being stable are neither rigorous or scientific.\nHave you ever heard of bifurcations in a nonlinear system?\nThere is no basis for asserting that climate is not chaotic.\nYou see, the problem here is that if climate models are indeed very stable, that is probably due to unphysical numerical dissipation, present in all Navier-Stokes simulations. It well known that this dissipation can strongly damp the dynamics and make things seem stable when they are not. I assume your background is not strong in these subjects, but the effect of dissipation really is mathematically provable.\n[Nah, I did Navier Stokes for my thesis and then more whilst starting up in climate modelling.\nTH: A lot of these metrics that we develop come from computer models. How should people treat the kind of info that comes from computer climate models?\nHansen: I think you would have to treat it with a great deal of skepticism. Because if computer models were in fact the principal basis for our concern, then you have to admit that there are still substantial uncertainties as to whether we have all the physics in there, and how accurate we have it. But, in fact, that's not the principal basis for our concern. It's the Earth's history-how the Earth responded in the past to changes in boundary conditions, such as atmospheric composition. Climate models are helpful in interpreting that data, but they're not the primary source of our understanding.\nTH: Do you think that gets misinterpreted in the media?\nHansen: Oh, yeah, that's intentional. The contrarians, the deniers who prefer to continue business as usual, easily recognize that the computer models are our weak point. So they jump all over them and they try to make the people, the public, believe that that's the source of our knowledge. But, in fact, it's supplementary. It's not the basic source of knowledge. We know, for example, from looking at the Earth's history, that the last time the planet was two degrees Celsius warmer, sea level was 25 meters higher.\nAnd we have a lot of different examples in the Earth's history of how climate has changed as the atmospheric composition has changed. So it's misleading to claim that the climate models are the primary basis of understanding.\nWell then BBD, aside from the name calling, I'm glad to see Hansen owning up to the criticisms of his climate modeling proposals from a long time ago. Apparently, the reviewers of his proposals said the same thing. However, if this is so then why are we spending so much on modeling and running models?\n1. We should be investing in the \"stronger points\" that will give better information.\n2. Why does the IPCC consider the computer models to be one of its lines of evidence for sensitivity and its only line of evidence for projected future temperature rises?\nSorry, there is a \"feature\" of the software for this blog that if you expand the comment box too far, you can no longer edit it.\n...As I was saying. If Hansen is right and I know he is (and really agrees with the reviewers of his proposals who were critical of them), what's with the billions of bytes and words over the years defending climate models and the billions of dollars spent on them?\nThis fact itself makes one distrust this field of science. Which version of Hansen is right? They cannot both be.\nSo, David Young, it sounds like your proposal would be to stop attempting to understand the problem.\n\"David Young\", you are a fake sceptic. Do not play the whining victim when you are correctly categorised. And here, you are doing *exactly* what Hansen describes.\nClimate models are helpful in interpreting that data, but they\u2019re not the primary source of our understanding.\nAlso re-read Rob Honeycutt # 24.\nDavid... I think you'll find that every climate modeler out there holds the same position as Hansen does in the comments presented here. Does that mean climate modeling is pointless and a waste of money? Far from it.\nI would put forth that weather modeling is even worse than climate modeling. Why do we rely so much on weather models today when the predictive powers of any given model is anything short of abysmal? Because collectively, over a range of models and over multiple model runs, they give us a great deal of information.\nDo you remember how weather models predicted the abrupt dogleg to the west hurricane Sandy would take, straight into the NY area, nearly a week in advance?\ntgl, the bit about oil companies is not fictional. The items you promote, however, are far from reality.\nRob, What I propose is stated above. Shouldn't we spend money on the lines of evidence that can give us the clearest answer? Seems like GCM's are admitted to be the weakest by Hansen. In fact, I've had trouble in the last year finding anyone who disagrees, except the uninformed or mathematically naive.\nWeather models are useful, given their limitations. Climate models are mostly weather models just run on very course spatial grids and for a long period of time. So, once the weather model diverges from reality, what evidence is there that the \"statistics\" will be meaningful.\n\"The skeptics ... easily recognize that the computer models are our weak point.\" I believe Hansen now says that paleoclimate is the evidence we should trust. If so, then we should be working hard to reduce uncertainties there. Annan and Hargreaves seem to be doing some new and interesting work in this area, which is also showing lower temperature differences, but you can read about that on James' Empty Blog.\nTGL, have you ever read or heard of the 1998 API strategy document.\nAverage citizens \"understand\" (recognize) uncertainties in climate science; recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the \"conventional wisdom\"\nMedia coverage reflects balance on climate science and recognition of the validity of viewpoints that challenge the current \"conventional wisdom\"\nThe action of plotting or conspiring.\nIan beat me to the punch, but it is not a conspiracy theory when you have ironclad proof of the conspiracy.\nMany palaeoclimate studies have quantified pre-anthropogenic climate change to calculate climate sensitivity (equilibrium temperature change in response to radiative forcing change), but a lack of consistent methodologies produces a wide range of estimates and hinders comparability of results. Here we present a stricter approach, to improve intercomparison of palaeoclimate sensitivity estimates in a manner compatible with equilibrium projections for future climate change. Over the past 65 million years, this reveals a climate sensitivity (in K\u2009W\u22121\u2009m2) of 0.3\u20131.9 or 0.6\u20131.3 at 95% or 68% probability, respectively. The latter implies a warming of 2.2\u20134.8\u2009K per doubling of atmospheric CO2, which agrees with IPCC estimates.\nI believe Hansen now says that paleoclimate is the evidence we should trust.\nWhen did he *not* argue this?\nI think you are engaging in dishonest framing here.\n@Ian The Protocols of the Elders of the American Petroleum Institute?\nI'm half-joking of course, but environmentalists do not exactly have a great track record with \"leaked\" documents. After all, just recently Peter Gleick almost certainly forged a similar document.\nAssuming your document is true (a big assumption), it is weak sauce. I would fully expect everyone on both sides to advocate for their position - that is not a conspiracy.\nWhat is missing from the \"big oil is funding denialism\" theory is the money or the signs of money being spent in large amounts. There isn't some great media campaign by oil companies. There are a few blogs and a few journalists - that's about it.\nIf they were funding a campaign then I'd see constant commercials and advertisements on the subject. I DO see advertisements about various \"renewables\" and \"low carbon\" technologies from oil companies - they are constantly on TV with both implicit and explicit endorsements of global warming orthodoxy.\nYou think an obscure 15-year old document of indeterminate origin and authenticity is \"ironclad proof of a conspiracy?\"\nThe funding of contrarian messaging by the fossil fuel industry is well documented and not in dispute. So why dispute it? It's not worth the effort.\nWe already have 'weather chaos'. Why should the possibility of 'climate chaos' as well, e.g. at high values of the forcing, be an argument for ramping up the forcing?\nDoes the lack of determinism in seismological models of earthquakes mean that builders need not bother about earthquake protection?\nYep. Last time that was relevant for the climate was in the Precambrium during the Snowball Earth episodes. And it may be again in the future, if we trip one of those tipping points, wherever they may be.\nPrecisely the opposite is true. When external forcings are stable, so is the climate, as was the case last during the Holocene --- up to the time when we started messing with things. Globally, locally, for any climatic parameter you care to mention. Just point me to any place on Earth, any time, where the same external forcing situation was associated with two or more different climatic situations.\nYou're out of your depth with climate, in an unusually embarrassing way. As WMC insists on politeness, I'll stop here.\nOf course, it's a pittance as far as ExxonMobil is concerned.\n\"Rob, What I propose is stated above. Shouldn\u2019t we spend money on the lines of evidence that can give us the clearest answer? Seems like GCM\u2019s are admitted to be the weakest by Hansen.\"\nWeakest for what? Hansen (and the mainstream climate science world) points to a long list of evidence ranging from basic physics to paleoclimate to demonstrate that adding CO2 to the atmosphere is going to cause warming, and that it's going to be in excess of the 1C or so per doubling of CO2 caused directly by the radiative properties of CO2 (due to feedbacks, in particular the large water vapor feedback).\nGCMs aren't needed for this. They're the \"weakest\" evidence not necessarily because they're particularly weak as models go, but because the mountains of other evidence are so strong.\n\"Weather models are useful, given their limitations. Climate models are mostly weather models just run on very course spatial grids and for a long period of time. So, once the weather model diverges from reality, what evidence is there that the \u201cstatistics\u201d will be meaningful.\"\nYou overstate your case. Weather models have a notoriously difficult time predicting the weather in the US's pacific northwest during winter. But they get the big picture right - low after low forming, front after front moving onshore and giving us our notorious rain. What they get wrong are details - will the next low form in one, two or three days and will zero, one or two dry days separate two fronts moving in succession towards Portland? When the current high with its 20 degree clear skies, when hit by the next pacific front, cool the front to below freezing giving us snow, lead to an inversion giving us freezing rain, or just lead to grey cold rain? Getting details of this kind of thing right further out than a few hours is really difficult.\nHowever, the weather models never diverge from reality to the point of, say, predicting 105F weather in Portland in January ... they're still bounded by the climate reality of the region.\nMartin, With respect, I don't think you understood what I said. There is no evidence that climate is a unique function of forcings, there are a lot of them and each has a different effect. And there are tipping points too, some of them result in small changes.\n1. The topic of rapid climate change is a topic of a lot of research and a lot of people are interested in it. There is a growing literature.\n2. These things are common in the Navier-Stokes equations even with constant forcing. Swinney from Univ. of Texas did some really good work on the Taylor column about 25 years which is experimental. Careful numerical experiments confirm his work.\n3. In short after a bifurcation point there can be many solutions that are stable. Accidental details can determine which one you get, including unmeasurable noise.\n4. With climate, there are so many factors, its unlikely that anyone can point you to 2 different times in history when the \"same\" forcings resulted in different climates. There are never 2 situations where the forcing is the same. In the mean, time simple systems that are subsystems of the climate system can tell us something. In science and engineering, those are the best analyses.\nI already sent you some material from the published literature on these topics. Do you believe there are things we are not considering or missed? I mentioned some recent work on James' blog. I think the evidence is pretty persuasive and consistent with experiments.\nYou know, I would really like to see evidence and clear arguments on this.\nDhog, Gerry Browning says that weather models have to be reinitialized with high altitude winds frequently to be stable. Any system can be stabilized by adding dissipation. A course computational grid introduces a lot of dissipation.\nThe problem here I suspect is that the real viscosity is quite small compared to the planetary scale. Thus for practical, you have the Euler equations, which are notorously unstable when discretized.\nThe weather in the Pacific Northwest is rather stable during the summer time. But there are wide swings in winter. Heavy snow and cold spells sometimes but infrequently occur. One thing I have noticed is that weather forecasters are shrewd and often say \"the models diverge after a couple days and I slanted the forcast toward climatology. Such a forecast is not of much value, but its the best that can be done.\nThere is no evidence that climate is a unique function of forcings, there are a lot of them and each has a different effect. And there are tipping points too, some of them result in small changes.\nSee Rohling et al. (2013).\nOr let's just take the LGM and Holocene. About 4.5C GAT change between two quasi-equilibrium climate states sustained by ~6W/m^2 change in forcing.\nBack of envelope gives you 0.75C per W/m^2 change in forcing.\nThe real issue with the models is just how wrong they are vs actual observations. Every single one projects higher temperatures than are currently being recorded. Why is that?\nDavid said, \"Rob, What I propose is stated above. Shouldn\u2019t we spend money on the lines of evidence that can give us the clearest answer?\"\nYou seem to deliberately avoid my point. How else do you propose that we come up with projections for future climate without models? The reality of what you're proposing would be to just wait until we drive off the cliff to test to see if there is a cliff or not.\nClimate models are clearly not worthless. They give us a better picture of future scenarios better than having no information at all. Given fundamental radiative physics and paleo data we know we have a potentially critical issue on our hands. That is why we spend what we do on climate models.\nAh \"the debate is over\" - where have I heard that one before?\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists? That's the impeccable source we are talking about here?\nExxon gives tens of millions to higher education every single year in the US. The UCS has a lot of misrepresentations in there - like taking small chunks of that money, combining the sums over many years, and then declaring \"millions\" spent to promote skepticism.\nThey also do the whole \"employees of this company gave money to...\" which is also flagrantly dishonest when you have a company as big as Exxon.\nI mean, you do know that \"Big Oil\" funds plenty of scientists on your side right? Or do you think that none of the millions Exxon sends to Pennsylvania every year make it to Michael Mann?\nI guess their funding is only a big deal when it gets sent to skeptics right?\nRob, It seems to me that observationally constrained estimates of sensitivity will give a better constraint on the future than GCM's. Of course, we as a species are notorously poor at predicting the future.\n@TGL ... The Heartland Institute, The Global Warming Policy Foundation, CATO, Heritage, AEI, ALEC, etc are funded by right-wing ideologues. They do not single out climate science, they're generally equal opportunity anti-science types. This isn't really a point of contention, is it? Now, considering that they spend tens/hundreds of millions more supporting politicians to give their captive scientists a gloss of respectability shouldn't we include that money as well? How else, for example, does a Wegman get his views into the Congressional Record and gist for the 'See, there's scientific doubt..\" crowd? If you can't see the funding connection, then you choose not to see. And why do you think conservatives in the US fight so hard to keep these funders legally secret?\nMaybe TheGoodLocust could give us a list of all the published research that has been the result of Exxon's funding for all these \"scpetics\"?\nOr can he only find a long list of press releases and other propaganda?\nBecause that is the first obvious difference between funding for science and funding for \"sceptics\": the first results in an increase to the sum total of human knowledge, while the latter is aimed at detracting from it, as admitted in the leaked Heartland documents which revealed that Heartland knows it is lying and aims to spread more lies through the deliberate targeting of education.\nAll that said, it is a misfeature of the way we compute that very few large computations are bitwise repeatable across platforms. There is nothing particular to climate in this problem, nor is chaos relevant. It's just that we give too much power to the compiler-writers.\nThere are good scientific reasons for bit-for-bit reproducibility, and it should not be foreclosed by the high performance platform manufacturers that we have it at least as an option. All published results should be bit-for-bit reproducible and all tools required for such reproduction should be published to a repository at the time of publication of the results. Computation is a perfect tool for reproducibility, and the fact that the manufacturers make us throw it away is due to their idiotic obsessive performance benchmarking at the expense of actual scientific productivity.\nAgain, this has nothing whatsoever to do with climate or with chaos. It's a flaw in high performance computing.\n\"The weather in the Pacific Northwest is rather stable during the summer time. But there are wide swings in winter. Heavy snow and cold spells sometimes but infrequently occur. One thing I have noticed is that weather forecasters are shrewd and often say \u201cthe models diverge after a couple days and I slanted the forcast toward climatology.

If customers don't want performance, compiler-writers will oblige as long as they're paid for it (optimization is hard, after all).\nStill, pretty much any optimizing compiler system you want to mention provides compile-time switches to turn off those optimizations that cause the most problems. The paper in question points to this in that they talk about models compiled with \"-O3\", etc, i.e. aggressive optimization documented as very likely to increase rounding error problems, order-of-execution artifacts, etc.\nOf course, pinning the blame on compiler-writers presumes that the authors of code sensitive to such optimization are writing their code in a way that minimizes such problems in the first place, i.e. that if their code isn't re-ordered etc the problem wouldn't occur. This simply isn't true. The subset of scientific programmers smart enough to carefully craft their floating-point expressions to minimize such issues are exactly the subset that will turn off re-ordering and similar optimizations in the first place, therefore - no problem.\nSomething not addressed by the paper, apparently, are questions like \"what level of optimization is actually asked of compilers when compiling model code such as GISS Model-E?\"\nThe paper assumes (AFACT, it's paywalled) that high level optimization is the norm.\nDo we know this is true?\nSo, Tobis, let's play a game ... why don't you provide us some examples of good/bad code that, unoptimized, faithfully followed by a compiler, minimizes/maximizes rounding errors?\ngive me one example of a small difference in external forcing producing a large, persistent difference in climate, for a climate close to late Holocene. Reality or (realistic) model.\nHowever, the weather models never diverge from reality to the point of, say, predicting 105F weather in Portland in January \u2026 they\u2019re still bounded by the climate reality of the region.\nMT, I don't necessarily agree that it is the fault of the compiler-writers or hardware manufacturers. I suspect that users (including, but certainly not limited to climate scientists) will vote with their wallets for speed over reproducibility.\nIncidentally, the UK Met Office (/ Hadley Centre?) do invest a lot of time and effort into bitwise reproducibility. I wouldn't like to speculate as to whether this is money well spent or not.\n\"There\u2019s an important distinction to make here, which is that climate modelling isn\u2019t an Initial Value Problem, as weather prediction is. Its more of a Boundary Value Problem, with things like GHGs being the \u201cboundary\u201ds. \"\n....is worth extending slightly since this gets to the heart of the Hong et al paper and its observations and conclusions.\nClimate simulations like all computational simulations that assess time-dependent trajectories are both Initial Value problems (IVP) and Boundary Value Problems (BVP). The IVP relates to the particular trajectories of individual runs. The (more important) BVP relates to the ensemble of trajectories that defines the likely range of behaviour within a set of parameterizations. Much as the climate in the real world is bounded (by total thermal energy in the system, forcings and so on) so the simulations are bounded by its parameterizations.\nWhat Hong et al showed is that the results of single runs with identical parameterization and initialization are platform/software-dependent but the ensemble i(what we're interested in a climate simulation) is broadly independent of the platform/software [*].\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the both ensemble results produce a tropical rainfall pattern comparable to the observation, with the main rain-belt along the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) (cf. Figs. 3a,b,and c). It confirms the resemblance that three-month averaged daily precipitations simulated from the 10-member initial condition ensemble runs are within a narrow range between 3.387 mm d\u22121 and 3.395 mm d\u22121.Those from the 10- member software system ensemble runs are within a similar range between 3.388 mm d\u22121 and 3.397 mm d\u22121.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with oil companies funding research or public information about climate change. It is, after all, a subject which is relevant to their business and in which they have a legitimate interest.\nThe problem comes when such funding is done with the deliberate intention of giving the public a misleading impression of the state of climate science, in order to reduce the likelihood of legislation which might damage their commercial interests.\nThe fact that his has happened is so well documented as to surely be beyond dispute. It doesn't mean though that oil companies haven't also provided funding for research or other climate change related projects which are perfectly legitimate.\nThe fact that his has happened is so well documented as to surely be beyond dispute.\nExactly my point to TGL (my # 35). Predictably ignored by TGL at #47.\nWhy TGL feels it necessary to dispute this and obfuscate the point is puzzling.\ndhog, Have you ever read the National Weather Service forcast discussions? The forecasts themselves of course don't say this. The discussion for Seattle says this rather often.\nMarten, Simple wing at angle of attack. It's called hystereous and has been known for at least 70 years. If you start from attached flow you will stay attached until you reach stall when the lift drops precipitously. If you start post stall, you stay with the low lift answer as alpha decreases until you get reattachment. Recent work shows there may actually be several intermediate separated flow solutions too that are physical. Thus, there are at least 2 different solutions for the same forcing and probably more than 2. You can easily find lots of other ones in the fluid dynamics literature.\nYea, weather models don't \"blow up.\" Browning says that's because of unphysical dissipation and reinitializing the upper winds frequently. I vote for the dissipation. You can find in the code documentation references to hyper viscosity.\nChris, The boundary value problem part is simply not techically correct. Climate is an initial value problem with time varying forcings. A forcing is not a boundary condition. In this case, the forcing is expressed throughout the atmosphere.\nThe idea that the attractor is a function of the forcings is correct. But that's not a very useful observation. The attractor can have very high dimension.\nI'm not sure about this bitwise compatibility issue. If in fact, the problem is sensitive to numerical differences at the 10^-14 level, that is something that is interesting in its own right, viz., the problem is not mathematically stable and you need to investigate that carefully. I would say rounding error differences are inevitable and \"fixing the problem\" merely masks important information and gives a false sense of security.\n\"Climate is an initial value problem...\" isn't really a meaningful statement David Young. \u201cWeather is an initial value problem\u2026.\u201d is more meaningful. Clearly a climate state at equilibrium is bounded by the energy in the climate system as well as other factors like ocean depth, amount and location of land and so on. The bounds constrain possible trajectories of any particular temporal progression within the climate state.\nI think you may be mixing up the climate state (a Boundary Value Problem) with the particular trajectory (an Initial Value Problem) of the system within the climate state that evolves according to internal variability. Computationally this is the difference between individual realizations of a model under a set of parameterizations and the ensemble of model runs that should encompass the variability within the climate state. It's the latter that is of interest in climate modelling. Hong et al. in the paper we're discussing show that the platform/software dependence has little effect on the latter (as we might well expect).\nIt may be that one would wish to assess the effects of forcings (e.g. changes in solar output; volcanic eruptions; massive release of greenhouse gases) but these are external to the climate system and provide new boundary conditions within which the climate system evolves. In a simulation (e.g. a GCM) these would be \u201cadded in\u201d to assess the response of the system being simulated. They\u2019re not part of the internal variability nor are they a consideration with respect to initialization of the model and so are not a consideration with respect to the Initial Value Problem\u2026.\nAnother indicator of trollery - opinionated, serial, repetitive wrongness aside - is ignoring inconvenient comments, eg #31 #32, #43, #44.\n\"David Young\" is not demonstrating good faith.\n\"So, Tobis, let\u2019s play a game \u2026 why don\u2019t you provide us some examples of good/bad code that, unoptimized, faithfully followed by a compiler, minimizes/maximizes rounding errors?\"\nIn practice (a - b) + c != a + (c - b) .\nA useful compiler allowing reproducibility would have repeatability across platforms and across decompositions.\nThe climate models with which I am familiar are repeatable across decompositions (at some optimization level) but not across platforms or compiler versions.\nI am most interested in multi-model ensembles. If you seek to extend an ensemble but the platform changes out from under you, you want to ensure that you are running the same dynamics. It is quite conceivable that you aren't. There's a notorious example of a version of the Intel Fortran compiler that makes a version of CCM produce an ice age, perhaps apocryphal, but the issue is serious enough to worry about.\nIt really matters in a lot of cases that one runs the \"same\" model ensemble. WIth bit-for-bit reproducibility this can be verified. Without it, you have a vast and fruitless problem just verifying that you're in the same problem space.\nI agree that the customers are not demanding cross-platform repeatability. Most of the customers haven't got the remotest clue that this is possible, never mind desireable. But it is both.\nIn practice (a \u2013 b) + c != a + (c \u2013 b) .\"\nExcellent. Now, if you understand that the values you're working with are sensitive to the order of execution you will, of course, turn off compiler optmizations that can lead to the reordering of such equations, right? You understand the problem, you understand that you need to turn off such optimizations.\nAnd, of course, providers of compilers state the same.\n\"The PGI compiler does not provide any optimization level that will guarantee that no floating point operations will be reordered and by default it is not strictly IEEE compliant, occasionally using \"slightly less accurate methods\" to improve performance.\n% ftn -O0 -Kieee MyCode.F90\"\nPortland Group tells you: if you want the most accuracy and IEEE compliance, turn off optimization.\n\"I agree that the customers are not demanding cross-platform repeatability. Most of the customers haven\u2019t got the remotest clue that this is possible, never mind desireable. But it is both.\"\nThe problem was a heck of a lot worse before IEEE floating point specs were adopted. This at least removed a lot of the potential cross-platform issues and, in addition, incorporates well-thought out rounding options that were often ignored in earlier, manufacturer-specific FP implementations (Cray-1, for instance, the supercomputer of choice for large-scale modeling in the late 1970s).\nTGL's whirligig dance at #47 is hilarious.\n(1) Complaining about the messenger (he/she doesn't like UCS).\n(2) Complaining about the fact that the report identifies many smaller donations that add up to something like $16 million. It's not really clear what TGL's problem with \"addition\" is.\n(3) Complaining about the fact that UCS documents both contributions from ExxonMobil itself and its employees.\n(4) Insisting that it's OK for ExxonMobil to subsidize \"climate skeptic\" propaganda because the company may also make donations to universities.\nWhy so defensive, TGL? Unless you're working for ExxonMobil or one of the \"skeptic\" think-tanks they support, wouldn't it be simpler to just say \"Yeah, OK, I guess fossil fuel companies have been funding 'skeptic' groups. The comparison I made back in #18 was inappropriate.\"\nAnd there's nothing particularly surprising about this. As others have noted, the fossil fuel industry is just following the same playbook used by tobacco companies.\n\"On the other hand, most aren\u2019t running applications that require maximum precision and minimum sensitivity to rounding errors\" is true but not remotely the issue.\nA capacity to verify that you are running \"the same model\", for purposes of 1) refactoring or 2) extending an ensemble or just 3) verifying that published results are what they claim to be and not completely made up, all these are comparably important with optimum raw performance.\nThe end user, the application developer and the reviewers should have a hand in setting the tradeoff, not be forced to cede it completely to the compiler writers to do their benchmark contests.\nThis is not to defend Watts et al's confusion and ignorance about sensitivity to initial conditions and what a climate model actually is and what it is good for. But confusion aside, repeatability, like transparency, is a legitimate goal and one we should strive for, not argue against.\n#69; Perhaps a bit technical, but actually I do not understand why repeatability goes away when I allow the compiler to reorder the computations.\nI have the same (highly optimized) calculation with the same initial conditions. I run the SAME exact executable twice with the SAME input files.\nResults disagree and of course due to sensitivity to initial conditions they diverge and are not comparable.\nWhy doesn't the more optimized calculation deliver the same results AS ITSELF every time? I don't really get that.\n\"\u201cOn the other hand, most aren\u2019t running applications that require maximum precision and minimum sensitivity to rounding errors\u201d is true but not remotely the issue.\"\nIt is because it reduces market pressure on hardware designers, application library developers, and compiler writers to minimize problems.\nTo all: note that http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/2013/07/29/repeatability-of-large-computations/ now exists.\n\"I have the same (highly optimized) calculation with the same initial conditions.

Any non-multiprocessing program run on a single processor should be deterministic, optimized or not. If I run into a situation like this, I first suspect uninitalized variables and the like. As a compiler writer you certainly hope you (or support engineers) can find such problems.\nThere is, of course, also the possibility of a bug in the compiler itself. A memory allocation error in an environment where, say, the OS does (say) asynch I/O in user memory space is the kind of situation that could cause to hard-to-reproduce results.\nWhen multiprocessing is involved, even on a single processor system, execution order for separate threads/processes is rarely going to be exactly the same when the program's run multiple times, because the O/S's scheduler is impacted by other programs running on the system, etc. Writers of real-time operating systems go to great pains to be able to guarantee some level of maximum time to respond to events, etc, and are more deterministic in general than general purpose O/S environments like linux but the pitfalls are still many.\n64 CPUs on 6 12-CPU nodes typically, so that explains it. Thanks.\nThe sensitivity of a model to hardware or optimisation changes *can* be indicative of bugs or inappropriate code in the system. The move from NEC SX8 to IBM Power 7 highlighted some inappropriate tests in UM convection code that were triggered far more often on the IBM due to the way small numbers were stored. It wasn't a significant error, but the divergences were big enough to make it hard to validate optimisation changes.\nWhat is the optimal temperature of the planet?\n[The people I talk to are more concerned about rate of chamge than absolute temps.", "PARSIPPANY, N.J., Feb. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- PBF Logistics LP (NYSE: PBFX, the \"Partnership\") announced today that a wholly-owned subsidiary has entered into an agreement to acquire four refined product terminals located in the greater Philadelphia region (the \"East Coast Terminals\") from an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. for a total consideration of $100.0 million. This acquisition expands the Partnership's storage and terminalling footprint and introduces third-party customers to the Partnership's revenue base. The acquisition is expected to be financed through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings from the Partnership's senior secured revolving credit facility and equity, which may include common units sold to our sponsor, PBF Energy. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.\nPBFX Chief Executive Officer Thomas Nimbley said, \"The acquisition of the East Coast Terminals is PBFX's first third-party acquisition, adds meaningful third-party, fee-based revenue and represents an attractive acquisition multiple. The addition of the East Coast Terminals increases the Partnership's total capacity by over 100% to approximately 8.1 million shell barrels and diversifies its customer and asset base. We expect the acquisition to be accretive to distributable cash flow upon closing.\" Mr. Nimbley continued, \"PBF Logistics has been able to execute its strategy and deliver growth to our unitholders. PBF Energy, as a sponsor, is committed to the continued growth and strategic development of PBF Logistics. We are excited about the transaction and look forward to welcoming the East Coast Terminals employees and customers to the PBF Logistics family.\nLocated in the Philadelphia market, the East Coast Terminals are ideally situated in the sixth largest metropolitan area in the United States with significant local demand for refined products. The terminals provide a critical link for the approximately 1.3 million barrels per day of refining capacity located within 100 miles of the terminals and associated downstream demand. With extensive pipeline, truck and deep-water marine connectivity, the East Coast terminals have the flexibility to accommodate a wide variety of potential customer requirements.\nThe East Coast Terminals are expected to allow PBF Logistics to leverage its expanded footprint and capitalize on commercial opportunities with new customers and leverage opportunities with PBF Energy due to the close proximity of PBF Energy's East Coast refining system. In conjunction with the transaction, the Partnership expects to invest approximately $5 million, from cash on hand, to improve infrastructure in order to increase throughput capability at the East Coast Terminals. Based on a total transaction cost of $105 million, including the $5 million investment and synergy opportunities, the Partnership expects the East Coast Terminals to generate approximately $15 million of pro forma EBITDA, of which approximately two-thirds is expected to be from third-party customers.\nThe assets to be acquired include a total of 57 product tanks with a total shell capacity of approximately 4.2 million shell barrels, pipeline connections to the Colonial, Buckeye, Sunoco Logistics and other proprietary pipeline systems, 26 truck loading lanes and marine facilities capable of handling barges and ships.\nThe Partnership's management believes that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash from operations or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. Due to the forward-looking nature of forecasted EBITDA, information to reconcile forecasted EBITDA to forecasted cash flow from operating activities is not available as management is unable to project working capital changes for future periods at this time.\nDisclosures in this press release contain \"forward-looking statements.\" All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that management expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.

And they have been immensely successful since opening in 2010.\nThe Southern Maryland Wine Growers Cooperative initially formed in 2006-07. Many of the organization\u2019s members were looking for another direction after tobacco\u2019s future went south.\nThe resulting cooperative effort has put the winery in a position to \u201ccreate our own market,\u201d he noted.\nTwelve growers in Maryland now provide the grapes.\nWeather is always a concern, he admitted, noting that an overly wet summer or errant hurricane can destroy a season\u2019s work.\nPerhaps not as challenging as when the cooperative first formed, however. Working with St. Mary\u2019s County Government, the Town of Leonardtown and Maryland, the group was able to procure the old State Highway Administration building at the corner of Route 5 and Newtown Neck Road. The only problem was, because of oil and fluids that leaked under the building when it was a state roads equipment garage, soil removal and remediation had to take place at great cost just to make the structure inhabitable. Most of the work was funded through grants and town and county help.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt that the town was already considering making a park there anyway,\u201d Murphy stated.\nAfter occupying and renovating the space, the cooperative has thrived following its 2010 opening and their wines have made headlines ever since.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve won well over 200 awards since we opened,\u201d Murphy said.\nMcIntosh Run, POL\u2019s fruit wine named after the creek that runs past the winery, has just won the top award for fruit wine at the 27th Annual Maryland Governor\u2019s Cup. It was the sixth straight year in a row McIntosh Run has won.\nA lot of the credit goes to winemaker Patrick Isles, Murphy said, a member of the cooperative since its inception who grows Barbera, Chambourcin, Cabernet Franc, Dolcetto, Malvasia Bianca, Marechal Foch, Norton, Petit Sirah, Petit Verdot, Sangiovese, Vidal Blanc and Viognier grapes at Summerseat Farm in Mechanicsville.\nIsles has produced award-winning wines year after year at POL, but Murphy said winemaking is a full-time job.\n\u201cPatrick has decided to step back, because he already has a full-time job,\u201d he added.\nLauren Y. Zimmerman, a Canadian transplant to Southern Maryland who has made wine in New Zealand and worked at Slack in St. Mary's County, has joined the team as winemaker and is already up to her red hair in an abundant grape harvest.\nAt 12 members, the Southern Maryland Wine Growers Cooperative shows no signs of slowing down.\nBeing one of two cooperatives in the U.S. is a plus, Murphy agreed.\n\u201cObviously, the cooperative allowed us to get off the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other wineries in the area have grown, but we use only Maryland grapes and we pride ourselves on that.", "While questions still remain about the Jacksonville Armada's future, one thing is clear, their financially troubled league will play a 2017 season.\nThe North American Soccer League officially received sanctioning as a Division Two soccer league from the United States Soccer Federation for 2017 on Friday evening. The formerly Division Three United Soccer League also received Division Two status.\n\u201cAfter an exhaustive process working with both leagues, in the best interest of the sport the U.S. Soccer Board of Directors has decided to grant provisional Division II status to the NASL and USL,\u201d said U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati in a statement.\nSoccer Division Two is equivalent to baseball's AAA. one step below Major League Soccer.\nSports Illustrated reports that the Armada will be one of eight teams that take the field for the spring season in 2017.

Mr. Powell and Ms. Girard were not present at the hearing, although Mr. Harris said he notified them about it by mail.\nHe said the town has done several inspections of the property since 2015 and the condition of the home and the bulkhead has become worse.\n\u201cThe property will pose a risk to the health and safety of the neighborhood in its current condition,\u201d Mr. Harris said at the hearing.\nHe recommended that the building, its foundation, and any septic system or cesspool be completely removed, and that an exterminator be called before the demolition so that any vermin living in the building don\u2019t escape to neighboring properties.\nHe recommended that the town apply for state Department of Environmental Conservation permits to replace the bulkhead in the rear of the property, on the canal between Long Neck Boulevard and Royal Avenue.\nSupervisor Jay Schneiderman suggested the bulkhead repairs be done only to the minimum amount needed to guarantee public safety.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need the Cadillac version,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do the Hyundai version,\u201d Mr. Harris replied.\nThe total cost of the house demolition and bulkhead repair is estimated at $130,000. Nearly all of that \u2014 $100,000 \u2014 will go toward the latter. Officials said it would cost even more to remove the bulkhead. Mr. Harris plans to put a lien on the property so that the town gets reimbursed for any work it does there. The supervisor said Suffolk County will reimburse the town for any unpaid taxes.\nRon Fisher, president of the Flanders, Riverside and Northampton Community Association, said the home has been in poor condition since 2008.\nWhile one speaker suggested that a neighboring property owner was interested in purchasing the site, town officials said waiting for a sale to close would take time.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re willing to slow down here,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said.", "On the opening day of the fiftieth Venice Biennale last month, the sweltering space outside the U.S. Pavilion was transformed into a typical New York street scene: A swarm of agitated police descended on a Senegalese vendor and his table of faux designer handbags. Any minute they would haul him away. Or would they? As it turned out, the vendor was not a vendor at all, but a tourist enlisted by Fred Wilson, the American representative to the Biennale, whose work was displayed in the pavilion. And the bags weren\u2019t Prada knockoffs but one-of-a-kind pieces Wilson had created from the same handmade fabric he\u2019d used to costume the mannequins that were part of the installation. The visit by police was unplanned, but once again the artist had turned an ordinary tableau into something extraordinary.\nCall it trompe l\u2019oeil curating, a term Wilson coined for what could be described as meta-museology. Since 1992, when he created \u201cMining the Museum,\u201d a watershed exhibition in Baltimore, Wilson has been making people uncomfortable with otherwise familiar objects\u2014or their absence. Consider two pieces from that show that are included in a Wilson retrospective now at the University of Houston and scheduled to open at the Studio Museum in Harlem next April. In one, Wilson placed a Ku Klux Klan hood inside an Edwardian-era baby carriage, transmogrifying it into something horrifying. When it was first shown, Wilson says, the Maryland Historical Society called him to ask what to do with a school group that included some children with parents who were KKK members. \u201cThe image is charged by what you bring to it,\u201d he says.\nAnother, equally powerful piece, Cabinetmaking, 1820\u20131960, juxtaposed a group of ornate nineteenth-century chairs with a crude whipping post used to hold slaves for beating; Wilson discovered all of the objects in the historical society\u2019s archives. \u201c \u2018Mining the Museum\u2019 changed the way I understood what it meant to put objects in a public space,\u201d says Thelma Golden, chief curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem.\nPerhaps the most resonant work in the pavilion is its simplest: Wilson contracted the famed Murano glassmakers to create a traditional seventeenth-century chandelier in ebony-black glass. Hung in the entrance of the neoclassical pavilion, against yellow walls meant to evoke the gold-leaf chambers of St. Mark\u2019s basilica, the chandelier could be a giant spider, or a black cloud of tears. \u201cIt definitely has a funereal feeling,\u201d Wilson says.\nBorn in the Bronx in 1954 to a Caribbean mother and an African-American father, Fred Wilson quickly got used to adapting to new environments. The family moved every five years, each time to a home designed by his mother, an art and music teacher. His father, now retired, was a civil engineer who supervised, among other projects, the building of the lower level of the George Washington Bridge.\nWilson and his mother and sister returned to the Bronx after he finished grade school. He attended the LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan. He got his first glimpse of the museum world when he took art classes at the Metropolitan Museum, wandering after-hours into areas that the public never saw. At SUNY Purchase, from which he graduated in 1976, he studied performance art and dance and worked at the campus\u2019s Neuberger Museum as a guard.\nIn 1987, he got a chance to put his insider\u2019s knowledge to work when he became the director of the Longwood Arts Project, an alternative space in the South Bronx. One show, \u201cRooms With a View,\u201d played with the notion of the installation space itself by placing a trio of emerging artists in three different settings: a contemporary gallery, a turn-of-the-century space, and a small ethnographic museum\u2014where the artists\u2019 work was identified not with their names but with generic history-oriented museum-style labels (e.g., FOUND, WILLIAMSBURG SECTION, BROOKLYN, LATE 20TH CENTURY). The deceptively simple juxtaposition of art objects, display space, and institutional labels became a template for much of Wilson\u2019s later work. \u201cI sort of go outside the museum and tell people what the museum is trying to tell them,\u201d he says. In recognition of his unique vision, the MacArthur Foundation awarded him a \u201cgenius\u201d grant in 1999.\nOn a sizzling day in early July, Wilson opens the door to the rambling East Village loft he shares with his partner of 22 years, artist Whitfield Lovell. Wilson\u2019s curatorial curiosity is in evidence everywhere\u2014from the ceramic pots and globes he collects, to the neatly arranged bars of novelty soaps in the bathroom ironically labeled white men, to the taxidermic display of birds. The two men share a powerful acquisition habit: Lovell collects tintypes, Cuban art, Mexican retablos, and all sorts of hands. \u201cIt reflects the interior of both of our minds,\u201d says Wilson of the loft.\nBut changes are afoot. Wilson has just converted a small building in Williamsburg into a studio that, he says, is \u201cthe exact opposite of this space.\u201d Triumphantly, he leads a small posse\u2014his assistant, Gloria, and me\u2014into Brooklyn to check it out. It is pristine, the equivalent of a blank white page. With its garage-style glass-paned door, it looks like a minimalist gallery. But it won\u2019t take Wilson long to turn it into an elaborate alternate reality. \u201cMy studio is in my head,\u201d he says. Art is in the cleverly culled details.", "While making purchases allegedly with cloned credit cards, the duo was busted by loss prevention at the Wal-Mart on Cattleman Road and interstate 75.\n\"They had 110 credit cards with their names on the front of them but every magnetic strip on the back of all 110 cards was someone else's identification number,\" said Wendy Rose, community affairs manager for the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office.\nLast August, the agency arrested a couple from New York who they say also tried to make purchases at the same Walmart store.\nDuring a raid on their hotel room, detectives found a thumb drive, computer and scanner used to clone the credit card with stolen bank information.\nThe arrests are an example of how the credit card information hacked from retail stores and skimmers at gas stations end up in the hands of criminals.\nWhile police have been successful in catching those using the cards, they have not had the same success in locating the source of the stolen numbers and those in custody don't cooperate in giving that information.\n\"They may have got these cards from someone, but they don't know where they got the cards or got the information,\" said Detective Jason Friday.\nA Lexis Nexis study reports that credit card fraud cost business $190 dollars a year, while customers suffer a loss of $4.8 million.\nAnother study by The Economist reports that credit card fraud in the U.S. is consistently on the rise, ahead of any other country.\nWith no signs that this type of fraud will end soon, it will be up to consumers to protect their vital credit card information by being vigilant.\n\"Being very caution about where you use your credit or debit card, paying close attention to your bank account and considering using cash,\" Rose said.", "On \u2018Giving Tuesday,\u2019 you can be a hero, too.\nOn Giving Tuesday, you can help the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund help injured military personnel.\nTraumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are the signature wounds of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

During that time, \u201cnothing was getting better,\u201d said Milo.\nEventually he was transferred to the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE), a 72,000 square foot, state-of-the-art facility in Bethesda, Maryland, designed to diagnose and treat military personnel and veterans with TBI and psychological health conditions. It\u2019s the only facility of its kind.\nThere he received four weeks of intensive treatment and was diagnosed with TBI and post-traumatic stress \u2014 along with a host of other conditions.\n\u201cWhen I went into NICoE I had 2 diagnoses; when I left I had 27, and that was not a bad thing,\u201d said Milo. They included fractured discs in his back, hearing loss, eye problems (\u201cwhen you get your head rattled around, sometimes your eyes don\u2019t want to work,\u201d noted Milo) and central auditory processing disorder.\nThe diagnoses were a turning point. \u201cOnce you can specify a diagnosis, you can specify how to treat it,\u201d said Milo.\nTo bring treatment for TBIs and psychological health issues to more service members and veterans, the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund (IFHF), the non-for-profit behind NICoE, has begun opening satellite centers, known as Intrepid Spirit Centers, at military bases around the country.\nEach center spans some 25,000 square feet and costs approximately $11 million to build and equip. While much of the operation at NICoE involves research into TBI and psychological health conditions, Intrepid Spirit Centers focus solely on diagnosis and treatment.

While the Cougars were top-heavy with the Pac-10\u2019s leading scorer in Klay Thompson (22.6 points per game) and key backup Faizel Aden (16.3 ppg), Washington\u2019s scoring distribution trickles down to the far end of the bench.\nThe Huskies sport one of the conference\u2019s most electric scoring guards in Isaiah Thomas (15.3 ppg), and get consistent production from forwards Matthew Bryan-Amaning (14.2 ppg) and former Campbell Hall standout Justin Holiday (12.5 ppg), but 10 players average more than five points through 12 games.\nUCLA predictably let Thompson and Aden get theirs on Wednesday \u2013 Thompson leading all scorers with 26 points and Aden adding 19 \u2013 but the Bruins limited all other Cougars. Forward DeAngelo Casto had eight points, forward Brock Motum five, and point guard Reggie Moore had just five points after scoring 24 last season at Pauley Pavilion.\nTalk about highs and lows \u2013 UCLA\u2019s two 2009-10 matchups with Washington ran the team through the gauntlet of emotions.\nThe Bruins\u2019 home matchup with the Huskies on Jan. 21 ended with a thrill, a buzzer-beating jump shot at the top of the key by former guard Mustafa Abdul-Hamid that gave UCLA a 62-61 win.\nMore than a month later, the Huskies turned their final home game of the season into a Quincy Pondexter celebration, as he was showered with constant adulation while scoring 20 points in a 97-68 win.\nThe loss was Howland\u2019s worst as head coach at UCLA.\nHowland was incredulous that the 9-3 Huskies, the preseason pick to win the Pac-10 by the media and the only conference team to be in the top 25 this season, were not still ranked.\nWashington, coming off a 73-67 overtime win at USC on Wednesday, has three losses to now-ranked teams.", "It started with a trainload of cattle.\nIn the summer of 1877, the United States endured an outbreak of labor unrest so widespread and violent that some thought a new American revolution was in the offing, this time tinged with the communist ideals that had just burned through France.\nThe Great Railroad Strike of 1877 began in Martinsburg, W.Va., on July 16 when railroad workers responded to yet another pay cut by shutting down the yard. Violent clashes broke out, and from there the trouble raced along the great railroad lines into Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Chicago and St. Louis, building in ferocity as it went.\nNearly two square miles of Pittsburgh went up in flames. Mobs of police and mobs of rioters hunted each other down in Chicago. The strike disrupted the B&O, the Erie and the Pennsylvania railroads, swept up miners, iron workers, longshoremen and canal boatmen, and touched places as far apart as Worcester, Mass., and San Francisco, as far south as Nashville and Galveston, Tex. In some places, the strike erased the color line between white and black workers, at least for a while.\nBy the time the strike was put down, an estimated 100,000 workers had taken part and about 100 people had died. It was the closest the young nation had come to a nationwide general strike and pointed to the need for a more progressive future.\n\u201c[M]any Americans would look back to the summer of 1877 as a turning point,\u201d writes Philip Dray, whose book \u201cThere Is Power in a Union\u201d documents U.S. labor history.\nThe spark came when John W. Garrett, president of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, signed off on a 10 percent wage cut. It knocked a brakeman\u2019s daily wage to $1.35 and was the second such cut in a year. It also came as Americans were still struggling after the Panic of 1873, one of the worst economic skids ever seen.\nB&O workers in Baltimore tried to stage a protest but were thwarted by police. So the action moved down the line to Martinsburg, the terminus of a B&O section.\nOn July 16, a cattle train\u2019s crew walked off the job, leaving the beef to roast in the heat. Then a brakeman led workers in decoupling trains so they couldn\u2019t leave the yard. Police moved in but were driven off. West Virginia Gov. Henry M. Mathews called up the local militia.\nThe militia took command of the cattle train the next day and got it moving, but they were met by strikers, one of whom threw a switch to divert the train. Shots were exchanged: one striker was killed, and a militia member was wounded. Mathews called on President Rutherford B. Hayes to send federal troops. Hayes complied.\nMaj. Gen. W.H. French arrived in Martinsburg with 200 soldiers of the 4th U.S. Artillery and the hope, Dray writes, that a show of bayonets would be enough to restore order. The soldiers, without help from B&O workers, got the trains running.\nBut the strikers began a low-grade guerrilla conflict. Railroad workers \u2014 joined now by miners, iron workers and boatmen from the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal \u2014 hid under bridges or behind blind curves, emerging to ambush trains with stones or block the tracks with debris.\nMaryland Gov. John Lee Carroll, seeing a neighboring state in turmoil, called out the Maryland National Guard in Baltimore and dispatched them to Cumberland, a key B&O junction not far from Martinsburg. As 5th Regiment guardsmen marched from the city\u2019s armory to Camden Station, Baltimore factory workers came into the street to cheer \u2014 until word got out about why the soldiers were mobilized. Soon the cheering crowd became a stone-throwing mob.\nMore troops were summoned, only to make things worse. As the Maryland National Guard\u2019s 6th Regiment followed the same path, thousands of protesters, perhaps tens of thousands \u2014 \u201ca mob, composed of the worst elements in the city,\u201d as the New York Times put it \u2014 let loose with bricks. Some soldiers ran. Others fired into the air. Some fired into the mob, killing 10 people.\nBy now the rage had traveled the rails to Pittsburgh, the country\u2019s industrial heart. Trouble began after the Pennsylvania Railroad ordered that all trains go in \u201cdouble-headers\u201d \u2014 a configuration using two locomotives that forced one crew to do the work of two.\nNot in Pittsburgh, the strikers said. Once again, police were powerless to intervene, and local militia stacked arms in sympathy with the strike. Pennsylvania Gov. John F. Hartranft summoned the National Guard from Philadelphia, the Iron City\u2019s cross-state rival.\nThe Philadelphia troops \u2014 many Civil War veterans \u2014 arrived in a train gouged by stones and chunks of coal dumped on them during the journey. They were heavily armed, with artillery and a Gatling gun. On Saturday, July 21, at the corner of Liberty Avenue and 28th Street, the soldiers clashed with a mob of about 6,000 people. Shots were fired, killing at least 20 people.\nThe crazed mob looted gun shops and weaponized freight cars loaded with coal, setting them on fire and rolling them downhill toward the roundhouse where the soldiers had sheltered. By the next morning, the soldiers had no choice but to flee under fire, and their Gatling gun was put to use. A chunk of the city had been put to the torch.\nChicago was next. Leaders of the Workingmen\u2019s Party \u2014 which was heavily influenced by Marxism and was a forerunner of the Socialist Party \u2014 addressed a crowd of 30,000 people in downtown Chicago to form a \u201cGrand Army of Labor,\u201d Dray writes. \u201cPittsburgh! Pittsburgh! Pittsburgh!\u201d the cry went up. Then violence broke out, and 30 people died.\nIn St. Louis, a relatively peaceful general strike shut down everything \u2014 and for that reason most frightened the leaders of industry, Dray writes. Talk spread of an \u201cAmerican Commune,\u201d and the Workingmen\u2019s Party led 10,000 in a parade singing \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d But martial law was declared, arrests were made, and the Great Strike was on its way to becoming memory.\nAfterward, the railroad barons were unrepentant. The B&O\u2019s Garrett thought the soldiers should have killed more strikers. Others dismissed the unrest as the doings of foreign subversives. Politicians instead focused on strengthening the National Guard, often by building armories. But despite losing the strike, laborers had changed perceptions: In growing numbers, Americans came to believe that government should do more for social justice.\nWho started Labor Day? The bloody and confusing history of an American holiday.", "As a journalist who has recently returned from covering Afghanistan for a major national magazine, and producer of a documentary about Afghan refugees, I must take issue with Robert Coughlin (Letters, Feb. 23), regarding the character of the Afghan resistance against the Soviet invaders.\nI can only conclude that Coughlin's views are based on the scanty information available in the American media. Although there are fanatical elements in the resistance, there are also nationalist, secular, and democratic elements, and the great majority of Afghan freedom fighters are fighting for Islam in the same way that most Americans would fight for their Christianity or Judaism, and for their families.\nWill Coughlin still think the Soviet Union \"the lesser or two evils\" if he knows that one-quarter of the Afghan people now live in exile (3 million in Pakistan, 1.3 million in Iran, and perhaps a million within Afghanistan forced from their home by bombing), and up to half a million have been killed?\nIn many areas of the country, such as the province I visited three months ago, only 10% of the population remains, and these face famine this spring. If only Coughlin could have been with me that November day on a stark, snowy mountainside, hiding under a blanket from Soviet MIGs, and listening to them bomb the same villages that had given me hospitality.\nI would also invite your editorial writers to the same experience. As someone who vehemently opposed U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and equally oppose possible involvement in Nicaragua, I am in an odd position advocating effective arms aid to Afghan freedom fighters. But Afghanistan is the only country in the world invaded by Soviet troops, and if America truly believes in self-determination, it is our moral and humanitarian duty to aid the Afghan people. It is an ethical crime to think in terms of a cynical policy of \"spheres of influence,\" as advocated by the Reagan Administration and your editorial (Feb. 4), \"Getting Too Close.\"", "Here's a list of ten of the top apps released in 2013 for kids ages 3 to 12.\nApps let kids do amazing things.

Also e-mail addresses wouldn't pop up when I attempted to forward an e-mail.\nI called a computer technician based on an ad in the paper. He took my tower with him, rather than spend the time in my home, and when he brought it back it appeared to be fixed.\nThen I noticed he had created another problem where I could not access my bank accounts or anything relating to finances. I couldn't even order anything online. When I try to enter my credit card I get the message \"this page will not display.\" I called him and he came and got the tower a second time.\nBefore he came, I attempted a \"Restore,\" and I was able to get to the financial Web sites, but the original problems resurfaced.

It's better than the Better Business Bureau, if you ask me, because it publishes real user reviews instantaneously. Definitely use this site to review the former tech support person (especially if they're advertising locally).\nDo not spend $250 to fix your computer.

After the second allegation was made on Friday, Fairfax \u2014 the second African-American to ever win statewide office\u2014 was barraged with demands to step down from top Democrats, including a number of presidential hopefuls and most of Virginia\u2019s congressional delegation.\nNortham \u2014 now a year into his four-year term \u2014 has told his top staff he is staying in office and said he wants to focus the rest of his term as governor on taking concrete steps toward increasing racial equality.\nIn his first interview since the scandal erupted, a chastened Northam told the Washington Post that the uproar has pushed him to confront the state\u2019s deep and lingering divisions over race, as well as his own insensitivity.\nHe said that reflection has convinced him that, by remaining in office, he could work to resolve them.\nNortham said he planned to focus on addressing issues stemming from inequality, including improving access to healthcare, housing and transportation.\nHe also repeated his contention that he is not pictured in the photograph on his yearbook page that shows someone in blackface standing alongside someone in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe.\nYet he could not explain how the photograph wound up there, or why he initially had taken responsibility for it.\nAttorney General Mark Herring has since acknowledged wearing blackface at a college party in 1980.\nHerring \u2014 who would become governor if both Northam and Fairfax resign \u2014 had previously called on Northam to resign and came forward after rumors about the existence of a blackface photograph of him began circulating at the Capitol.", "Michael Owen insists David Moyes will come through the rocky start to his Manchester United career and prove to be the right choice to replace Sir Alex Ferguson.\nUnited have suffered three defeats in their opening six Barclays Premier League games to leave Moyes reeling.\nSome fans have been critical of his team selection, in particular his use of Shinji Kagawa and decision not to give new boy Wilfried Zaha any time on the pitch.\nOthers acknowledge the squad Moyes inherited is nowhere near as strong as last season's 11-point title win indicated, a fact the Scot himself has seemed to endorse over the weekend.\nIn addition, Eric Steele has claimed Moyes went against the advice of Ferguson by dispensing with the services of the former goalkeeping coach and senior coaches Rene Meulensteen and Mike Phelan in the summer, denying United the continuity that could be invaluable at the present time.\nIt has created a pretty unhappy backdrop ahead of Wednesday night's Champions League encounter with Shakhtar Donetsk, who slammed five past Real Sociedad in their opening Group A game a fortnight ago.\nYet Owen, who spent three years with the Old Trafford outfit before leaving for Stoke in 2012, insists Moyes will eventually get it right.\n\"It was always going to change quite dramatically,\" he told fifa.com.\n\"When someone has been there for over 25 years, whoever was going to take the job was going to have big question marks put against them.\n\"It was going to be a change for everybody within the club.\n\"Manchester United have appointed the right man in David Moyes, he has had a good career so far and has done fantastically well at Everton.\n\"In time he will prove to be a very good choice.\n\"They've had a bit of a slow start to the season, but they've had a difficult start to the season.\n\"I'm sure they'll get it right though and will still be one of the main challengers at the end of the season.\"\nThat opinion is not shared by the bookmakers, who have pushed United out to fourth favourites for the title at odds that would suggest they are expected to be battling with Tottenham for the final Champions League berth.\nUnited did make a winning start to their European campaign, though, by beating Bayer Leverkusen and will have Nani back from suspension in Ukraine this week.", "Forty years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, the storied organizations that propelled the modern-day civil rights movement alongside him are either struggling to stay relevant or struggling to stay alive.\nIn Atlanta, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) -- which was founded in 1957 after Alabama's Montgomery bus boycott and was led by King through the most difficult days of the movement -- clings to life. Three years ago, utilities shut off the lights and the phones when the group did not pay its bills.\nIn New York, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), which helped shape the movement's philosophy after adopting Mohandas K. Gandhi's doctrine of nonviolent protest, is scarcely known outside Manhattan. CORE conceded that it now has about 10 percent of the 150,000 members it listed in the 1960s.\nIn Baltimore, the near-century-old NAACP, which tore down racial barriers with deft lawyering in the courts, recently cut a third of its administrative staff because of budget shortfalls. For decades, the NAACP asserted that it was the largest civil rights group, with about half a million dues-paying members, but one of its former presidents recently acknowledged that it has fewer than 300,000.\nSome groups have disappeared, such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which organized the Freedom Rides that drew sympathy to their cause and which was later led by firebrands such as Stokley Carmichael and H. Rap Brown. Others, such as the National Urban League, remain viable but have diminished visibility.\n\"They don't really exist now,\" said the Rev. C.T. Vivian, a former interim director of the SCLC, who spoke with pain in his voice. He added: \"They're just names. There has been so little activity from so many of them. SCLC rose from the dead, but we're not so certain life has been blown into it yet. And the NAACP is vital, but they're not doing what I'd expect.\"\nThe groups' decline has been slow but inexorably driven by factors both within and outside their control. They were the subjects of government spying and harassment. A proliferation of black organizations with niche audiences -- lawyers, engineers, accountants, journalists -- took away middle-class members. The rise in the 1970s of groups such as the Black Panthers, which espoused a melodramatic militancy, made them seem tepid.\nSome activists say that the more traditional civil rights groups may be victims of their greatest successes: the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act of the mid-1960s. Those laws paved the way for an exploding number of African American politicians who seized a share of the leadership. Today, radio deejays, Internet groups such as Color of Change.org and organizations such as the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights are orchestrating bus rides, marches and other actions once performed by civil rights groups.\nAs the groups were drained of power, they sometimes hurt themselves. CORE's most charismatic liberal leader, James Farmer, resigned and was replaced by a conservative. The NAACP fired an executive director in 1994 for using its money to settle a sexual harassment suit against him.\nAnd for decades, the groups did not employ more sophisticated marketing and membership tools used by other organizations, such as AARP and the National Rifle Association.\n\"Not enough of us had recognized change,\" CORE Chairman Roy Innis said. \"We were spoiled by the heyday of the civil rights movement, where attention came whether we recruited or not.\"\nOthers involved in the groups are critical of their status today.\nJoAnn Watson, a Detroit City Council member who ran the local NAACP office in the 1990s, said the organizations are living off their reputations. \"They benefit from the name that has been earned by the blood of the ancestors,\" she said.\nMichael Meyers, a former NAACP executive, recalled when the group's initials inspired fear. \"People answered the phones; they thought they were going to be sued,\" he said. \"But not now.\"\nThe drop in stature may have been inevitable, said Roger Wilkins, an assistant attorney general under President Lyndon B. Johnson who advised the groups. \"Black people didn't have opportunities in the '30s and '40s and '50s,\" he said. \"They couldn't be mayors, so they became presidents of black colleges or leaders of civil rights organizations. But at the end of the '60s, all kinds of pathways opened up, and civil rights organizations had to compete for leadership.\"\nWith advances in education, employment and buying power, some have argued, civil rights organizations have become passe. But group leaders bristle at the notion.\nA report released this week by the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank, said that black America remains troubled. Despite marginal advances in education and jobs, the income gap between black and white Americans has grown so large since King's death that it would take more than 500 years for black people to catch up under the current pace of change, the report said. The divide between black and white wealth is so wide that achieving parity would take more than 600 years.\nOrganization leaders said that they have made mistakes since King's death but that they were also weakened by outside forces. As the White House was enacting civil rights laws, the FBI was infiltrating organizations under the secret Counter Intelligence Program known as COINTELPRO. After the 1970s, media attention turned away from the civil rights movement, the group leaders said.\nIneffective marketing and the lack of coverage led to public apathy, Innis said. \"The lessening of attention and accurate reporting of our activities made it difficult to point out our civil rights victory and the new direction we were moving in,\" he said.\nCharles Steele, president and chief executive of the SCLC, acknowledged that squabbling nearly doomed his organization. But, he said, the SCLC is coming back.

It certainly could be since appendicitis is the most common abdominal emergency, according to the International Journal of Surgery.\n\"Appendicitis is still very common, with more than 200,000 cases a year in the U.S. typically,\" said Dr. Amanda Magrini, M.D., a doctor in family medicine at Northern Nevada Medical Center. \"[It is] one of the most common causes of the sudden onset of abdominal pain, particularly between the ages of 5 and 40. There has been a sharp decrease in the number of deaths in the U.S. from awareness and general health, but overall, there is no way to prevent getting appendicitis.\"\nThe appendix is a tiny pinky-sized pouch that hangs at the end of the right side of the colon, where it meets up with the small intestine, according to Magrini. It resembles a little tube, closed at the bottom.\n\"It has no absolute known function,\" she said.\nAppendicitis typically arises from an acute inflammation of this pouch. The appendix can become inflamed as result of stool being impacted in the area and causing an infection while cutting off blood flow. Appendicitis could also result from a general infection or even a chronic inflammation, such as Crohn's disease, according to Magrini.\nThere are many signs of appendicitis, but these can vary from person to person, according to The Mayo Clinic. Reported symptoms include sudden pain on the right side in the lower abdomen area, pain that becomes worse with movement, such as coughing or walking, or even nausea or vomiting, according to The Mayo Clinic.\nPeople may also experience abdominal bloating, constipation, diarrhea or a low-grade fever that worsens with time.\n\"[Appendicitis] usually starts with pain around the belly button that moves to the right lower side of the abdomen, associated with nausea, vomiting and a lack of appetite,\" Magrini said. \"In rare cases, it can cause a more chronic discomfort in the right lower side of the abdomen, but this is much less common.\"\nShe points out that diet is not known to have a direct impact on the occurrence of appendicitis and that it is slightly more common in men than in women as well as those typically in their teens to 20s.\nBecause appendicitis can cause serious complications, particularly if the appendix ruptures, immediate care should be a priority. Antibiotics and removal of the appendix through surgery are the common forms of treatment, reports the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, or NIDDK, a branch of the National Institutes of Health. The removal of the appendix is known as an appendectomy.\nTo take out the appendix, surgeons may opt for a laparotomy, which is the removal of the appendix through a single incision. According to the NIDDK, another option is laparoscopic surgery, which utilizes smaller incisions and special tools to remove the appendix. Of the two options, laparoscopic surgery usually leads to fewer complications and a quicker recovery time, according to the NIDDK.\n\"Appendicitis is a surgical emergency, and if suspected should always be evaluated by a physician,\" said Magrini. \"There are rare cases where appendicitis may be treated with just antibiotics, but the majority of the time emergency surgery to remove the appendix is required.\"\nIndividuals who have had their appendix removed usually do not have a long recovery time, but may have to restrict their physical activity for up to two weeks, reports the NIDDK.", "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 With just over a minute left and No. 11 Florida State rapidly closing the gap, an unlikely contributor popped onto the court to help Boston College hold on for a victory.\nRunning back AJ Dillon, the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s preseason football player of the year, got out of his courtside seat and wiped down the floor while the teams lined up for a free throw, drawing a chuckle and a cheer from the crowd.\nBut freshman Wynston Tabbs made a 3-pointer with 24 seconds remaining to turn back the rally and snap the Eagles\u2019 five-game losing streak.

Instead, its struggles deepened as the Terrapins swept the Hawkeyes.\nHawkeye standout Cali Hoye was absent again in this match.\nThe Terrapins soundly handled the Hawkeyes in the first set, 25-19. Iowa hitting was abysmal, at .067 percent.\nThe Hawkeyes led for most of the second set, sparking some hope. This was largely due to Reghan Coyle, one of the few Hawkeyes who generated some production. Coyle put up 12 kills on the night with only 5 errors, a solid showing.\nThe Hawkeyes were able to leap out to a 15-9 lead in the second set through efforts from Coyle, Meghan Buzzerio, and Brie Orr. However, the Terrapins caught fire and roared back to a 25-22 win on kills from Erika Pritchard and Hawkeye mistakes.\nIowa saw a momentum loss after losing the big lead to Maryland in the second set.\nA 5-point run in the middle of the third set gave the Terrapins the edge and eventually the win, 25-21. The Hawkeyes suffered a large blocking disparity against the Terrapins, 12-2. This was largely due to the efforts from Maryland freshman Rainelle Jones, who tallied 8.\nIowa has not won the blocking battle in any of its last five matches.\nAlso on Oct. 28, the large number of Hawkeye errors led to a meager hitting percentage of .090.\nThe lagging Hawkeyes were unable to contest the Terrapin offensive play. Iowa only put up 2 blocks as Maryland ran the table with a .214 hitting percentage. Pritchard had a big day for the Terrapins with 20 kills.\nThe team\u2019s struggles really began when Hoye missed her first matches against Wisconsin and Minnesota last week. These three matches all ended in three-set losses for Iowa.\nHer absence has affected the rest of her team, as well. Star hitter Taylor Louis has been very quiet in the last few matches, only putting up 5 kills in the loss to Maryland. Louis does not normally experience scoring droughts like this; the fire that Hoye brings to matches could be a cause of Louis\u2019 struggles.\nThe team seems to be hobbling to the season\u2019s finish line. There was a lot of hope for the team after its upset of top-10 Wisconsin earlier this season, with thoughts of a postseason berth looming on the horizon.\nThe five-match losing streak has all but quashed these hopes.\nSome hope remains, however, as the squad has big-time matches coming up in the next few weeks; Purdue, Nebraska, and Penn State remain on the schedule, and if the Hawkeyes can muster up some wins, the season may yet be saved.\n\u201cOur team continues to battle and work hard, and coming up with victories on the road is always a challenge in the Big Ten,\u201d head coach Bond Shymansky said in a release.", "A member of the in-theater camcording gang known as the IMAGiNE Group was handed a 40-month prison term Thursday in what is the nation's longest sentence in a file-sharing case.\nA Virginia federal judge handed the term to Gregory A.

Truman Union Station? Senators want to rename D.C.\u2019s train hub.\nRonald Reagan's name is already on the name of a local airport, so why not also name the train station for a former president?\nThat's what Missouri Sens. Claire McCaskill (D) and Roy Blunt (R) hope to do as they introduced a measure Thursday that would rename Washington's Union Station for former president Harry S. Truman. The bill's introduction is timed to Truman's 130th birthday, which is today.\nThe proposal to rename the District's main train hub for an out-of-town resident might bring pause to some locals. On Thursday afternoon, D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), who has taken pains to fight Congress for greater budget and governing autonomy, issued a statement saying the District ought to have some say. \"Any name change should be made in collaboration and consultation with the residents and government of the District of Columbia,\" he said.\nBut Union Station is owned by the federal government, so Congress has the right to name the station whatever it wants. McCaskill and Blunt both serve on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over such proposals.\nSo why name Union Station for Truman? The senators noted that the station once housed U.S. Car No. 1, or the presidential rail car, which Truman used for his \"whistle-stop campaign\" tour, which started and ended at Union Station. Once Truman left town in 1953, he departed Washington from Union Station by train, and 5,000 people showed up to say goodbye, according to the senators.\nThe proposal is an especially important one for McCaskill, whose office is decorated with a Truman bust, photos of the late president and even a \"The Buck Stops Here\" name plate on her desk. She said Thursday that she wanted to give Truman the honor because while several sites in Washington are named for former presidents, nothing is named for Truman. \"I hear Republicans all the time comparing themselves to Harry Truman. So I figured, with so many people wanting to grab Harry Truman\u2019s mantle, this could turn into a great bipartisan effort,\" she said.\nDespite McCaskill's suggestion, the main building housing the State Department in Washington is named for Truman.\nMcCaskill credited the former president for a \"plain-spoken and straight-forward\" approach. \"He wasn\u2019t concerned about his approval ratings. He recognized Israel, he integrated the armed services. When he integrated the armed services it was a terribly unpopular thing to do but it was the right thing to do and he didn\u2019t care what the approval ratings said,\" she said.\nAcknowledging that some critics might be concerned about naming the train station for the first U.S. president to order the use of an atomic bomb, McCaskill said, \"He saved thousands of lives by making that decision, it was a very difficult decision it was obviously horrific that that happened, but I think most historians would weigh in and say that the decision was made to save lives, not take lives.\"\nThe sprawling train station houses roughly 140 shops and restaurants and is in the midst of a $35 million renovation that will reposition its merchant mix with a concentration on food options -- a big need in an area of town near famous landmarks but devoid of affordable eating options for tourists. The station has also become a major bus hub and is home to one of the Metro system's most well-used subway stops.\nIn 2012, Amtrak proposed a $7 billion expansion of the station that it said could triple passenger capacity and transform the overcrowded station into a high-speed rail hub.\nMore recent renovations include repairs of damage caused by the 2011 earthquake and the addition of new stores such as H&M. But the station and its manager, the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., have not always enjoyed sound financial footing.\nThe nonprofit USRC sued the city in 2011 over a tax dispute, and, last month, an audit by the Department of Transportation's inspector general found that a USRC maintenance fund was in danger of facing a $5 million shortfall by this fall.\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D.C.), who requested the audit, said it showed that USRC \"has many major problems for which solutions have not been developed.\"\nBeverley Swaim-Staley, president and chief executive of USRC, said the capital maintenance fund was just one source of revenue for the organization and that the shortfall resulted from a long-term lease USRC had signed years before.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy now to say, 'wow, it\u2019s a very successful retail space, and it\u2019s a hot neighborhood,' but that\u2019s not what it was when the lease was signed,\" she said when the report came out.\nSwaim-Staley declined to comment on the name proposal on Thursday. \"Since the building is owned by USDOT, it is really a discussion for them,\" she said in an e-mail.", "She won more than $105,000, money she\u2019d told producers she intended to donate to cancer charities.\nStowell, who died days before her first \u201cJeopardy!\u201d episode aired earlier this month, had been battling Stage 4 cancer when the shows were taped in late August.\nHer boyfriend told KXAN being on the show was Stowell\u2019s lifelong dream.\n12/15 update: Cindy Stowell picked up another $8,600 in winnings today.\n12/14 update: In her second day on \u201cJeopardy!\u201d Austin\u2019s Cindy Stowell won $8,199, placing first.

Ltd to design the Kharghar business park. Once it\u2019s built, it will be open for leasing or selling to companies. At present, Cidco operates two IT parks with a total of 1.6 million sq ft office space, at Vashi and Belapur (in Navi Mumbai). Both these parks are fully occupied.\nReal estate consultants estimate that demand for office space would jump further because of the upcoming Navi Mumbai International airport, apart from improved rail and road connectivity.\nGautam Saraf, managing director (Mumbai) of property advisory Cushman and Wakefield, said office space absorption in Navi Mumbai jumped from 300,000 sq ft to 1-1.5 million sq ft in the last five years.\nRecently, Singapore-based Ascendas Singbridge bought two under-construction office buildings for Rs930 crore from real estate firm Aurum Venture, which is building a 5 million sq ft IT park called Q PAR\u0106 at Ghansoli in Navi Mumbai. K Raheja Corp, which is one of the largest commercial office developers in the region and operates three IT parks under the Mindspace and Gigaplex brands, is adding 2-3 million sq ft to its portfolio.\n\u201cThe growth of this micro-market is also driven by the combination of cost-effective rentals and availability of good human resource,\" said Vinod Rohira, managing director, K Raheja Corp. More than 70 large IT and financial companies, including Accenture, L&T Infotech, Capgemini, UBS and Axis Bank, operate out of these parks.\nSanjay Dasgupta, chief executive officer of Ascendas Property Fund Trustee Pte Ltd, said multinational companies (MNCs) have started accepting Navi Mumbai as a viable location over the last three years.\n\u201cWe are also seeing rentals in Navi mumbai shooting up to Rs50-52 per sq ft from Rs27-28 per sq ft about six-seven years ago,\" he said.\nMumbai-based Raheja Universal is building its first commercial office portfolio with plans to set up Raheja District, a mixed-use office park with around 15 million sq ft space, at Juinagar. The 100-acre office park will also have the World Trade Centre (WTC) towers.\n\u201cConstruction of the towers will start post monsoon,\" said Ashish Raheja, managing director, Raheja Universal.\nNot only Mumbai developers, but large Bengaluru and Pune-based firms like Embassy Group and Panchshil Realty have been scouting for space in Navi Mumbai to set up IT and industrial parks.\nGlobal firms, including Taiwan-based Foxconn and Sweden\u2019s furniture company IKEA, are on their way to set up shop in the country within the region. Foxconn has leased around 2 lakh sq ft in Raheja District to set up a facility to assemble mobile phones. IKEA is opening its second store in India, at Navi Mumbai, with an investment of Rs1,000 crore.\n\u201cCompared to other strong IT corridors in the country, land prices are still cheap here. The ballpark range for land transaction in the area is about $1 million per acre. With that kind of a price, it is a very lucrative market,\" Saraf said.", "SOA \u2013 Integration or Interaction?\nSOA and integration have been working together so well that we tend to forget that SOA is not just about integrating and we often refer to SOA itself as mainly an integration architecture. The word \u2018integration\u2019 has been used for decades to describe the possibility for systems to interact, which makes it confusing when applying it to the SOA domain where it might be relevant to distinguish between integrating and interacting.\nThe point is that integration and interaction are two different things but how they differ depends on the way you define integration.\nThere are those that mean that two systems communicating with each other are in fact \u2018integrating' (that's the traditional approach) and integration solutions are the components making this communication possible. I'd say that these systems are interacting instead, the use they do of the result of the interaction and the interaction's scope/context determine whether they are integrating or just interacting.\nIt's interesting to notice how the word \u2018integration' took over different meanings within and outside the IT world. As mentioned, \u2018integrating' in IT often means that two entities come in contact in some way. Applied to another domain the distinction between integration and interaction is easier to see: when speaking of immigration for example, integration means that the ones immigrating become part of the country they move to, sharing it's culture, values etc. Interacting on the other hand simply means you come in contact with something, like going on holiday abroad, thus \u2018using', not creating any kind of permanent binding between you and the country you visit. Projecting the same principle to the IT domain it becomes more clear that using a service doesn't necessarily mean that you integrate with the system hosting it, you just interact with it through the service.\nWhat does integrating mean then? Roughly, it means that two \u2018entities' have something in common, that they share something more or less persistently. Interacting, on the other hand, means that two entities come in contact (temporarily) in some way.\nBut what is this \u2018something' characterizing SOA integration?\nThat depends on the type of service. Looking at the distinction between infrastructure services and information services (where - roughly - information services have to do with information manipulation and infrastructure services perform some kind of operation) you see that in information services the integration taking place is an information-integration whereas in an infrastructure service the interaction might belong to a process integration. I'll try to explain.\nInformation services are used to retrieve information from systems/components etc., that information is often stored in the consumer's environment and reused thereby integrating the origin and destination systems information-wise, meaning that the information they share is what makes them \u2018integrated'.\nIn infrastructure services the integration is often on a process level, meaning that the services belong (or contribute) to the same process.\nA third type of integration is domain/scope-level integration, where several services are utilized within the same domain, for example an application using external services, the fact that the services are being used in the same context (the application) makes them integrated.\nHaving roughly clarified (and accepted) the distinction between integration and interaction it becomes more clear that SOA is not integration, even though information services are perhaps the most common in SOA implementations and they are often used in information-integrations.\nOf course, interacting with a service makes two entities (the consumer and the provider) in some way logically \u2018integrated' as they use the same functionality and they therefore have something in common (they share the \u2018use' of the same functionality), but it's important to point out that we are speaking of logical integration and most importantly it has nothing to do with SOA or the architecture used but with the functionality itself. The service provider might not even use that same functionality that the client is using.\nBesides different kinds of integrations there are several degrees of integration as well.\nA web application needing to display information from some source will temporarily interact with the required service in order to get that information, use it and disregard it, thus it will \u2018consume' (or interact with) the service and the information but it won't integrate with the system hosting the service. Even on a logical level the integration is very loose as the front-end is merely presenting the data, still you could say that there is a logical integration taking place as the service provider is now part of the application's flow.\nIf that same application was to save the data locally and most importantly was to reuse the data from the local storage rather than fetching the data from the originating system then we'd have a higher level of information integration (physical). The data the systems share is what integrates them. The more the information is reused the more the systems are integrated and if the system originally holding the information updates it (when changed) in the destination system then the integration gets even tighter.\nStill, from a SOA point of view these systems integrations are in fact just interactions.\nSo why does SOA almost always turn up when speaking of integration? For a couple of reasons, the first being that SOA in it's nature makes it trivial to interact and therefore is the basis for building integrations and the second being the semantical non-distinction between integrating and interacting.\nFurthermore, as information services are probably the most commonly used in SOAs and since these are often used in information and process integration we often tend to see SOA as integration as well.\nI believe that the distinction between interaction and integration in SOA should be more evident, as they are in fact not only two different things but reside in two different abstraction levels. Integration might rely on a SOA or on any other architecture in order to work properly.\nSOA in it's simplest form is services and services are not about integrating (thus the result of the interaction), services CAN be used to integrate but they are primarily a way to interact with the service provider.\nEven though the difference between integration and interaction might seem subtle and more of a semantic kind there it is indeed important to keep it in mind when designing your architecture.\nESBs are for example often regarded as integration components whereas they are in fact just used to transparently enable interaction whereas there are specific products (integration platforms) providing tailored integration capabilities.\nAristo Togliatti works as an IT Architect for the Swedish Railways (SJ).

Investors have abruptly sold Italian assets \u2013 a trend that continued on Wednesday, with shares falling and bond yields rising in a reflection of economic uncertainty.\nHowever Eurosceptic politicians from across the continent have hailed the ascent of Five Star and the League \u2013 the first time one of the euro zone\u2019s largest economies will be government by such avowedly anti-establishment parties.\nThe mandate handed to Mr Conte on Wednesday night is not final. The law professor from the University of Florence \u2013 who hails from a small town in the southern province of Puglia \u2013 will have to return to Mr Mattarella with an acceptable slate of ministers to fill key cabinet positions.\nIf Mr Mattarella does not agree with the names, a stand-off could ensue.\nDoubts have already surfaced over Five Star and the League\u2019s proposal of Paolo Savona, an octogenarian Eurosceptic economist, for the key position of finance minister.

But he won, in large part because of older male voters.\nHowever, other groups did not share in that support. One of them was American college students, mostly female students.\nIn fact, a new study found that more first-year female students at U.S. colleges and universities now identify themselves as liberal than ever before. It also suggests the difference in the number of all first-year female and male students identifying as liberal is the biggest ever measured.\nThe study comes from the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA, the University of California in Los Angeles.\nResearchers launched the study in 1966. They ask first-time, full-time students at four-year colleges and universities around the country about different subjects. Last year, the study gathered information from over 137,000 students at 184 different schools.\nOne of the subjects the study asks about is U.S. politics. The study asks college students to identify themselves politically in one of five groupings. They are liberal; extreme liberal or \u201cfar left\u201d; conservative; extreme conservative or \u201cfar right\u201d; and moderate or \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201d Since the beginning of the study, moderate students have always been, and still are, the largest group.\nBut in 2016, 41.1 percent of the female students in the study identified themselves as liberal or far left. This is the largest percentage of young women identifying as liberal in the over 50 year history of the study. By comparison, just 28.9 percent of males identified their political thinking as liberal or far left.\nAround 27 percent of male students and about 18 percent of female students identified themselves as conservative or far right.\nKevin Eagan is an assistant professor at UCLA. He also is the managing director of the Higher Education Research Institute. He says the number of female college students identifying as liberal has been rising since the 1990s.\n\u200bThere have been periods when male students were more liberal than females, such as during the 1960s and 1970s. But Eagan notes the number of young people identifying with one party over another has a lot to do with the politicians who represent those parties.\nFor example, the Republican Party chose former California governor Ronald Reagan as its presidential candidate in 1980. Reagan was elected and served eight years in the White House. Information collected during that period showed large decreases in the number of liberal college students.\nKevin Eagan believes that many young women likely identified with Hillary Clinton last year because she was a woman. Clinton was the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, which has supported more liberal policies in recent years than the Republicans.\nEagan says Trump also likely pushed women to the left through his actions and statements about women. For example, during the 2016 election campaign, news media uncovered a recording of Trump from several years earlier. In the recording, he made jokes about inappropriate contact with woman. Several other women came forward and accused him of sexual wrongdoing. Trump and his campaign denied the sexual misconduct claims.\n\"With a candidate last year on the Republican side who was characterized by the media, perhaps rightfully so, as misogynistic and not really supportive of women \u2026 I think that that just served to exacerbate this trend that we\u2019re seeing related to women \u2026 shifting their political perspectives.\"\nNesha Ruther, first-year student at the University of Wisconsin.\nBut college student Nesha Ruther says she does not identify as liberal simply because the more liberal presidential candidate was a woman. Ruther is from Takoma Park, Maryland. She began taking classes at the University of Wisconsin in 2016. She is a registered Democrat.\nRuther wanted Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to serve as the party\u2019s candidate last November. She says she did so because of his support of issues like ending police violence against African Americans and raising taxes on the wealthy.\nAfter Sanders lost the nomination to Clinton, Ruther grew concerned about Trump\u2019s calls to limit public money for healthcare services that mainly serve women. She also opposed his calls to restrict medical operations for ending a pregnancy. So the Maryland woman supported Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\nRuther argues that many women choose to identify as liberal because of their position on issues that most affect them. This includes making sure women are paid the same as men for the same work, and that women should be included in making decisions on rules affecting reproductive health.\n\"In this day and age, liberalism \u2026 is more appealing to women because it is a movement that is for progress. So it\u2019s not the way things have been previously, and in that way it is more geared towards the empowerment of women, the increased social mobility of women.\"\nHans Noel teaches political science at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He notes that liberals are not the majority among American women.\nHans Noel, professor of political science at Georgetown University.\n\u200bIn fact, the Washington Post newspaper reported that 61 percent of white women without a college degree voted for Trump. But many more young women in recent years identify themselves as feminists and support politicians who support women\u2019s rights.\nNoel says the political right in the U.S. has grown increasingly conservative, especially on issues like access to birth control. And the political left has grown more feminist.\n\"What it means to be liberal, conservative, what it means to be Democratic or Republican, it evolves and changes. And it\u2019s not like that suddenly being liberal has been pro-feminist, suddenly. That\u2019s been around for a while. But that certainly has been a highlighted issue in the last several years, and particularly the last election.\"\nNoel adds that colleges and universities are often places that support more liberal ways of thinking. And it is almost natural that young women would side with whatever political movement they feel most supports their needs.\nBut he says the most important thing to consider is not their political opinions, but whether or not younger Americans will vote in elections. People between 18 and 35 years old represent 31 percent of the voters nationwide. But only about half of them voted in 2016.\nPete Musto reported this story for VOA Learning English.

The shape will also dictate the persistence and display of bubbles; the narrower and taller the glass, the smaller the ratio of air to wine, keeping those cheeky bubbles alive for longer.\nThe most famous of champagne\u2019s glasses has to be the shallow coupe, said to be modelled on the breasts of France\u2019s queen Marie Antoinette. Although this glass was actually created specifically for sparkling wine in England in the 1690s, I still like to think Marie Antoinette\u2019s desirable bosom had a part to play in the design.\nThe coupe became hugely popular in the UK, the States and Russia, glamorised by champagne houses, including Veuve Clicquot. The problem with the coupe glass is that it\u2019s too short and too wide. Once poured, the champagne goes flat a little too quickly.\nFlutes are popular because they showcase the tiny, gently rising bubbles up the sides of a tall, narrow glass, thus continuing champagne\u2019s visual appeal. The best flutes have etching in the bottom of the glass to act as a nucleation point for the steady, even stream of bubbles. Another major plus for the flute is that it\u2019s much harder to spill your precious fizz out of the glass.\nBut although flutes are visually pleasing, they do not best showcase the quality of champagne in the glass; in fact they impede it. They are fine for simple fizzers at parties, but if you have a special bottle you want to savour, then flutes will literally restrict the flavour.\nLike fine wine, a certain amount of oxygen is needed to open and aerate the aromas and flavours of champagne. The shape of the flute inhibits the style, and can hide the taste. I\u2019m happier drinking my champers out of normal wine glasses, so I can fully appreciate the aromas and tastes released in the glass. I recommend you follow suit.\nWith the shift away from flutes and coupes, many of the top champagne houses have devised bespoke glasses for their own top cuv\u00e9es (the blends). The result is a tulip-shaped glass which offers the best of both flutes and wine glasses.\nThe shape of the tulip glass gives more air to the surface of the champagne, thus allowing more of the fizzy aromas to escape, then cleverly tapers around the rim to allow each one of the bubbles to burst simultaneously at the glass\u2019s widest point.\nSo, when you stick your nose in for a whiff, you get maximum flavour and aromas from the bursting champagne bubbles. BOOM!\nMany sparkling wines, especially champagnes, have taken years or decades to make. It would be a shame to undo all that time in a few seconds by using the wrong vessel. So, next time you pop a cork, do yourself a flavour favour and use a proper glass.\n101 Champagnes And Other Sparkling Wines To Try Before You Die by Davy Zyw, is published by Birlinn.

Such an appointment may be seen as more of a gimmick appointment than a serious, business-savvy addition to the board of directors. Shaq\u2019s public image as the sports-star turned lighthearted commercial pitchman might initially be seen as consistent with that view. Indeed, his new relationship reportedly extends beyond board service to include promotional services and investment in nine of its restaurants.\nBut a closer look at the Papa John\u2019s decision suggests two important governance lessons that offer a more positive view on the recruitment of celebrity directors.\nThe first lesson is that celebrity board service in today\u2019s multi-layered competitive environment should not be dismissed out-of-hand. Shaq is no business lightweight. He reportedly has degrees from both LSU and University of Phoenix and has shrewdly built himself to become a post-Hall of Famer entrepreneur. He projects the ability to succeed in the boardroom, as he did on the hardwood. In addition, his appointment contributes to board diversity, both as to race but also as to experience and perspectives, all of which offer great value to the Papa John\u2019s brand. It appears to be a thoughtful appointment.\nIndeed, there have always been individuals whose business acumen matched, or exceeded, their celebrity accomplishments. In years past, Arnold Palmer and Paul Newman launched highly successful personal branded products. More recent examples of celebrity/entrepreneurs include Jessica Alba (co-founder of a baby skin products company) and Gwyneth Paltrow (recently profiled in the New York Times as the Goop CEO). Jay-Z is widely acknowledged as a successful entrepreneur across multiple industries. And, of course, Oprah Winfrey is not only one of the most influential people in the world, she controls her own television network and multimedia company.\nFrom that perspective, Shaq\u2019s board appointment is more of a tip-in and less of a Hail Mary in terms of governance controversy. But of course there are also scores of celebrities whose business ventures have been wildly unsuccessful.\nThus, the second lesson is that the appointment of a celebrity is not automatically a slam dunk, whether in terms of transition to the board or of ultimate success as a director. The fundamental question is whether the company\u2019s governance needs are best served by appointment of a celebrity in general, and the celebrity in particular. In the Papa John\u2019s situation, that requirement appears to have been met given Shaq\u2019s unique skillset.\nFollowing that, a careful background examination is an additional prerequisite. This, not only for matters of potential controversy and conflict, but also in order to confirm the bona fides of the celebrity\u2019s business experience. Next should come serious discussions with respect to engagement. Today\u2019s competitive and regulatory environment allow no room for figurehead directors. Will the celebrity be able to commit to the task? Are there too many competing responsibilities?\nThis should be followed by aggressive onboarding efforts, likely beyond that which is necessary for more traditional appointees. The celebrity director should be trained in the nature of the company, its business model, the industry and the competitive landscape in which the company operates and key legal and regulatory issues, among other topics. Given the celebrity\u2019s public profile, particular training on confidentiality and other duty of loyalty considerations will be important.\nThe independence of the celebrity director will need to be considered when he or she is also called upon to play a role in, and be separately compensated for, prominent promotional activity on behalf of the company.\nAny initial controversy associated with Shaq\u2019s appointment to the Papa John\u2019s board dims on greater examination of the circumstances. When thoughtfully conceived and properly executed, the use of celebrity directors can certainly be consistent with effective governance. When improperly conceived or executed, however, it can result in boardroom dysfunction. In a sense, it\u2019s like in-game decision-making. For simple plays, hand signals from the bench may be all that\u2019s necessary. But for the complex plays, the coach is more likely going to take a full time out and call the team to the sidelines.", "Body cam footage released recently by Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett shows a police shooting which resulted in the wounding of a 9-year-old girl and the family dog as officers responded to a domestic dispute and suicide call, according to CBS News.\nThe initial portion showing officers entering the residence is silent, with audio picking up as they enter the home. Inside, they find four children in the living room and a 35-pound English bull terrier with black and white markings. The children are crying but the dog appears to be silent. As officers check the home for the parties to the alleged domestic dispute, finding nobody, the officer wearing the body cam returns to the living room before turning to go down another hallway.\n\u201cOK. We\u2019ve got a dog inside here, too,\u201d the officer says with a slight chuckle. The dog starts barking, agitated, and two gunshots are fired by Officer Dexter Betts, the officer which appears to be behind the body cam. The dog disappears, silent, and the young girl starts shrieking.\n\u201cOw! Ow! You hurt my eye! Ow! Ow!\u201d the child cries, wounded by a bullet fragment which had ricocheted and struck her in the forehead above her right eye.\nWhen officers had arrived on scene regarding the suicide call, in which the mother of the young girl had told 911 that her husband was in the bedroom with a gun in his mouth, they found the man unarmed and standing in the driveway with his hands up. On scene were Betts and another unnamed officer. That is when the body cam footage, and the dreadful scene which occurred shortly thereafter, began.\nBetts has since been charged with one count of aggravated battery, a level 8 felony, for the affair. He has entered a not guilty plea in preliminary hearings that are also partially responsible for the public release of the body cam footage.\nThe footage was withheld from the media until it was presented in open court and was released to the media on the decision of the Sedgwick County District Attorney.\nThis case is widely believed to be the first time in two decades where a member of Wichita\u2019s law enforcement arm faces criminal charges for a serious on-duty shooting which resulted in an injury or death.\nAt Betts\u2019 hearing last week, the DA argued that Betts acted recklessly and showed a lack of care for the girl\u2019s life when he discharged his weapon twice at the dog, failing to judge the distance from the girl and lacking a clear background. Betts\u2019 defense counsel disagreed, stating that the officer \u201cacknowledged the danger\u201d of a charging dog and acted quickly in response.\nWhile the felony case continues, there have already been significant repercussions for the officer in question. Betts was fired by the Wichita Police Department on January 25 of this year, according to The Wichita Eagle.", "eWEEK begins the hunt for high-tech watchers who don't believe Yahoo started its slow death march after striking its search and search ad deal with Microsoft. Search Engine Land, Reuters, TechCrunch and opinionated company leaders believe Yahoo has given up its search engine ghost. Finally, eWEEK finds one analyst who likes the deal.\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find someone who doesn't believe Yahoo engaged in slow-moving suicide with the 10-year search and search ad deal it struck with Microsoft July 29.\nFor starters, there was no upfront payment of billions of dollars, despite early reports claiming Microsoft would pay Yahoo $3 billion upfront.\nMicrosoft, whose Bing search share is 8.4 percent, agreed to power Yahoo's search and search ads on the back end with Bing. Yahoo, the No. 2 player in search at 19.6 percent, will gain a respectable share of the search ad sales.\nMicrosoft will pay Yahoo traffic acquisition costs (TACs) at a rate of 88 percent of search revenue generated on Yahoo's sites for the first five years of the agreement. Microsoft will guarantee Yahoo's revenue per search in each country for the first 18 months following initial implementation in that country.\nJust how bad was the reaction to the deal? The announcement sent shares spiraling 11 percent in morning trading.\nEric Jackson, managing member for Ironfire Capital, which sold its shares in Yahoo after the company refused to sell itself to Microsoft in the first go-around in 2008, told eWEEK that Yahoo's agreement is a head-scratcher.\n\"I think [Yahoo CEO] Carol Bartz is a really smart leader, and I think she's done a lot of things that three years ago I and others were calling on Yahoo to do, but to walk away from search for this kind of deal. ... They weren't No. 1, but they were still in a pretty good position in that space, so it leaves me scratching my head about why they would do that,\" Jackson said. \"I think probably their board felt pressure to show their shareholders that, 'Hey look, we're doing something to create value for you,' but I don't know if this is the best way to do it.\"\nBut here's the kicker: Jackson was pleased with the deal from Microsoft's standpoint. That's because Jackson and Ironfire have been investors in Microsoft since March of this year, when Microsoft's shares fell to $15 per share.\n\"It's a good deal for Microsoft,\" said Jackson. \"They didn't have to pay anything upfront, and in three years they'll effectively become the No. 2 player in the space, pole-vaulting over Yahoo.\"\nThat has to burn the eyes of any Yahoo executive or board member who reads that. So does this interview on TechFlash, with Bartz and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer laughing like friends who just pulled the wool over the world's eyes.\nDuring the conference call to announce the deal, Bartz was asked specifically why Yahoo elected for no cash upfront. \"Having a big cash payment upfront doesn't help us from an operating standpoint,\" Bartz said. \"What was most important to us was a significant TAC rate so that we could therefore have revenue to support an expense line, so that we could invest in the business.\"\nWorse, Bartz's introductory speech about the deal signaled to analysts and press that Yahoo was acknowledging defeat in the search market to Google, which owns 65 percent of the market to Yahoo's roughly 20 percent.", "Description: Target is an iconic brand, a Fortune 50 company and one of America's leading retailers.At the heart of one of the world's best loved and most recognizable brands is an impeccable Product Development & Design organization.

It is time that the people of the sub-continent work together for a democratic, peaceful, progressive and prosperous region, in an atmosphere free of terror and violence,\u201d PM Modi reportedly told Khan.\nPM Modi\u2019s message to Khan comes in the wake of tensions between India and Pakistan ever since the February 14 Pulwama terror attack on a CRPF convoy. Forty jawans were killed in the attack for which Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility. This was followed by the Balakot airstrikes by the Indian Air Force in which, the government claimed, nearly 300 terrorists were killed on the Pakistani soil. Pakistan retaliated the next day by unsuccessfully attempting to target Indian military installations.\nIndia objected to the invitation extended to several separatist leaders from Jammu and Kashmir for the reception at the Pakistan High Commission. The External Affairs Ministry said no Indian representative will attend similar events in Islamabad as well. However, Pakistani officials said no prominent Hurriyat Conference leader attended the reception.\nIn the past few years, India\u2019s representation at the annual event always remained at the level of a union minister. This year, however, Indian government officials decided to stay away from the reception scheduled on the eve of Pakistan National Day, which is celebrated on March 23. \u201cThe government of India has decided not to send any official representative to the Pakistan National Day event at the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi,\u201d an official was quoted as saying by PTI.", "A Dewsbury teenager has died after allegedly blowing himself up whilst with ISIS in Iraq.\nThe parents of 17-year-old Talha Asmal say they are \u201cutterly devastated\u201d and \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the news and believe Talha was \u201cexploited\u201d and \u201cgroomed\u201d by ISIS recruiters online.\nAn Isis-affiliated social media account reported yesterday evening that a young male named Abu Yusuf al-Britani - believed to be Talha - detonated a vehicle fitted with explosives in the northern Iraqi town of Baiji.\nThe Foreign Office has not yet confirmed whether Talha has died, but his parents have released a statement confirming that photographs shown of a youth purportedly named Abu Yusuf Al Britany appears to show their 17-year-old son.\nIn a statement released this afternoon they say: \u201cTalha comes from a close knit, hardworking, peace loving and law abiding British Muslim family. The entire family unreservedly condemns and abhors all acts of violence wherever perpetrated.\n\u201cTalha himself was a loving, kind, caring and affable teenager. He never harboured any ill will against anybody nor did he ever exhibit any violent, extreme or radical views of any kind.\n\u201cTalha\u2019s tender years and naivety were it seems however exploited by persons unknown who hiding behind the anonymity of the world wide web targeted and befriended Talha and engaged in a process of deliberate and calculated grooming of him.\n\u201cAs a result of this and completely unbeknown to us, his family and entirely against our wishes he ended up travelling it seems to Iraq.\n\u201cWhilst there it appears that Talha fell under the spell of individuals who continued to prey on his innocence and vulnerability to the point where if the press reports are accurate he was ordered to his death by so called ISIS handlers and leaders too cowardly to do their own \u2018dirty\u2019 work.\n\u201cWe are all naturally utterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy that now appears to have befallen us.\n\u201cWe need time and understanding to come to terms with our unimaginable and painful loss.\n\u201cAs a family we would like to take this opportunity to unequivocally state that \u2018ISIS\u2019 are not Islam.

We are all working together to help identify vulnerable members of our society and intervene and engage them before it is too late.\n\u201cIf anyone has concerns that a friend or relative may be vulnerable to radicalisation, expressing extreme views or contemplating travelling to Syria or Iraq, it is vital that we work together to try and prevent that person from travelling.\n\u201cThose who travel to Syria and parts of Iraq are likely to witness extreme violence and could become victims of violence themselves.

He probably hoped to invoke an old-time image of an efficient organization that benefited customers, employees and shareholders.\nBut his actions so far have followed the modern business model of funneling as much money as possible to the top 1%. We now have a new chancellor, president and chief of staff making a great deal more than Carruthers earned. And, soon a nation-wide search will be inaugurated to fill the slot of provost. Will Wheless Partners (the company hired to find Arvizu and then immediately given a consulting contract by Arvizu to determine how to fix NMSU), be retained for the provost search?\nIf NMSU were run like a business, it would have shut down the athletic department for operating at a loss. It would not give bonuses to those executives based on a one-shot performance. A business does not expect members of the public to make substantial contributions to their executives\u2019 salaries. A business would not perennially transfer a million dollars from the academic division to the athletic department.\nFour changes would set NMSU on a path to improvement: raise the entrance requirements, raise the graduation requirements (some NMSU grads downplay the source of their degree lest it jeopardize their job prospects), raise faculty pay with the goal of improving and retaining an excellent faculty and give the voters ... shareholders a large say in selecting the Board of Regents.\nIn a memo to faculty and staff, Arvizu has had to \u201cclarify\u201d his view that the mission of NMSU is job training, Job training is best left to community colleges. It appears Arvizu has had very little university experience. In the private sector he was a technical consultant and his business experience was in government.\nI am informed that there is understandable confusion about enforcement of shelter and shade apart from each other for pets habitually kept outside. A ventilated doghouse is like a dry sauna in the hot sun with a fur-coated animal inside.\nI urge the commission to amend section 7-5 (2) to include shade apart from shelter, as with the previous ordinance.", "Do rising state taxes really cause millionaires to trundle off to more friendly fiscal environs?\nThe study tracks high-income earners from several states, officials and voters of which have created \u201cmillionaire\u201d tax hikes as federal tax rates on those incomes have declined.\nAnalyzing two recent tax hikes from New Jersey and California, the study\u2019s authors found little inclination of wealthy taxpayers to migrate to lower-tax havens in the face of increasing home-state demands.\nThe study was conducted by Charles Varner, a doctoral candidate in sociology at Princeton University, and Cristobal Young, an assistant professor of sociology at Stanford University.\n\u2022Income: $21.6 million for 2010, mostly from investments, and an estimated $20.9 million for 2011.\n\u2022Capital gains taxes: $12.5 million paid in 2010 and an estimated $10.7 million for this year.\n\u2022Charitable donations: $3 million in 2010 and and estimated $4 million in 2011.\nUS Spending +/- $5 TRILLION, US population +/- 360 million ($5T divided by 360M = $13,900 per person). So, if we all split this spending pie equally, every man woman and child would owe almost $14,000/year. Get it?\nSo, Bert\u2026 Mitt paid $10,700,000 one year and $12,500,000 another year. Some think that\u2019s not \u201cfair\u201d enought and he should pay more because he\u2019s \u201cRich\u201d.\nThere are some facts for you Bert. The spending and population are not exact. But they\u2019re close enough for this discussion.\nSo Bert, look on your taxes and tell us how much you paid so we can compare Mitt\u2019s paid taxes with yours. Then the rest of us can decide if what you paid is \u201cfair\u201d enough.\nTaking from the rich does nothing for the economy. It just moves money from one person\u2019s pocket to another. It\u2019s nice campaign rhetoric though.\nAmount of tax is not the issue, percentage of tax is, and I bet I pay a higher percentage than Mitt Romney. As long as his percentage rate is the same there would be no problem, income is income no matter where it came from it should all be taxed at the same rate.\nWhy? Why do you say that?\nThe idea of a tax is to pay your share of public things, government, military, hospitals, schools, police etc. If Romney is paying about 10 million dollars a year, how can anyone in their right mind argue that he\u2019s not paying his share? Obviously, he\u2019s paying 1000 times more than his fair share. And he pays more in one year then you could contribute to this country in 100 lifetimes.\nThink about it. Where do you get off telling someone who\u2019s contributing 10 million dollars a year in taxes to this country that it\u2019s not enough? Don\u2019t you basically have to advocate stealing to justify your position? \u201cHe has it and we want it so let\u2019s steal it from him\u201d.\nWhy should I pay 30% and another person only pay 15%, if we are all in this together, and it is determined that a tax rate of 30% is needed, then anyone who makes the decision to be part of it should pay 30%. Once again some people want to focus on the amount and not the rate. It is great that Mitt has done so well for himself but that doesn\u2019t change the issue that tax rates should be across the board, whether you made 1 million or 1 dollar, it should all be taxed at the same rate.\nEasy answer. Because if you use say $10,000 of services per year you should pull your weight and pay that $10,000. Only if you\u2019re disabled should the rest of us kick in your share.\nEvery able bodied person in this nation should pull their weight. Instead we have 47% not pulling any weight. They are in the cart instead of pulling the cart, making the rest of us pull it with them in it.\nBut I\u2019ll bet you you\u2019re last dollar those 47% have smart phones and internet and cable and most are overweight etc.\nI bet you don\u2019t even realize that you argue against the liberal position. Most conservatives would happily agree to a flat tax. No favoritism. Treat everyone the same.\nAnd even then it\u2019s still anti-capitalistic. When I pay my cable bill, does the cable company get to call me up and say \u201chey, tell us what you earn and then we\u2019ll decide what to charge you for your bill. And guess what, we\u2019ve decided to give 47% of the people cable for free and we\u2019re heavily in debt so if you make a lot of money we\u2019re going to charge you an absurd rate for your cable to make up for out debt\u201d? No, obviously not. In theory at least, income tax should work the same way. Figure out what public services each person should pay for and bill them for those public services. Pull your own weight rather than voting in politicians who will promise to force other people to carry your dead weight.\nIf we get the same service, shouldn\u2019t we pay the same amount of dollars for those services?

Now seriously, do you think the 1m covered the rich guy\u2019s\u2019 fair share of schools, police, sewer, emergency room, military, government etc etc.? Obviously it covers it 100 times over. And the rich guy pays that every year. He pays more of his fair share in one year than I\u2019ll pay in my entire life.\nSo the argument that the rich don\u2019t pay their fair share is just absurd.

Rodenberg in an order to \"apprehend and detain.\"\n\"His best interests require it,\" Rodenberg wrote.\nThe judge had scheduled the hearing to review an X-ray ordered by the court to assess whether Daniel's Hodgkin's lymphoma was worsening.\nThe boy's father, Anthony Hauser, did appear at Tuesday's hearing, where he testified that he last saw the mother, Colleen Hauser, at the family's farm on Monday night, when she told him she was going to leave \"for a time.\"\nHe said he did not know where they had gone.\nDuring the hearing, Dr. James Joyce testified he saw the boy and his mother on Monday at his office. He said the boy had \"an enlarged lymph node\" near his right clavicle and that the X-ray showed \"significant worsening\" of a mass in his chest.\nIn addition, the boy complained of \"extreme pain\" at the site where a port had been inserted to deliver an initial round of chemotherapy. The pain was \"most likely caused by the tumor or mass pressing on the port,\" testified Joyce, who called the X-ray \"fairly dramatic\" evidence that the cancer was worsening.\nRodenberg ordered custody of the boy transferred to Brown County Family Services and issued a contempt order for the mother.\nA call to the family's home in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, was not immediately returned.\nPhilip Elbert, Daniel's court-appointed attorney, said he considers his client to have a \"diminished capacity\" for reasons of his age and the illness and that he believes Daniel should be treated by a cancer specialist.\nElbert added that he does not believe Daniel -- who, according to court papers, cannot read -- has enough information to make an informed decision regarding his treatment.\nDaniel's symptoms of persistent cough, fatigue and swollen lymph nodes were diagnosed in January as Hodgkins lymphoma. In February, the cancer responded well to an initial round of chemotherapy, but the treatment's side effects concerned the boy's parents, who then opted not to pursue further chemo and instead sought other medical opinions.\nCourt documents show that the doctors estimated the boy's chance of 5-year remission with more chemotherapy and possibly radiation at 80 percent to 95 percent.\nBut the family opted for a holistic medical treatment based upon Native American healing practices called Nemenhah and rejected further treatment.\nIn a written statement issued last week, an attorney for the parents said they \"believe that the injection of chemotherapy into Danny Hauser amounts to an assault upon his body, and torture when it occurs over a long period of time.\"\nMedical ethicists say parents generally have a legal right to make decisions for their children, but there is a limit.\n\"You have a right, but not an open-ended right,\" Arthur Caplan, director of the center for bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, said last week. \"You can't compromise the life of your child.\"", "Could Giants\u2019 Ishikawa be the odd man out?\nCould the player who hit the pennant-clinching home run in 2014 be designated for assignment and taken off the 40-man roster before he plays a single game with the Giants this year?\n\u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t thought about it,\u201d Travis Ishikawa said Tuesday.\nThe Giants are facing a roster squeeze.

It sent a message to Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's caretaker Prime Minister, saying that while Jews have a right to live anywhere in Israel, the way in which settlers moved into a building in the Christian Quarter earlier this month was insensitive and provocative.\nThe group warned Mr. Shamir that American Jews could not support Israel's move to back the settlers and that the issue was having a serious effect on the relationship between the two countries.\nLeaders of Jewish organizations here are concerned that the Shamir Government's support for Jews settling in the Christian Quarter could erode support for Israel from non-Jews in the United States. Muslims and Christians in Jerusalem view any move by Jewish settlers into their quarters as the first step toward diminishing their presence and influence there.\nThe lobbying organization, which is known by the acronym Aipac, declined to discuss its message to Mr. Shamir. The contents were described by officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nThe message was one of several unusually emphatic gestures today by leading American Jewish groups. The organizations called on Mr. Shamir to repudiate the $1.8 million covertly provided by his Government to Jewish settlers to lease the complex of four buildings known as St. John's Hospice. The building is near the Tomb of the Holy Sepulcher, considered by Christians to be the site of the tomb of Jesus.\nLeaders of American Jewish groups said that Israel's backing created the impression that the Israeli Government cannot be trusted when it says that it does not use American money to support settlement activities. Israel's role in the settlement could deter American Jews from donating money to Israel for fear that it would end up in the hands of religious extremists, the leaders warned, and could tarnish Israel's record in promoting religious tolerance in Jerusalem.\nAbraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said, ''The time now is for the Israeli Government to repudiate this incident, to fire those responsible and to make a clear statement by the Prime Minister indicating that this was not and is not Government policy.\n''I think nothing short of that will restore credibility to the Israeli Government when it is essential for its dealings with friends and allies,'' he said.\n''Jews will give sacrificially to settle Soviet Jews in Israel, but they will not do so if these funds are to be diverted surreptitiously for the provacative settlement of religious zealots,'' he said.\nMiss Tutwiler also criticized Israel for its difficulty in reaching a decision on entering American-sponsored talks with Palestinians even as it made decisions about financing new settlements.\nIn addition to the $3 billion that Israel receives annually in military and economic assistance, the Shamir Government has asked the United States for $400 million in housing loan guarantees to help resettle Soviet immigrants. The request is before Congress.\nAs a result of the erosion in trust between the Bush Administration and Mr. Shamir's Government, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d testified before Congress last month that the Administration would insist on guarantees from Israel that a loan guarantee would not be spent on housing in the occupied territories, which would violate United States law.\nNormally Israel provides the United States with a pro forma declaration that aid was spent on housing projects within Israeli's pre-1967 boundaries.

It's also an opportunity for couples to showcase foods that let their personalities shine through.\"\nIn fact, 25 percent of couples are choosing hors d'oeuvres for their wedding receptions this year. Other popular catering options include barbecue (25 percent), Mexican/Latin (19 percent), Mediterranean (14 percent), casual American (12 percent) and French (10 percent).\nIn addition to traditional reception fare, the report notes that \"couples are increasingly looking to connect the cuisine offered at their wedding with their own heritage and family traditions, with many couples requesting that caterers recreate special family recipes.\"\nAs for wedding cakes, the report states that 80 percent of couples want traditional layered cakes and that they will be taller than ever this year with 57 percent of couples requesting three-layer cakes. Similarly, 21 percent of couples are choosing cakes with two layers and 15 percent with four layers. Cupcakes have also seen a spike in popularity with a 10 percent increase from last year.", "\u201cThere is less focus today on physical locations because you can do things virtually,\u201d Iles acknowledged. \u201cBut for any software focused business operating in the enterprise, and especially if you\u2019re an ISV, you typically have a fairly heavy service arm.\nWhile a channel often provides the quickest and most effective route to market, challenges remain for businesses attempting to build ecosystems from scratch, in a country unfamiliar with its offerings and value proposition.\n\u201cBuilding out a channel is a tricky strategy to set up,\u201d Iles cautioned. \u201cEveryone dreams of activating channels in each of the separate markets they enter but it\u2019s much harder than you think and typically, it isn\u2019t the best strategy to pursue.\n\u201cYou can of course get lucky if there\u2019s something unique in your proposition but the challenge is that you\u2019ll typically be a very small component of a channel partner\u2019s revenue. Therefore you get the mind- set your market share gets.\nAfter running initial rounds of analysis in relation to the local market \u2014 assessing customer buying patterns and competitive plays \u2014 Iles and his team began to build out a viable entry strategy across the Pacific.\nHaving identified a target market in the US, Centaman was then faced with a common dilemma for businesses harbouring global aspirations \u2014 hire local or bring your own.\n\u201cWe made the decision to invest and put our own team on the ground and we set up the business as a full-blown subsidiary,\u201d Iles explained. \u201cYou reach the point where you either send your right-hand person or bring someone else in.\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re going to do something, the best approach is to go and set it up yourself \u2014 it\u2019s the most effective but resource intensive strategy.\nBecause for Iles, hiring somebody blind that doesn\u2019t understand your company or your values in a new country represents a risky strategy for aspiring software providers.\nOn the flip side however, local knowledge is key to unlocking the purse strings of local customers.\n\u201cTypically you\u2019ll know your marketplace but the perfect set up is that you hire a vice president or country manager that is one of your people and a trusted person you\u2019ve sent over,\u201d Iles said.\n\u201cAnd then they can hire a local sales manager that understands the market and the key players within it. That might be through a competitive poach but once you do, then you\u2019ve got the right combination of skills.\nAnother expansion approach, according to Iles, is the notion of the joint venture, setting up shop with an in-country provider to help build the foundations for a sustained local push.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t think about joining forces with another partner but we pursued a joint venture in New Zealand,\u201d Iles said. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting a bit more skin in the game and it doesn\u2019t cost you as much as a full- blown subsidiary you\u2019re setting up.\n\u201cWe found a partner that we thought could help us add significant footprint so we set up a company that we owned 50-50. So if the whole company did well, we all did well.\nWhether it be established providers or fledging start-ups, Iles believes opportunities are arising for partners to leverage local vendor alliances, in a bid to tap into global footprints.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a role for vendors to step up,\u201d Iles added. \u201cPartners are keen for key cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google to help them expand.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the direction the market is taking but it\u2019s a little nascent at the minute. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s working particularly well at this stage but it\u2019s clear that\u2019s where the market is heading.\nIn comparing today\u2019s business climate with that of 5-10 years ago, Iles acknowledged that going global from day one is \u201ca lot easier than it once was\u201d, especially within the context of localisation and customisation.\n\u201cIt depends on the size of the software you have, particularly when you have cloud orientated solutions,\u201d Iles said. \u201cWith AWS, Microsoft and Google, if you take a solution you\u2019ve built on the cloud, you can literally replicate your infrastructure on a global basis.\n\u201cTherefore, all you\u2019re really worrying about is actually tracking customers and a bit of consulting services on top.", "FIFA has banned the head of Palestinian soccer from attending matches for a year for inciting hatred and violence toward Lionel Messi as part of a campaign to stop Argentina's national team playing in Israel.\nRajoub \"incited hatred and violence\" by calling on \"football fans to target the Argentinian Football Association and burn jerseys and pictures of Lionel Messi,\" soccer's governing body said.\nJustifying canceling the game, Argentina Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie said the players felt \"totally attacked, violated\" after images emerged of the team's white and sky-blue striped jerseys stained with red paint that resembled blood following Rajoub's comments.\nFIFA imposed the minimum ban allowed in its disciplinary code for inciting hatred or violence. It prevents Rajoub from attending matches or engaging with the media at or near stadiums on matchdays for a year from Friday.\nRajoub, who is also head of the Palestinian Olympic Committee, was fined 20,000 Swiss francs ($20,300).\nThe Palestinian Football Association said FIFA \"rushed to condemn\" Rajoub based on \"non-neutral media reports.\" He was filmed in June, saying in Arabic \"we will target Messi and we will ask everyone to burn his t-shirt, his picture and to abandon him.\"\nRajoub was not granted a hearing and his testimony was not considered by the disciplinary committee, the PFA said. The ban will apply for the 2019 Asian Cup in United Arab Emirates, which kicks off in January, and likely include the start of the 2022 World Cup qualifying program.\nBut Rajoub is able to continue running the federation and attend FIFA meetings. He has been a constant thorn in the side of soccer's governing body as he tries to get sanctions imposed on Israel.\nAt the annual FIFA Congress, Rajoub regularly addresses soccer nations to demand Israel be punished for restricting movement of Palestinian players, and for forming teams in West Bank settlements.\nIsrael has rejected the Palestinian campaign as an attempt to politicize sports and has cited security concerns as the reason behind the occasional restrictions placed on Palestinian players, particularly in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.\nRajoub repeatedly used \"threats and incitement\" to advance a political agenda, said Gilad Erdan, Israel's minister for strategic affairs and public security.\n\"International sports should be about bringing people together, not driving them apart,\" Erdan said. \"I call on the International Olympic Committee to suspend Rajoub as well.\"\nIsrael's plan to stage the Argentina game in Jerusalem also incensed Rajoub because the stadium that was to host the match is situated in a neighborhood built on the site of a former Palestinian village destroyed during the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948.\nPalestinians claim the eastern sector of Jerusalem as their capital.

He's bringing the private foundation into the 21st century and back to the community.\nAfter the death of T. Wayne Miller, the long-time president and chairman of the The John E. and Aliese Price Foundation, a new leader stepped in to take the reins of the organization.\nNow Kenneth Walker has started turning the show horse into a work horse.\nInstead of handing out favors to pet projects around the country, the grant-making $8.6 million private foundation is focused on granting money to Lee County nonprofit organizations, fulfilling a mission to serve the local community. The standards for making grants have tightened and the application process has been made more stringent requiring documentation of a valid charitable status and a current budget submitted with the application.\nThe foundation had been been the subject of a January 2016 investigation by The News-Press revealing $8,000 payments to board members for attending one or two meetings, conflicts of interests, personal use of foundation assets, foundation-sponsored scholarships, loans and gifts funneled through an affiliated nonprofit organization and grants made to charities and educational institutions outside of the area and even outside of Florida.\nThe foundation was established in 1965, by philanthropists John and Aliese Price. Price died in 1985. His son, Jack Price, became chairman and when he died in 2007, Miller served as president and chairman until his death in 2016.\nBy the time Miller died, the assets of the foundation had begun to diminish, dropping from $19.3 million in 2000 to less than $9 million. Meanwhile the foundation continued to make grants, invest in private business and property and maintain its 2,200-foot headquarters where one full-time employee worked.\nAfter Walker became CEO, the foundation sold the properties, including the headquarters. It cut ties with the Baptist Foundation, which was almost entirely funded by the Price Foundation and handed out loans, scholarships and grants often at the Miller's behest. The Price Foundation began renting office space, cut expenses and saw assets increase by $2 million due to the property sales and market gains.\nRussell Priddy, who has been on the board of directors for 20 years and is married to the granddaughter of the founders, is optimistic about the changes he has seen under Walker's leadership.\n\"The foundation has made very appropriate changes and is headed in a much more positive direction,\" Priddy said. \"We are able to put more money into the community and Ken (Walker) has certainly worked hard to help achieve that goal.\"\nThe foundation launched a website, ThePriceFoundation.com, with links for the application process and for its Form 990, a the annual financial report nonprofit organizations file with the IRS.\n\"We want to be transparent,\" Walker said. His goal is for the Price Foundation to be a partner with nonprofit organizations in the local community. It has made matching fund awards to the Southwest Florida Community Foundation for an innovation hub, to Florida Arts, Inc. for renovations to the Sydney & Berne Davis Art Center and to The Alliance for the Arts in Fort Myers to help it qualify for funds from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation.\nSince Walker took over as CEO, the foundation has made $460,000 in grants to nonprofits to 27 organizations. In prior years the foundation dispensed an average of average $225,000 split among 35 nonprofits.\n\"When a new person comes into an organization that's been been around a long time it's just natural your going to look at it and say, 'Okay, it's served a good purpose for a lot of years but it's time to modernize,' \" Walker said. \"So basically, that's what I did.... It's a new era and a new time... Let's take a look at the new community we have today and how can we be involved in helping to make it better.\"\nFor Sarah Owen, president and CEO of the Southwest Florida Community Foundation, it has been \"encouraging and inspiring\" to see the foundation's new direction. The Price Foundation, she said, is showing \"dedication to making an impact on local organizations and making a commitment to nonprofits and those that they serve.\"", "Here\u2019s President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s explanation-slash-spin for the dearth of celebrities so far slated for his inauguration: he doesn\u2019t want them there.

That\u2019s changed with Dark Souls: Remastered, and it\u2019s been a fascinating experience.\nI played a few hours of Demon\u2019s Souls in 2009 after seeing a bunch of smart people raving about it online, but couldn\u2019t get my head around it. It seemed too janky, too awkward, and too difficult.\nWhen Dark Souls came out in 2011, I was still intimidated by these kinds of games, and didn\u2019t even try it. I had just started writing for Kotaku, and remember my then-colleague Michael McWhertor chiding the rest of the staff for giving our Game of the Year award to Skyrim instead of Dark Souls all while wondering if, based on his review of the game and the fact that so few of us had played it, he maybe had a point.\nBy the time Dark Souls 2 hit in 2014, I was ready to give another Souls game a shot. I played a significant amount of that game, maybe 10 or so hours. It was enough to defeat The Pursuer (easily the toughest Souls boss I\u2019d ever defeated), unlock a bunch of areas, and get my head around the combat. I remember being bummed out by how many people disliked the game and feeling like I\u2019d missed the boat on this series. I eventually lost interest and stopped playing.\nEven just looking at a screenshot of Bloodborne makes me want to go play it all the way through again.\nIn 2015, Bloodborne changed everything for me. This was it: the FromSoftware game I\u2019d been waiting for. I devoured it, and still think of it regularly. It remains one of my favorite video games. I wrote a ton about it for Kotaku, and even wrote our mega-tips-post for the game. I was a convert.\nAfter Bloodborne, I attempted to go back and play the original Dark Souls, but it was never quite the right time. It was so much slower than Bloodborne, and so much more complicated. My longest attempt got me past the Taurus Demon and then I kind of lost interest. Part of the problem was that I had modded the PC version to get it running at 60fps but there were enough lingering bugs (for example, I couldn\u2019t quit the game normally without getting stuck at a black screen) that I never quite felt like diving in.\nDark Souls 3 came out just a year after Bloodborne, and once again I was fully sucked in. I sank a good 80 hours into that game, even as I saw the complaints that the series still hadn\u2019t quite recaptured the first game\u2019s glory. I played some of the DLC as well, though I didn\u2019t finish everything.\nI obsessively played Team Ninja\u2019s Nioh when it came out in 2017. Ugh, that game is so good. While not a FromSoftware game, it was yet another Souls-ish game that I allowed to utterly consume me.\nIt\u2019s 2018, and Dark Souls Remastered is out. Turns out this is what I was waiting for\u2014a largely unaltered version of Dark Souls redone for modern systems, with a bunch of new players on the servers.\nOkay so I\u2019m using a spear, whatever, shut up, it\u2019s only until I find a katana.\nThe experience of really buckling down and playing Dark Souls after sinking so many hours into its sequels and successors is, I would imagine, a little like going back to the first Captain America and Thor movies after first watching Avengers: Infinity War. Narratively, I\u2019m seeing characters at the beginning that I\u2019ve already met at the middle and the end. I\u2019ve run into recurring characters like Solare of Astora and the jolly Onion Knight, Siegmeyer of Catarina, for the first time, despite the fact that I already know them from the sequels and years of memes. I\u2019m also learning firsthand about the various mechanical refinements and changes From has made over the years, not all of which have necessarily improved the series\u2019 formula.\nDark Souls\u2019 intricate level design is easily its most striking aspect, at least for someone accustomed to the less tightly-wound regions of Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls\u2019 kingdom of Lordran is dense and actually pretty small, a collection of stacked regions built like an intricate Lego construction.\nNow that I\u2019ve played more of the game, the illustration is even cooler.\nEqually significant is the lack of a fast-travel option, mostly because of how it impacts the level design. I knew that Dark Souls 2\u2019s addition of fast-travel had been controversial\u2014really a reversion to a norm established in Demon\u2019s Souls, which also had fast-travel\u2014though it took seeing Dark Souls in action to understand why. Both Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 allowed you to fast-travel from save points, which as I played those games struck me as a pleasant convenience. But playing Dark Souls underlines just how fundamentally a lack of fast-travel can change one of these games.\nAfter making my way through the Undead Burg, defeating the Taurus Demon and surviving a dash across the Wyvern-guarded bridge, I found myself safe by a bonfire in the Undead Parish. (I did not discover the kick-down ladder back to the Undead Burg until much later. What can I say, it\u2019s easy to miss.) I made my way past a big armored boar, fought a bunch of smaller undead dudes, did some dying, and finally started to feel like I was getting a handle on the new area. But I was also feeling unmoored in a way that I\u2019ve never quite felt in a Souls game, because there was no easy way for me to get back to where I\u2019d started.\nIn Bloodborne as in Dark Souls 2 and 3, it\u2019s a cinch to return to your home base at any point to rest, recharge, and upgrade your gear. This was also true in Demon\u2019s Souls, meaning the feature\u2019s removal in Dark Souls was an experiment that was never repeated. Dark Souls\u2019 Firelink Shrine feels like a similar safe zone to those other games, but there\u2019s no way to quickly teleport there.\nThat had a noticeable effect on my mindset during that first excursion into the Undead Parish. The farther I got, the more I felt like I was out on my own. I crept through the cathedral at the top of the Parish and found what looked like an elevator built into the confessional. What followed was something I\u2019ve never quite experienced in a Souls game.\nI climbed on the elevator, unsure where it would take me.\nDown I plunged, until I saw a familiar aqua green hue through the window.\nCould it be\u2026 it was!\nI had just unlocked a shortcut all the way back down to Firelink Shrine. I had been expecting that kind of thing from this game, but it was an eye-opening experience just the same. So this is how this game works, I thought. Without fast-travel, every point in Lordran must be connected to every other point by a series of shortcuts. In order to quickly get around, I\u2019ll have to mentally chart the entire game, with no shortcuts or fast-travel options to break things up.\nBloodborne pulls a similar trick with a massive ladder up from the depths of the Forbidden Woods connecting back to the starting area of Central Yharnam. But that shortcut felt substantially different because of Bloodborne\u2019s fast-travel. I could have warped to Central Yharnam any time I pleased, thanks to Bloodborne\u2019s workshop hub and lantern warping. It was neat to see how the woods connected to the city, but it was an academic sort of neatness, not a functional one.\nI understand how Bloodborne\u2019s structure benefits from a more diffuse arrangement of levels\u2014some of the regions are set amid dreamscapes and on alternate planes of reality, after all. But Dark Souls\u2019 approach makes for a more extreme distillation of the thing I love most about these games\u2014mastering levels by exploring every nook and cranny. I can already understand why people lamented the re-addition of fast-travel in later games.\nIn her review of the remastered edition, my Dark Souls-expert colleague Heather Alexandra mentions that the game loses track of its puzzle-box exploration at the extreme ends of Lordran, which makes me a little skeptical that I\u2019ll actually finish the game. I\u2019m psyched to at least reach those far ends, though.\nNavigation is the most immediately noticeable difference between Dark Souls and its successors, but I\u2019ve noticed plenty of other changes, as well. There\u2019s the overall slowness compared with later games, with roll-dodges enabled only along a four-way axis instead of the eight-way diagonal-axes of later games. Enemies are slower too, and less aggressive than I\u2019ve gotten used to in Bloodborne or even Dark Souls 3. There\u2019s the fact that backstabbing is notoriously easier in Dark Souls, which I\u2019ve been happy to exploit by hugging and circling low-level enemies when we fight. There\u2019s the overall graphical simplicity compared with later games, which makes areas easier to \u201cread\u201d at a glance, if occasionally a little drab.\nThere\u2019s also the fact that this game already has years\u2019 worth of accumulated knowledge built up around it. That made it easy to watch guides leading to the best starting weapons and armor, an indulgence I aborted when I realized how quickly it was undermining the process of joyful discovery that makes me love these games. I did a well-known suicide run into the Valley of the Drakes to grab the Dragon Shield and Astora\u2019s Straight Sword, and immediately regretted it. Better to discover things on my own.\nIf and when Sony releases a remastered Demon\u2019s Souls for PS4, I imagine I\u2019ll have a similarly eye-opening experience diving into that. Heck, the same would probably go for a return to From\u2019s much older King\u2019s Field games, though I gather those don\u2019t hold up nearly as well.\nIt\u2019s common to only get into a video game series on its second or third iteration. The developers working on a franchise have many years to work out kinks and refine their approach, to the point that sometimes, the early games just don\u2019t hold up. I\u2019m happy to say that Dark Souls holds up, and helps me better appreciate the subsequent Souls games I\u2019ve already played and mastered. After spending years falling in love with what this series has become, my return to Dark Souls has helped me better appreciate where so much of it began. It\u2019s been an unusual sort of homecoming, but a welcome one.", "On Thursday in Detroit, General Motors unveiled the new 2019 GMC Sierra, a truck whose craziest feature by far is the \u201cMultiPro\u201d tailgate that can be set into six different configurations. Here\u2019s exactly how it works.\nThose latches will open, and the tailgate will drop slowly. Like many tailgates on modern trucks, it is damped.\nDoing so will pull in two latches (see the red arrow the picture below\u2014note that the inner tailgate is down in the image below as well) on either side of the load stop. With the latches pulled, the black striker (pointed out with a blue arrow) bolted to the sides of the inner tailgate will will release the load stop.\nThis allows you to put your oversized sheets of wood and pipes and other long things in your bed without worrying about them flying out of the back and impaling someone.\nNotice how there is no locking mechanism keeping the load stop firmly in its upward position (it does remain there without assistance, though\u2014at least when the truck isn\u2019t moving). That, according to Patterson, is so that when people are using that for a step (which I\u2019ll show next), they won\u2019t have to unlock the load stop every time they want to close their tailgate.\nFrom that position, if you want a step to help you get into your bed, you\u2019ve got to guess at where the top of the two aforementioned buttons is by putting your finger under the tailgate and feeling for some rubber round buttons.\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be any visual indicator on the bed to help guide you, but don\u2019t give up. The buttons are down there.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that you don\u2019t have to lift the load stop/step before clicking that inner tailgate button you fumbled around for\u2014it\u2019s easy enough to just open the tailgate, find the button and open the inner tailgate, and then fold down the step.\nI hopped on the step, and found no real reason to need a handle to get up onto the bed, but perhaps if I had a load in my hand, or if I weren\u2019t as healthy as I am, the handle\u2014fastened to the driver\u2019s side inner bedside\u2014would have helped.\nThe trigger pointed out in blue in the image before the last releases the handle from its locked position so it can be stored again in its C-shaped, plastic holder.\nIt\u2019s an extremely simple handle design\u2014much more so than the intricate, three-position, in-tailgate setup described in one of GM\u2019s patent applications that we looked at a few months back (shown above).\nAlso worth mentioning are the lights built into the inner tailgate, as shown above, which can help you place your foot onto that step, which has grip tape on it, and is rated to hold up to 375 pounds of static load.\nWhen you\u2019re done with that step, pushing it back into its stowed position (or not ever folding it down in the first place) yields about eight or nine inches of additional reach into the bed.\nI found that closing the primary tailgate from this position is a bit awkward, as the inner tailgate doesn\u2019t close first. Both the inner and primary tailgate close simultaneously, which is a bit strange to get used to. Though it is worth mentioning that it is possible to push down on the primary tailgate to prevent it from lifting so that you can close inner tailgate first, and then shut both of them together.\nNow that we\u2019ve looked at four of the truck\u2019s configurations (regular tailgate-down; tailgate down with load stop; tailgate and inner tailgate down for added reach; tailgate, inner tailgate and step down), let\u2019s look at the final two, which apply when pushing the top button with the main tailgate in the closed position.\nThat will actuate the two inner electric latches (one is shown above), and\u2014with a little tug rearwards\u2014the inner tailgate will rotate about its hinges, and slowly drop.\nThe right one, however, contains only a wire harness (you can see the Christmas tree fastener holding the wire in the picture below), which is needed for the step lights, the buttons, the rear light and the rearview camera.\nPull on the ledge just above the button, and the result will be another load stop, but at a higher level than if the tailgate were down.\nIn other words, if you throw some 2x6s across your bed, you can store a bunch of stuff under that \u201cfalse floor,\u201d and you can toss stuff on top, including long things, as the load stop will keep them from flying out of the back.\nOne thing worth mentioning about the buttons: you cannot open the primary tailgate if the inner tailgate is open, as there\u2019s an \u201cajar switch\u201d that will prevent it. This, Patterson told me, is a safety measure.\nSo what this means is that if you want to quickly use your bed\u2019s step (i.e. you don\u2019t want to have to fold the primary tailgate and then search for the button underneath), you have to do as is shown in the .gif at the top of this article: press the bottom button and then quickly thereafter, press the top one. This will lower both the primary and inner tailgate simultaneously, and all you\u2019ll have to do is fold down the step.", "Six years ago, I responded to a request from an Irish newspaper. They were looking for stories from women who\u2019d had to travel for an abortion due to Ireland\u2019s draconian laws. Anonymity was guaranteed. I happen to be one of the 12 Irish women a day who have abortions (roughly nine travel abroad either for abortion care, and three or so more take illegally obtained pills). After emergency contraception failed in 2006, I found myself having to fly to Utrecht in the Netherlands for a termination. So I had a story to tell. I went to meet the journalist and begged her never to reveal my identity. I was sure that if people heard me mention the A-word, let alone that I\u2019d had one, they would never laugh at me again. Most of my work is in comedy. Abortion isn\u2019t the first thing on the list when it comes to laughs. So how did I come to be standing on a stage in Dublin Castle on Saturday evening, celebrating the referendum result with politicians from almost all parties, alongside women who\u2019d made the sad and lonely journey overseas for healthcare?\nThere\u2019s a bit of a story in that, too. In 2015, Ireland had just become the first country in the world to bring in equal marriage via popular vote. The whole country was glowing with newfound equality, even though it had come at a price: LGBTQ+ people had had to smile on the doorsteps asking voters to grant them their rights, even if the answer was no or that someone might consider it. I was so proud of them. They were so brave. And it made me feel even more cowardly for not breaking the silence on my own truth. I felt angry, too, that I was colluding in someone else\u2019s lie. Why was I staying silent to assuage the moral discomfort of strangers? We all knew we knew someone who \u201cwent to England\u201d, who had \u201ctravelled\u201d (these have been our euphemisms for abortion).\nBut we didn\u2019t really know. We didn\u2019t see their faces. There were people who talked about having had abortions: the writer Mary Holland stood up long ago but nobody stood with her. In 2015, a month after the marriage-equality referendum, there were about eight of us gathered around a table, drinking and chatting about what had to be next. It had to be repealing the 8th amendment: the constitutional clause that gave equal rights to a foetus and the person carrying it. All of us at the table had been vocally pro-choice (in itself a bit risky back in the day). We\u2019d taken to the streets in anger when Savita Halappanavar needlessly died, marched at the Abortion Rights Campaign\u2019s March for Choice, but never shared our own experiences. You just didn\u2019t do that here.\nAnd so I told my story in a tent in rural County Laois while basslines boomed from nearby stages. People in the tent stood up and spoke of their own journeys. They cried. I cried. I\u2019ve barely stopped since. That same week, R\u00f3is\u00edn\u2019s story was published. We got abuse, both vicious and vocal. We were told we were \u201ctoo much\u201d, that we were scaring people. But we knew that wasn\u2019t true. We knew that, if we all just kept talking to each other, people would find out. That the woman sitting next to you on the bus is \u201cthat woman\u201d. That the woman on the telly is. Your daughter is. You could be. I am that woman. Conversations have been had all across the country. Tears shed. Hands held. And those conversations shattered secrets and shame and gave faces to a hidden issue.\nAnd the ending to the story is that on Saturday, Ireland set us free.", "A big problem with the WNBA is that for many of the best players, it makes financial sense to not play in the league. Players make so much less money stateside than they do by participating in international leagues during the winter that the overseas leagues have started offering compensation to stars to sit out their WNBA season in order to save their strength. In 2015, Diana Taurasi became the first player to cash in on one of those offers when her Russian Premier League team offered her over $1.5 million to play for them\u2014and not for the Phoenix Mercury, where she was making the league maximum at $107,000.\nEven if you\u2019re not getting compensated to rest your legs, foreign leagues provide the women in the WNBA, where the average salary is $75,000, a chance to make many times what they do back home. The league doesn\u2019t discourage this and, in fact, recently debuted a security app to help players abroad better communicate with the WNBA\u2019s security team. But for the roughly two dozen WBNA players playing in the 14-team Turkish league this offseason, the recent violence in country has many of them considering coming home early.\nA group of players from the Los Angeles Sparks were out on New Year\u2019s Eve, right next door to the nightclub in Istanbul where a terrorist attacked killed 39 people, inspiring a \u201chandful\u201d of players (who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of contract and safety concerns) to tell the AP that they are looking to return home as quickly as possible.\nEven if they can get out of their contracts\u2014certain language should allow at least some players to opt out if the U.S. government recommends that a certain country is unsafe\u2014it\u2019s not necessarily so simple.", "Pharmacy technicians, often called pharm techs, perform a lot of different jobs in a pharmacy, whether they're working at your neighborhood store or in a hospital. Part of their job involves measuring the dosage of a prescription, especially when converting from one measurement system to another. A working knowledge of basic math, including basic algebra, is needed to perform these calculations. Now, if the word \"algebra\" makes you scream while you recall standing at the chalkboard in high school working on a complex equation in full view of the entire class, relax. There are books and tables to refer to in making these calculations, as well as your notes. The calculations you'll use on the job are not that complex. And the more you use math, the better you'll become, until it's as easy as writing your name.\nAs a pharmacy tech, you'll collect from patients and health providers all the necessary information for you to fill a prescription. You'll answer patient phone calls, call physician offices for prescription refills, keep track of the pharmacy's inventory of medications and supplies, and you'll let the pharmacist know when supplies are low.\nYou'll also measure the amount of medication needed to fill a prescription. This is where the math comes in. Prescriptions aren't written for your convenience in filling them; they're written as directions to patients on how often and how much to take and when. So, if a prescription says, \"Take 1 teaspoon by mouth, two times daily for 10 days,\" but the medicine is measured in milliliters (ml), you need to convert teaspoons (tsp) to ml.\nLooking at your handy conversion table, you see that 1 tsp = 5 ml. The patient needs to take that twice a day for 10 days. So, your calculation would be 5 ml x 2 x 10 = 100 ml. That's how much medication you need to put in the bottle for that prescription to last for 10 days. You can use the tables, notes and anything else that helps you, for as long as you need to, but you'll find that you will quickly memorize the prescriptions you use most often.\nComplete a certificate program at a technical school, lasting one year or less.\nEarn a two-year associate degree from a community college.\nLearn on the job from a registered pharmacist and senior pharmacy techs.\nIn the past, many pharm techs had learned the skills of the job from on-the-job training, but these days most employers prefer to hire technicians who have some education in the field. There is still much to learn in actual practice on the job.\nCertificate programs and associate degrees come with pros and cons.. In a technical school's certificate program, your education will be focused on courses you'll need for the job, such as math used as a pharm tech; learning the various ways for dispensing medications; learning pharmaceutical ethics and laws; learning the names of medications and what they're used for, as well as their typical dosages; and the method of practical record keeping for the job. The advantage is that in one year or less you can be working and getting paid.\nSince an associate degree takes two years to earn, you have the opportunity for additional well-rounded and in-depth study. Additional courses could include anatomy and physiology, more pharmacy math or basic accounting, as well as communications courses that help when working with customers. Although it will take longer to earn the associate degree, it may give you an edge in getting a job, and it puts you halfway toward earning a bachelor's degree, if you decide to continue your education as a pharmacist or in another field.\nIn May 2017, the median annual wage for pharmacy technicians was $31,750. A median is the midpoint in a list of salaries, where half earn more and half earn less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $22,000, while the highest 10 percent earned over $46,980. Median salaries were higher in hospitals, $36,710, than in pharmacies and drug stores, $29,500. As an hourly rate, assuming a 40-hour work week and two weeks' vacation per year, hourly wages ranged from $11 an hour to $23 an hour or more.\nLicensing requirements for pharmacy technicians vary by state, so check with your State Board of Pharmacy to learn your requirements. Becoming a certified pharm tech, which requires passing an exam given by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board or the Institute for the Certification of Pharmacy Technicians, also helps you become a favored job candidate. Although you can become certified after working for awhile, some employers prefer to hire those who are already certified.\nMore than half of pharmacy technicians, 52 percent, worked in pharmacies or drug stores in May 2017. The second-largest group, 16 percent, worked in hospitals. The remaining pharm techs worked in food or general merchandise stores. Most work full-time, with schedules that include nights and weekends. Although the work is indoors, it does require standing most of the time.\nThis is clearly a career where experience counts. Once you have some experience, not only are you a more favored candidate for a job but salaries are higher because of the additional experience and knowledge you bring to the job. You don't need additional training just an explanation of how each employer may operate a little differently from another. You'll be able to contribute to the job and be productive immediately. Additional skills, such as experience in filling IV and chemotherapy prescriptions as well as supervising less experienced pharmacy technicians, may also make you a more valued employee.\nWith the population growing older, they have greater need for medication to fight the diseases of aging, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Therefore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects the need for pharmacy technicians to grow 12 percent between 2016 and 2026. That's a faster rate of growth than average.\nEpharmacy Technicians: I'm Not Good at Math -- Will the Pharmacy Technician Career Suit Me?\nBean-Mellinger, Barbara. \"Math You Need to Know to Be a Pharmacy Technician.\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/math-need-pharmacy-technician-17220.html. 29 June 2018.", "American workers have been receiving meager pay increases for so long now that it\u2019s reasonable to talk in sweeping terms about the trend. It is the great wage slowdown of the 21st century.\nThe typical American family makes less than the typical family did 15 years ago, a statement that hadn\u2019t previously been true since the Great Depression. Even as the unemployment rate has fallen in the last few years, wage growth has remained mediocre. Last week\u2019s jobs report offered the latest evidence: The jobless rate fell below 6 percent, yet hourly pay has risen just 2 percent over the last year, not much faster than inflation. The combination has puzzled economists and frustrated workers.\nOf course, there is a long history of pessimistic predictions about dark new economic eras, and those predictions are generally wrong. But things have been disappointing for long enough now that we should take the pessimistic case seriously. In some fundamental way, the economy seems broken.\nI probably don\u2019t need to persuade most readers of this view, so the better way to think about the issue may be to consider the optimistic case. And last week, in his most substantive speech on domestic policy in months, President Obama laid out that case.\nIt included the usual set of glass-half-full statistics and wishful-thinking proposals that officeholders talk about during political campaigns. More notable, though, was that Mr. Obama \u2013 speaking at Northwestern University \u2013 explained why he thought wage growth was likely to pick up.\nHe may or may not be right about that. But the speech laid out the issues in unusually clear terms. And by any definition, the great wage slowdown \u2013 or its end \u2013 is one of the most important subjects in the country today.\nYou can think of Mr. Obama\u2019s argument as falling into two categories (even if he didn\u2019t say so): the reasons that overall economic growth may accelerate, and the reasons that middle- and low-income workers may benefit more from that growth than they have lately. Both factors have contributed to the wage slowdown. The size of the pie hasn\u2019t been growing very fast, and most of the increases have gone to a small share of already well-fed families.\nOn the growth side of the ledger, both energy and education have been problems. The cost of energy, after temporarily falling in the 1990s, returned to its post-1970s norm in recent years and acted like a tax on the rest of the economy. Education, meanwhile, is the lifeblood of economic growth, allowing people to do entirely new tasks (cure a disease, invent the Internet) or to do old ones with less time and expense. Yet educational attainment has slowed so much that the United States has lost its once-enormous global lead.\nOn both fronts, the country has been making progress, Mr. Obama rightly noted. The fracking boom and a more modest clean-energy boom have increased this country\u2019s share of energy production and held down costs worldwide. The price of oil has been mostly flat for three years.\nAnd the number of high-school and college graduates is rising. The financial crisis deserves some perverse credit, because it sent people fleeing back to school, much as the Great Depression did. But some of the efforts to improve school performance \u2013 by raising standards and accountability \u2013 are also playing a role.\nLast year, 33.6 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds had a four-year college degree, up from 30.8 percent in 2008, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That leaves a lot of room for further improvement, but it\u2019s more progress than in prior years. In 2000, the share was 29.1 percent.\nMr. Obama didn\u2019t mention her in the speech, but another reason for optimism at the White House is Janet Yellen, who took over the Federal Reserve this year. Under Ben Bernanke, her predecessor, the Fed was heroically creative in fighting the financial crisis. After the crisis, though, Fed officials made the same mistake repeatedly: overestimating the health of the economy. Ms. Yellen has suggested that she\u2019s learned that lesson and will be even more aggressive about trying to lift growth with low interest rates.\nAs for the other entry in the ledger, the biggest reason to think economic growth may translate more directly into wage gains is the turnabout in health costs. After years of rapid increases, they have slowed sharply in the last three years. Mr. Obama likes to give more credit to the 2010 health care law than most observers do, but he\u2019s not wrong about the trend\u2019s significance.\nHealth costs take a direct bite out of paychecks. Employers don\u2019t have some secret stash of money to pay for health insurance; when it becomes more expensive, there is less money left for salaries. It\u2019s no accident that the best period of wage growth in the last 40 years \u2013 the late 1990s \u2013 was also a period of quiescent health inflation.\nIf you\u2019re skeptical that these trends are actually encouraging, take a minute to play an alternate-history game. Imagine someone had come to you a few years ago and predicted that health inflation would slow sharply, that the cost of oil would be flat, that the United States would soon produce more oil than it imports and that both the high-school and college graduation rates would rise. Most of us would not have replied: Yeah, that all sounds right.\nBut here\u2019s where I become less optimistic than the president. Imagine that same prognosticator had added one more bit of clairvoyance: Despite all those positive trends, the real median weekly pay of full-time workers in mid-2014 would be slightly lower than it was in mid-2011. Or than it was in mid-2008, the year before Mr. Obama took office. Or in mid-2000.\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that we\u2019re on the verge of a pay surge, much as we were in the mid-1990s, when the situation also seemed bleak. It\u2019s also possible that the forces behind the great wage slowdown \u2013 from globalization to our often-sclerotic government to (at least for many workers) technological change \u2013 are still more powerful than the positive forces. In that case, the wage slowdown won\u2019t end until the country makes much more progress in improving education, cutting medical waste and energy costs and creating a more responsive, nimble government.\nEither way, the great wage slowdown, or the end of it, will help set the tone for American life in the coming decade. It has already done so in the century\u2019s first 15 years, causing widespread unhappiness with the country\u2019s direction and leading voters to shift partisan directions multiple times. The political turmoil isn\u2019t likely to end until the economic reality changes.", "Showers this evening becoming a steady rain overnight. Low 42F. Winds W at 10 to 15 mph.

Colorado features the U.S. Air Force Academy and a collection of Air Force bases. California is California \u2014 large in political stature and economic pressure. But Alabama\u2019s candidacy isn\u2019t a foolish wish. Alabama\u2019s candidacy is real, and it should position our state to strengthen its role in America\u2019s future efforts in space.\nRemember where this began \u2014 with a congressional push to create a sixth branch of the U.S. military, one dedicated solely to the protection of America\u2019s interests in space. When he\u2019s not stumping for President Trump\u2019s xenophobic border wall on the Mexican border, U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks, has been Congress\u2019 leading advocate for a Space Force that operates independently of the Air Force, which the congressman has consistently criticized for what he says is the branch\u2019s reluctance to adequately protect U.S. assets in space.\nIn February, Trump green-lighted the Space Force but gave oversight to the Department of the Air Force, which we assume rankled Rogers\u2019 feathers. But we also know Rogers\u2019 role as the chairman and ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s strategic forces subcommittee could strengthen Alabama\u2019s position to land the U.S. Space Command.\nThe core of Alabama\u2019s candidacy resides in Huntsville, which already claims Redstone Arsenal (where the Space Command and its 1,450 employees would be housed), the Army\u2019s Space and Missile Command, NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center, and the Defense Intelligence Agency\u2019s Missile and Space Intelligence Center. Additionally, north Alabama is home to two prominent rocket-builders: the Jeff Bezos-founded Blue Origin (Huntsville) and United Launch Services (Decatur). Last month, Vice President Mike Pence joined Gov. Kay Ivey in Huntsville for the National Space Council \u2014 a moon-sized feather in the state\u2019s aerospace cap.\nWith this, forget Alabama geography. Huntsville isn\u2019t in Rogers\u2019 3rd Congressional District, but we urge him to join with U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Huntsville, and Sens. Richard Shelby, R-Tuscaloosa, and Doug Jones, D-Birmingham, and reel in this prestigious addition to the American space effort. Alabama makes sense.\nWe\u2019re jealous, by the way. Jealous of north Alabama\u2019s history and hard work and good fortune that in the days after World War II began Huntsville\u2019s transformation into one of America\u2019s top cities for space industries. How we wish northeast Alabama could have had a bit of that prosperity. But we\u2019re also bullish on this opportunity for Alabama.

If they won't do that, then they ought to lose.\"\nHe added that he will personally campaign for someone outside the GOP who represents his values if the party fails to support conservative points of view.\nRepublicans hold a narrow advantage in the House and cannot afford to have conservatives - their most active voters - boycott the polls. At the same time, they don't want to alienate moderate voters in November.\nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich and other GOP congressional leaders met Friday with Dobson and other Christian conservatives to try and heal the rift.\nIn the sometimes contentious meeting, each side aired complaints but left with a common agenda that included eliminating a tax penalty for married couples, scrapping federal funding for the arts and enacting anti-abortion and religious freedom legislation.\nHouse leaders also established a working group, to be led by Rep. Joseph Pitts, R-Pa., to meet weekly with religious right leaders to forward their agenda.\nMost social conservative leaders who were there said afterwards that the two groups made progress in working together.", "Flood premiums are rising again this month in a dreaded springtime ritual, with homeowners seeing anywhere from 5 percent up to 25 percent increases in worst-case scenarios.\nWhile an average hike of 8 percent might seem alarming to some homeowners, the big question that still looms is how much more prices will go up come July 31, the deadline for action on the federal flood insurance program \u2014 or whether that deadline will be met at all.\n\"The only concern I have is the date,\" said Patty Latshaw, principal flood coordinator at Wright National Flood Insurance Company. \"It affects so many people and it\u2019s hard to see it right smack in the middle of hurricane season.\"\nAfter half a dozen temporary extensions, Congress now has until the end of July to renew the National Flood Insurance Program, a government-run program that is the main vehicle for buying flood insurance.\nAs of the beginning of the month, rates for flood insurance went up from $866 on average to $935. That amounts to about an 8 percent hike, though most homeowners\u2019 policies will increase about 5 percent.\nAhead of the deadline, there are three possible outcomes: the NFIP is renewed long term \u2014at least five years \u2014 likely with some changes; Congress pushes off a decision for another short period, saving renewal for after the 2018 midterm elections; or the NFIP is left to lapse.\nIn a worst-case scenario where the NFIP is left to lapse, that means no new policies will be written until action is taken, new and prospective homeowners will be the first to feel the effects.\nFlood insurance is required for most mortgages in designated flood zones. If someone buys a home in such a zone and the NFIP lapsed before they closed on the house, they would not be able to get a flood insurance policy, and thus not be able to go through with the sale.\nA similar issue would hit homeowners whose policies expire after July 31. They would not be able to renew their policies with the NFIP, causing a lapse in coverage.\nIn a less-dire scenario, if the price of flood insurance goes up significantly, home values, could decrease, making it difficult for sellers.\nJon Gentile, vice president of government relations for the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents, said consumers are right to be mildly concerned.\n\"If you\u2019re a homeowner or business owner, there\u2019s uncertainty right now with whether Congress will provide a long term reauthorization,\" Gentile said. \"Consumers certainly have a right to be concerned.\"\nOne change may be in how the NFIP interacts with the private flood insurance market.\nFEMA, private insurers and insurance companies such as Wright \u2014 which has the largest number of NFIP policy holders in the country \u2014 are pushing for Congress to require banks to recognize all flood insurance policies, including those from private insurers. This, they say, gives consumers more choices to satisfy the mandatory coverage.\nCurrently, it\u2019s difficult for a homeowner who receives subsidized rates to switch between being covered by the NFIP and a private flood insurer without losing that reduced rate.\nThat\u2019s because if their mortgage requires continuous flood insurance coverage, it is only considered continuous by the NFIP if it is issued through the NFIP. Even if that homeowner had a policy with a private insurance company for a year, it wouldn\u2019t be counted by the federal program, pushing that homeowner up to higher rates.\n*Most* properties affected by this are called \"pre-FIRM,\" or properties that were built before the first flood insurance rate maps were put into place in 1975. If those property owners had been with NFIP consistently, their rate increases would have been more gradual than trying to get back into the federal program. Only about 20 percent of policies under the NFIP are subsidized, which includes pre-FIRM.\n\"This is the unintended consequences of what Congress passed and what FEMA has to mandate,\" Latshaw said.\nUnder the rates effective April 1, those properties \u2014 as long as they weren\u2019t the owner\u2019s primary residence \u2014 saw a 25 percent rate increase. The rates will continue to increase by 25 percent until they reach what is considered an actuarially-sound price.\nNow is not the time for panic, said Robin Sollie, head of the Tampa Bay Beaches Chamber of Commerce. July 31 is still a ways off, and until legislation is passed or close to being passed, the stakes are not clear.\n\"It\u2019s just been a bit quiet because it has been in a holding pattern and I don\u2019t think really it\u2019s going to get a sense of urgency until we get closer to an expiration,\" Sollie said.\nShore Acres, a waterfront community in Pinellas County, is likely to be among the most affected by flood insurance changes. The low-lying community routinely floods during the summer rainy season, and in 2016, 65 to 92 percent of homes in the community qualified for subsidized flood insurance rates.\nAnd the issue may be in the back of residents\u2019 minds right now because of the deadline extension. Sollie said she hasn\u2019t been approached by any of the residents in her area about flood insurance recently.", "and forth negotiations on the bilateral 123 Agreement to implement the deal are meaningless.\nThe tough terms and conditions for the civilian nuclear engagement with India as laid out in the Henry Hyde Act passed by US Congress in December 2006 and intent of the July 18, 2005 statement are at complete divergence with each other and so it is important to resolve it soon, they say.\nMost of the senior scientists did not want to be quoted barring two former chairmen of the Atomic Energy Commission -- M R Srinivasan and P K Iyengar.\nSrinivasan, Atomic Energy Commission member, said 'now it is the US which has to find a way to resolve the issue as the 123 agreement is only the operational arm of Henry Hyde Act'.\nAsked about Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's [Images] recent suggestion on creating a national reprocessing facility for spent fuel as a civilian facility, he said \"those issues can wait and they are matter of details. But what is important at this juncture is for the Americans to comply by the July 18, 2005 and March 2, 2006 joint statements and for India it is the Prime Minister's promise on the floor of Parliament, he said.\nbased on an 'assay mode' or 'double mode'.\nThat is not possible without revisions in the Hyde Act, some of the Department of Atomic Energy scientists said.\ncountry with a strategic programme and that the US had to come out with a separation plan for nuclear facilities in March 2006, the US knew that India was very strong.\n\"Therefore, the negotiations that took place between March and November 2006 have evolved into a modification of the Atomic Energy Act of the US which was not so rigid in November. However, the conciliation committee when making it final, made it very rigid in complete disregard to any of India's objection, which were on the table,\" Iyengar said.\n\"It takes years to understand the intricacies and nuances of nuclear policy and why should we get into the often whimsical and partisan non-proliferation aspects as promoted by the US from time to time? It is quite clear that the US under secretary Nicholas Burns, who claimed 90 percent completion of the bilateral 123 Agreement talks successfully, seems to have burnt himself,\" he said.\nScientists and policy experts have noted with some amusement the predictable constitution of the \"expert committee\"\nintended to examine in detail issues governing non-proliferation, India's deterrent and other related subjects.\nThe very composition of this handpicked group (a committee of three) and the fact that they have been asked to look into these issues in the few weeks leading up to the July visit to India by US Secretary of State Condolezza Rice, 'is the only aspect of the entire saga that is patently transparent', a senior DAE scientist stated.\nIf indeed the Prime Minister intends to make good his numerous promises to Parliament, no choice remains but to press for substantial changes in the Hyde Act.\nOfficials in the MEA examining the deal have commented in December 2006 that \"the Hyde Act is law and supercedes any bi-lateral agreement. If anything within the 123 Agreement contradicts the Hyde Act, the act will supercede any and all terms of the agreement.\nA known parallel in the case is of the Taiwan Relations Act which supercedes three previous joint communiques with China which is well aware that ultimately the US government will be bound by the terms of the Act, MEA officials had pointed out.\n\"We have hurriedly suggested a national reprocessing facility under international safeguards in an attempt to win the 'up-down' vote and appease the US Congress,\" DAE officials said.\nThe very fact that the US has not responded to India's offer only implies that it does not serve their purpose. Such attempts at subterfuge only highlight that reprocessing is not a right the US wishes to allow India to retain and the Hyde Act can be invoked at any time to override this 'concession', DAE officials added.\nFollowing the footsteps of the latest offer, there is a real fear that bizarre 'concessions', including invoking US Presidential certifications for reprocessing Tarapur fuel (which India can do by right) may be proposed to push through the 123 Agreement entirely on US terms, DAE officials said.\nIf such certifications are allowed, not only does it set a dangerous precedent for the Indian nuclear programme but it puts India squarely in the path of future US Presidential retractions, they warn.\n\"Indian negotiators were attempting to convince us that the Hyde Act is an internal US legislation, not binding on India. Here is another example that the US remains bound by its terms and intends to invoke them to bludgeon India into agreeing (to their terms),\" a few senior scientists said.\n\"Why is India running around trying to engage the IAEA and the NSG when the ball is squarely in the US court to deliver as promised?\" said a few veteran nuclear scientists.\nRather than deliver on their promises and to cover up the fact that they are already welshing, India is made to run around in futility even as the US goes about changing its mind with impunity, DAE officials noted.\n\"If India has to engage in business with US seriously, then New Delhi has to tell the US to revise or modify the Hyde Act,\" they said.\nAnswering a query on wordings of the bilateral agreement which would take care of future problems based on the Taiwan experience of bilateral agreement with US, he said, \"India understands the nuances and we do not lack any expertise in doing so.\"\nagreement. Why this hurry when US legislation is against us?\"\nIyengar said, \"It is surprising that although the Prime Minister has said during his very brief meeting with Bush that India will build a dedicated national facility, he never uttered a word about the Henry Hyde Act of December 2006 which is very much linked to 123 Agreement.\"", "Sebastian Junger's book is doing tremendous damage to the public perception of veterans, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide.\nSebastian Junger\u2019s book is doing tremendous damage to the public perception of veterans, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide.\nJunger has sat for many national and local television and radio interviews, and his book has been widely reviewed. It is currently a top best seller in many categories on Amazon and has been on the New York Times best seller list for three weeks now. This is a very popular book, that has received an enormous amount of media attention, and unfortunately, it is doing a great degree of harm by misinforming people about the nature, magnitude, and reality of PTSD for America\u2019s veterans. It\u2019s hard enough to get people to understand what the guys went through over there and what they are going through at home, let alone if people are misinformed.\nA New York Times article last year documented the suffering of Marines from 2/7. That battalion has a suicide rate 14 times higher than their civilian peers. Over all, Iraq and Afghan veterans have a suicide rate three to four times that of their civilian peers, but when you look at those who have seen combat, that rate rises to 10 to 14 times.\nTalk to any Marine or Army infantrymen who fought in Afghanistan or Iraq and he can probably rattle off the names of six, seven, eight, or more guys who have killed themselves since coming home. Junger saying every chance he gets that suicide and combat are not linked is incredibly dangerous. Misinformation like this will hurt veterans just as much as silence about the psychological effects of war hurt previous generations of veterans.\nMatthew Hoh is a senior fellow with the Center for International Policy. He served with the Marines in Iraq (2006 to 2007), and with State Department teams in Iraq (2004 to 2005) and Afghanistan (2009).", "Mobile by Sainbury's, the new network created in a partnership of the UK supermarket chain and Vodafone, has launched with three pay-as-you-go price plans that earn customers double Nectar points for their Sainsbury's shopping or fuel.\nWhen a Mobile by Sainsbury's PAYG bundle is bought by a customer, they can link it to their Nectar card, and each purchase in store from then on will earn double the amount of points as normal.
